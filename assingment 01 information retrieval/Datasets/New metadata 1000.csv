5kf80xs5,,WHO,Data-Driven Insights on the Effects of COVID-19 on Public Interest in Medical Aesthetics: Part II (Active Analysis),,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected financial and psychosocial factors that influence plastic surgery demand. OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to actively assess public interest changes and the reasons underlying these shifts. METHODS: Using Amazons' Mechanical Turk, we crowdsourced public opinions regarding aesthetic interventions from April 30 to May 3, 2020. The survey assessed prior experience with and interest in 6 aesthetic interventions before and during the pandemic and reasons for changing interest. United States residents aged 18 years and over who passed the attention check were included. RESULTS: We included 704 of 838 total responses. One-half of respondents were female; the median age group was 25 to 34 years. During the pandemic, 21% of respondents had increased and 33% decreased interest in at least one intervention. Non-invasive procedures (7.3%), facial aesthetic surgery (6.6%), and medical-grade skincare (5.9%) elicited the greatest interest increase. Seeing themselves in the mirror more often (43.2%), desire to look better after the crisis (41.8%), and increased time on social media (40.4%) were the top reasons for increased interest. The most common reasons for decreased interest were changing spending priorities (58%), focusing on other health aspects (49.8%), and worrying about infection in medical facilities (46.3%). Almost one-half of respondents considered virtual consultations for interventions of increased interest. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected interest in medical aesthetics. Offering telemedicine and discussing detailed COVID-19 infection control policies with patients will be critical to address patient needs and concerns. These findings can be used to improve patient outreach, advertisement, and counseling as practices focus on reopening.",2020,"Jenny, Hillary E; Chandawarkar, Akash; Kim, Roy",Aesthet. surg. j,,#892072,,,,,225083793.0

Design After experiencing 105 cases of laparoscopic and robotic radical trachelectomy with a 5 year survival rate of 98% and the birth of 29 babies from 51 of these patients who attempted pregnancy, we introduced the double bipolar method to overcome technical difficulties of the procedure due to the necessity for precise dissection and reconstruction in the deep pelvis. We will show our operative techniques, such as nerve sparing radical trachelectomy and retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy for early invasive cervical cancer in a bloodless operative field. Setting Urban general hospital. Patients or Participants Robotic radical trachelectomy using the double bipolar method was performed in three patients with 1b1 cervical cancer. Interventions After Robotic radical trachelectomy using monopolar scissors in 30 cases of stage Ib1 cervical cancer, we considered techniques for a more bloodless operative field. The double bipolar method (DBM) was originated by a robotic gastrointestinal surgeon, Prof Ichiro Uyama. Using robotic Maryland forceps as a cutting device allows for pinpoint accuracy that cannot be found in other instruments. It is important for bladder and ureteral dissection and exposure of vessels. Cuts are made at a very limited point by a lightning strike mechanism, meaning there is minimal thermal spread to adjacent organs. Measurements and Main Results Blood loss was 250ml in the cases presented. In surgeries not using the DBM(n=34), the blood loss ranged from 350ml(100-1200ml). While there is no supporting data, the dissection of the ureter was very smooth. Conclusion A bloodless operative field allows for accurate dissection and can prevent intraoperative injuries. The double bipolar method is able to provide precision cutting and limit thermal spread to adjacent tissue, reducing injury and allowing for a clear operative field.",2020-12-31,"Andou, M.; Kanno, K.; Sawada, M.",Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology,,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1553465020305707; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1553465020305707,224769563.0

Meanwhile, there is growing consensus across scientific disciplines that fish plays a crucial role in food and nutrition security. However, this ‘fish as food’ perspective has yet to translate into policy and development funding priorities. We argue that the traditional framing of fish as a natural resource emphasizes economic development and biodiversity conservation objectives, whereas situating fish within a food systems perspective can lead to innovative policies and investments that promote nutrition-sensitive and socially equitable capture fisheries and aquaculture. This paper highlights four pillars of research needs and policy directions toward this end. Ultimately, recognizing and working to enhance the role of fish in alleviating hunger and malnutrition can provide an additional long-term development incentive, beyond revenue generation and biodiversity conservation, for governments, international development organizations, and society more broadly to invest in the sustainability of capture fisheries and aquaculture.

In the absence of a full-length molecular clone, however, it has been difficult to address the role of individual viral genes in pathogenesis. By using targeted RNA recombination to introduce the S gene of MHV4, a highly neurovirulent strain, into the genome of MHV-A59, a mildly neurovirulent strain, we have been able to directly address the role of the S gene in neurovirulence. In cell culture, the recombinants containing the MHV4 S gene, S4R22 and S4R21, exhibited a small-plaque phenotype and replicated to low levels, similar to wild-type MHV4. Intracranial inoculation of C57BL/6 mice with S4R22 and S4R21 revealed a marked alteration in pathogenesis. Relative to wild-type control recombinant viruses (wtR13 and wtR9), containing the MHV-A59 S gene, the MHV4 S gene recombinants exhibited a dramatic increase in virulence and an increase in both viral antigen staining and inflammation in the central nervous system. There was not, however, an increase in the level of viral replication in the brain. These studies demonstrate that the MHV4 S gene alone is sufficient to confer a highly neurovirulent phenotype to a recombinant virus deriving the remainder of its genome from a mildly neurovirulent virus, MHV-A59. This definitively confirms previous findings, suggesting that the spike is a major determinant of pathogenesis.",1999,"Phillips, J J; Chua, M M; Lavi, E; Weiss, S R",Journal of virology,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10438865/,25337050.0

Although the overlap method is a safe and feasible approach for esophagojejunostomy, it has several technical limitations. We developed novel modifications for the overlap method to overcome these disadvantages. METHODS Forty-eight consecutive gastric cancer patients underwent totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy or laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with double-tract reconstruction at our institution from January 2019 to April 2020 using the overlap method with the following modifications. The esophagus was initially rotated by 90° counterclockwise, followed by transection of two-thirds of the esophageal diameter. The unstapled esophagus was then transected with a harmonic ultrasonic scalpel to enable esophagostomy at the posterior side of the esophagus. A side-to-side esophagojejunostomy was then formed at the posterior side of the esophagus using an endoscopic linear stapler through the right lower trocar. The common entry hole was closed via hand sewing method using V-Loc suture. This procedure was termed ""esophagus two-step-cut overlap method."" RESULTS Only one patient suffered from esophagojejunal anastomotic leakage but subsequently recovered after conservative treatment. Patients did not experience anastomotic bleeding or stricture.

In this study, we assessed the variations in concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) during the holidays in the heating season from 2014 to 2018 based on daily surface air quality monitoring measurements in Beijing. A Generalized Additive Model (GAM) is used to analyze pollutant concentrations for 34 sites by comprehensively accounting for annual, monthly, and weekly cycles as well as the nonlinear impacts of meteorological factors. A Saturday effect was found in the downtown area, with about 4% decrease in PM2.5 and 3% decrease in NO2 relative to weekdays. On Sundays, the PM2.5 concentrations increased by about 5% whereas there were no clear changes for NO2. In contrast to the small effect of the weekend, there was a strong holiday effect throughout the region with average increases of about 22% in PM2.5 and average reductions of about 11% in NO2 concentrations. There was a clear geographical pattern in the strength of the holiday effect. In rural areas the increase in PM2.5 is related to the proportion of coal and biomass consumption for household heating. In the suburban areas between the Fifth Ring Road and Sixth Ring Road there were larger reductions in NO2 than downtown which might be due to decreased traffic as many people return to their hometown for the holidays.

Several lines of evidence suggest geriatric syndromes need to be assessed but little is known on their relative effect on the 30-day survival after ICU admission. The primary aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of frailty, cognition decline and activity of daily life in addition to the presence of comorbidity and polypharmacy and to assess their influence on 30-day survival. METHODS: Prospective cohort study with 242 ICUs from 22 countries. Patients 80 years or above acutely admitted over a six months period to an ICU between May 2018 and May 2019 were included. In addition to common patients’ characteristics and disease severity, we collected information on specific geriatric syndromes as potential predictive factors for 30-day survival, frailty (Clinical Frailty scale) with a CFS > 4 defining frail patients, cognitive impairment (informant questionnaire on cognitive decline in the elderly (IQCODE) with IQCODE ≥ 3.5 defining cognitive decline, and disability (measured the activity of daily life with the Katz index) with ADL ≤ 4 defining disability. A Principal Component Analysis to identify co-linearity between geriatric syndromes was performed and from this a multivariable model was built with all geriatric information or only one: CFS, IQCODE or ADL. Akaike’s information criterion across imputations was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of our models. RESULTS: We included 3920 patients with a median age of 84 years (IQR: 81–87), 53.3% males). 80% received at least one organ support. The median ICU length of stay was 3.88 days (IQR: 1.83–8). The ICU and 30-day survival were 72.5% and 61.2% respectively. The geriatric conditions were median (IQR): CFS: 4 (3–6); IQCODE: 3.19 (3–3.69); ADL: 6 (4–6); Comorbidity and Polypharmacy score (CPS): 10 (7–14). CFS, ADL and IQCODE were closely correlated. The multivariable analysis identified predictors of 1-month mortality (HR; 95% CI): Age (per 1 year increase): 1.02 (1.–1.03, p = 0.01), ICU admission diagnosis, sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA) (per point): 1.15 (1.14–1.17, p < 0.0001) and CFS (per point): 1.1 (1.05–1.15, p < 0.001). CFS remained an independent factor after inclusion of life-sustaining treatment limitation in the model. CONCLUSION: We confirm that frailty assessment using the CFS is able to predict short-term mortality in elderly patients admitted to ICU. Other geriatric syndromes do not add improvement to the prediction model. Since CFS is easy to measure, it should be routinely collected for all elderly ICU patients in particular in connection to advance care plans, and should be used in decision making.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of minimum and maximum rise time and inspiratory cycling criteria settings on 6 new generation ventilators. Our hypothesis was there would be a difference in the exhaled tidal volume, inspiratory time, and peak flow among 6 different ventilators, based, on change in rise time and cycling criteria. METHODS The research utilized a breathing simulator and 4 different ventilator models. All mechanical ventilators were set to a spontaneous mode of ventilation with settings of pressure support 8 cm H2O and PEEP of 5 cm H2O. A minimum and maximum setting for rise time and cycling criteria were examined. Exhaled tidal volume, inspiratory time, and peak flow measurements were recorded for each simulation. RESULTS Significant (P < .001) differences were found when comparing minimum and maximum rise time and minimum and maximum cycling criteria for each ventilator. CONCLUSIONS Significant differences in exhaled tidal volume, inspiratory time, and peak flow were observed by adjusting rise time and cycling criteria. This research demonstrates that during pressure support ventilation strategy, adjustments in rise time and/or cycling criteria can produce changes in inspiratory parameters. Obviously, this finding has important implications for practitioners who utilize a similar pressure support strategy when conducting a ventilator wean. Additionally, this study outlines major differences among ventilator manufacturers when considering inspiratory rise time and cycling criteria.",2013,"Gonzales, Joshua F; Russian, Christopher J; Gregg Marshall, S; Collins, Kevin P",Respiratory care,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22781498/,10074874.0

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe the utilization of physician consultations, specialist referrals, hospital admissions, and the recognition of incident diseases in Germany for this age group during the COVID-19 lockdown. DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING: 1,095 general practitioners' (GPs) and 960 specialist practices in Germany. SUBJECTS: 2.45 million older patients aged 65 or older. METHODS: The number of documented physician consultations, specialist referrals, hospital admissions, and incident diagnoses during the imposed lockdown in 2020 was descriptively analyzed and compared to 2019. RESULTS: Physician consultations decrease slightly in February (-2%), increase before the imposed lockdown in March (+9%), and decline in April (-18%) and May (-14%) 2020 compared to the same periods in 2019. Volumes of hospital admissions decrease earlier and more intensely than physician consultations (-39% vs. -6% respectively). Overall, 15%, 16%, and 18% fewer incident diagnoses were documented by GPs, neurologists, and diabetologists respectively in 2020. Diabetes, dementia, depression, cancer, and stroke were diagnosed less frequently during the lockdown (-17% to -26%), meaning that the decrease in the recognition of diseases was greater than the decrease in physician consultations. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that organizational changes were adopted quickly by practice management, but also raise concerns about the maintenance of routine care.

However, few studies have been conducted to investigate whether IN is effective even in treatment-refractory cases, such as in those with steroid dependency and anti-TNF refractoriness. METHODS In the INDIGO study, 86 patients with active UC were randomly assigned to an IN group (0.5-2.0 g daily) or placebo group. The rate of clinical response (CR), mucosal healing (MH), and change in fecal calprotectin (FCP) levels was compared between refractory [patients with steroid-dependent disease, previous use of anti-TNF-α, and concomitant use of immunomodulators (IM)] and non-refractory patients. We also analyzed factors predicting CR and MH at week 8. RESULTS The rates of CR of IN group were significantly higher than placebo group, even in patients with steroid-dependent disease (p < 0.001), previous use of anti-TNF-α (p = 0.002), and concomitant use of IM (p = 0.013). The rates of MH in IN group were significantly higher than in placebo group in patients with steroid-dependent disease (p = 0.009). In the IN group, median FCP levels, at week 8, were significantly lower than baseline in patients with steroid-dependent disease and patients with the previous use of anti-TNF-α (p < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that the previous use of anti-TNF-α was not a predictive factor for CR and MH at week 8.

STUDY DESIGN Multi-institutional case series. ANIMALS Client-owned dogs (n=20). METHODS Medical records of dogs that underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy were reviewed and signalment, history, clinical and ultrasound examination findings, surgical variables, and complications were collated. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed using a multiport approach. Data were compared between dogs with successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy and dogs requiring conversion to open cholecystectomy. RESULTS Six dogs (30%) required conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy due to inability to ligate the cystic duct (3), evidence of gall bladder rupture (1), leakage from the cystic duct during dissection (1), and cardiac arrest (1). Cystic duct dissection was performed in 19 dogs using an articulating dissector (10), right angle forceps (7), and unrecorded (2). The cystic duct was ligated in 15 dogs using surgical clips (5), suture (6), or a combination (4). All dogs were discharged from the hospital and had resolution of clinical signs, although 1 dog developed pancreatitis and 1 dog required revision surgery for bile peritonitis. There was no significant difference in preoperative blood analysis results, surgical technique, or duration of hospitalization between dogs undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and cases converted to open cholecystectomy.

Such cross-reactivity may lead to an autoimmune disease. On the other hand molecular mimicry between certain viral proteins and host determinant may protect invading virus to be eliminated by immune system and may promote persistence. In this mini-review I discuss the molecular mimicry of S peplomer protein of mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM (MHV-JHM) to the host Fc gamma receptor (Fc gamma R). MHV-JHM induces in rodents acute encephalomyelitis and surviving animals develop demyelinating disease with concomitant persistent infection. We have demonstrated that rabbit IgG, but not is F(ab')2 fragments, monoclonal rat and mouse IgG and the rat 2.4G2 anti-Fc gamma R mab immunoprecipitated natural and recombinant S peplomer protein of several strains of MHV. Furthermore, MHV-JHM infected cells formed rosettes with anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) - antibody coated SRBC. The 2.4G2 anti-Fc gamma R mab are able to neutralize several strains of MHV, presumably by binding to S peplomer protein. Therefore, the Fc binding site of S is present on the surface of MHV-infected cells. This molecular mimicry between S peplomer protein of MHV-JHM and Fc gamma R has been extended to other members of Coronaviridae, namely bovine coronavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus but not to infectious bronchitis virus.

METHODS All available databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE(®) and Embase™ were searched in February 2011 and cross-referenced for available English literature describing SPILA in patients of any age. RESULTS Three broad technical approaches are described: procedures using laparoscopic instruments through a single skin incision in the abdominal wall, regardless of the number of fascial incisions, with or without the additional use of percutaneous sutures or wires to 'assist' the operation, and hybrid procedures, in which the appendix is exteriorised using a single incision laparoscopically assisted operation but subsequently divided using a conventional 'open' appendicectomy technique.

METHODS: A prospective study following pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19 who delivered between March 15th and July 4th in seven university affiliated hospitals in Israel. RESULTS: A total of 52 women with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 delivered in the participating centers during the study period. The median gestational age at the time of delivery was 38 weeks, with 16 (30.8%) cases complicated by spontaneous preterm birth. Forty-three women (82.7%) underwent a trial of labor. The remaining 9 women underwent pre-labor cesarean delivery mostly due to obstetric indications, whereas one woman with a critical COVID-19 course underwent urgent cesarean delivery due to maternal deterioration. Among those who underwent a trial of labor (n = 43), 39 (90.7%) delivered vaginally, whereas 4 (9.3%) cases resulted in cesarean delivery.

The improvement of prevention and treatment of viral infections and their associated diseases remains one of the main public health challenges. Towards this goal, deciphering virus–host molecular interactions opens new perspectives to understand the biology of infection and for the design of new antiviral strategies. Indeed, modelling of an infection network between viral and cellular proteins will provide a conceptual and analytic framework to efficiently formulate new biological hypothesis at the proteome scale and to rationalize drug discovery. Therefore, we present the first release of VirHostNet (Virus–Host Network), a public knowledge base specialized in the management and analysis of integrated virus–virus, virus–host and host–host interaction networks coupled to their functional annotations. VirHostNet integrates an extensive and original literature-curated dataset of virus–virus and virus–host interactions (2671 non-redundant interactions) representing more than 180 distinct viral species and one of the largest human interactome (10 672 proteins and 68 252 non-redundant interactions) reconstructed from publicly available data.

SUMMARY: Here, we are reviewing how changing the host metabolism, particularly changing the host metabolic state from the carbohydrate-dependent glycolytic state to a fat-dependent ketogenic state, may affect viral replication. Furthermore, the impact of intermittent fasting (IF) in triggering metabolic switch along with the impact of supplementation with medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) such as lauric acid in repressing the envelope formation and viral replication is also addressed. The amalgamation of IF and a ketogenic diet rich in MCTs is thought to work as a prophylactic measure for normal people and adjunct therapy for infected persons. KEY MESSAGE: A diet regimen of ketogenic breakfast along with supplementation with two doses of lauric acid-rich MCTs at breakfast and lunch times, followed by 8–12-h IF and a dinner rich with fruits and vegetables, could be a potential prophylactic strategy and adjuvant therapy to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections.",2020-09-18,"Soliman, Sameh; Faris, MoezAlIslam E.; Ratemi, Zakaria; Halwani, Rabih",Ann Nutr Metab,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/80c0c77b68eca21e529e75650df9741b9e22eb62.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7573915.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32950986/; https://doi.org/10.1159/000510508,221827732.0

However, the effectiveness of chart rounds in detecting problematic treatment plans is unknown. We performed a prospective blinded study of error detection at chart rounds to clarify the effectiveness of this quality assurance step. METHODS AND MATERIALS Radiation Oncology Incident Learning System publications were queried for problematic plans approved for treatment that would be detectable at chart rounds. A resident physician, physicist, and dosimetrist collaboratively generated 20 treatment plans with simulated errors identical in nature to those reported to the Radiation Oncology Incident Learning System. These were inserted randomly into weekly chart rounds over 9 weeks, with a median of 2 problematic plans presented per chart rounds (range, 1-4). Data were collected on detection, attendance, length, and number of cases presented at chart rounds. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and univariable logistic regression with odds ratios. RESULTS The median length of chart rounds over the study period was 60 minutes (range, 42-79); median number of cases presented per chart rounds was 45 (range, 38-50). The overall detection rate was 55% (11 of 20). Detection rates were higher for cases presented earlier in chart rounds: 75% versus 25% of problematic plans were detected within 30 minutes of start of chart rounds versus after 30 minutes (odds ratio, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.01-0.88; P = .037). Detection rates showed a trend toward increase during the study period but this was not significant: 33% in weeks 1 to 5 and 73% during weeks 6 to 9 (5.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-36; P = .08).

PPSTs are routinely resected by a transcervical approach using blind finger dissection. Large PPSTs or those located high at the skull base, often require transmandibular or infratemporal fossa approaches, associated with considerable morbidity. Objective Here, we describe an approach for PPST removal that comprises transcervical endoscopic, with or without transoral robotic technique. Materials and Methods We retrospectively studied the demographic, clinical, surgical, and outcome data of 11 consecutive patients who underwent PPST excision between June 2013 and July 2017 at our center. Patients either underwent a transcervical endoscopic procedure ( n = 4), a transoral robotic procedure ( n = 2) or a combination of the two procedures ( n = 5). Results Complete tumor excision was achieved in all cases, with no intra-, peri-, or postoperative complications. Final histopathologic findings demonstrated pleomorphic adenoma for seven patients, cavernous hemangioma for one patient, and malignant tumors for three patients. The average tumor size was 44.22 ± 31.9 cm 3 (range: 7.5-111 cm 3 ). At follow-up (range: 3-42 months), there was no evidence of recurrence. Conclusions The approach described provides improved visualization and safe vascular control with minimum tumor stress, preventing the need for blind finger dissection, and allowing complete tumor removal while minimizing tumor spillage, nerve injury, and blood loss, maintaining excellent cosmetic and functional results.

Here we created monomeric and trimeric fluorescent RBD proteins, derived from adherent HEK293T, as well as in GnTI mutant cells, to analyze the effect of complex vs high mannose glycosylation on receptor binding. The results demonstrate that trimeric fully glycosylated proteins are superior in receptor binding compared to monomeric and immaturely glycosylated variants. Although differences in binding to commonly used cell lines were minimal between the different RBD preparations, substantial differences were observed when respiratory tissues of experimental animals were stained.

Interventions are not established. On the basis of the link between inflammation, fibrosis, aldosterone, and extracellular matrix regulation, we aimed to investigate the effect of an early intervention with the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) eplerenone on cardiac remodelling in a murine model of persistent coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis. METHODS AND RESULTS: SWR/J mice were infected with 5 × 104 plaque-forming units of CVB3 (Nancy strain) and daily treated either with eplerenone (200 mg/kg body weight) or with placebo starting from Day 1. At Day 8 or 28 post infection, mice were haemodynamically characterized and subsequently sacrificed for immunohistological and molecular biology analyses. Eplerenone did not influence CVB3 load. Already at Day 8, 1.8-fold (P < 0.05), 1.4-fold (P < 0.05), 3.2-fold (P < 0.01), and 2.1-fold (P < 0.001) reduction in LV intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression, presence of monocytes/macrophages, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, respectively, was observed in eplerenone-treated vs. untreated CVB3-infected mice. In vitro, eplerenone led to 1.4-fold (P < 0.01) and 1.2-fold (P < 0.01) less CVB3-induced cardiomyocyte oxidative stress and apoptosis. Furthermore, collagen production was 1.1-fold (P < 0.05) decreased in cardiac fibroblasts cultured with medium of eplerenone-treated vs. untreated CVB3-infected HL-1 cardiomyocytes. These ameliorations were in vivo translated into prevention of cardiac fibrosis, as shown by 1.4-fold (P < 0.01) and 2.1-fold (P < 0.001) lower collagen content in the LV of eplerenone-treated vs. untreated CVB3-infected mice at Days 8 and 28, respectively. This resulted in an early and long-lasting improvement of LV dimension and function, as indicated by reduced LV end-systolic volume and end-diastolic volume, and an increase in LV contractility (dP/dtmax ) and LV relaxation (dP/dtmin ), respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Early intervention with the MRA eplerenone modulates the acute host and defence reaction and prevents cardiac disease progression in experimental CVB3-induced myocarditis without aggravation of viral load. The findings advocate for an initiation of therapy of viral myocarditis as early as possible, even before the onset of inflammation-induced myocardial dysfunction.

Here we show that monocytes engulf CPPs via macropinocytosis, and this process is strictly dependent on CaSR signaling triggered by increases in [Ca2+]ex. Enhanced macropinocytosis of CPPs results in increased lysosomal activity, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and IL-1β release. Monocytes in the context of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) exhibit increased CPP uptake and IL-1β release in response to CaSR signaling. CaSR expression in these monocytes and local [Ca2+] in afflicted joints are increased, probably contributing to this enhanced response.

k2s6fqrj,,WHO,Ferritin levels in patients with COVID-19: A poor predictor of mortality and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis,,,,unk,"INTRODUCTION: A hyperinflammatory environment has been a hallmark of COVID-19 infection and is thought to be a key mediator of morbidity. Elevated ferritin has been observed in many patients with COVID-19. Several retrospective studies have shown ferritin levels can be correlated and predictive of poor outcomes in COVID-19, though a rigorous analysis has been lacking. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 942 adult COVID-19 patients admitted in March 2020 at a large New York City health system with available ferritin levels. RESULTS: The primary outcome, all-cause mortality, was observed in 265 (28.1%) patients. Patients who died had a significantly higher median admission and maximum ferritin levels than those who did not. However, death was poorly predicted by admission and maximum ferritin levels on receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis, with AUCs of 0.677 and 0.638, respectively. AUCs increased when the cohort was limited to progressively younger patients. Ferritin levels were minimally better at predicting our secondary outcomes. These included mechanical ventilation, observed in 280 (29.7%) patients with an ROC yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.769, and new renal replacement therapy, observed in 80 (8.5%) of patients with an ROC yielding an AUC of 0.787. We also performed a subset analysis on 22 patients with ferritins >20 000 ng/mL. None of the patients met HLH-2004 diagnostic criteria. Fifteen (68.2%) of these patients had suspected or confirmed bacterial infections. CONCLUSIONS: Though many patients with COVID-19 present with hyperferritinemia, elevated ferritin levels are not accurate predictors of outcomes and do not appear to be indicative of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.",2020,"Feld, Jonathan; Tremblay, Douglas; Thibaud, Santiago; Kessler, Alaina; Naymagon, Leonard",Int J Lab Hematol,,#713319,,,,,221121572.0

In 2011, the diagnosis of DES was refined based on the occurrence of premature (rather than rapid) contractions by high-resolution manometry. New therapeutic options have also been recently proposed. Thus, a review on DES incorporating publications since 2012 is timely because of these revisions in definition and management. RECENT FINDINGS DES remains a heterogeneous clinical disorder. Its pathophysiology is still debated and DES might be related to achalasia. Alternatively, it might be secondary to medications, especially opiates. Endoscopic ultrasound might be informative diagnostically by demonstrating muscularis propria hypertrophy and thickening. Botulinum toxin injection in the esophageal body has been shown superior to placebo to relieve symptoms associated with DES. Finally, per oral endoscopic myotomy is a promising therapeutic approach, but may be less effective in DES than in achalasia. SUMMARY The diagnosis of DES should lead to a systematic search for medication that might promote the occurrence of esophageal dysmotility.

Early recognition of brain ischaemia may improve the final outcome of the trauma victim. The primary aim of this study was to examine the correlation between peripheral oxygen pulse oximetry and brain oxygen saturation measured by a near infrared oximetry device. A second aim was to evaluate the influence of different factors such as fluid and blood administration on brain tissue oxygenation. METHODS This was a prospective pilot study. Mechanically ventilated trauma patients admitted to the trauma unit had cerebral-somatic oxygen saturation monitoring. Oximeter readings (rSO2) were prospectively collected and compared with concurrent values for peripheral pulse oximetry (SO2). Data were recorded every 15 min and during interventions such as administration of a fluid bolus and blood administration. All interventions were based on accepted clinical parameters. RESULTS Thirty-three patients were enrolled. A total of 210 simultaneous measurements of rSO2 and pulse oximetry values were performed. There was correlation between these two parameters in only one third of patients. Twenty-seven events of possible brain ischemia, defined as rSO2 values less than 50 or a decrease of more than 20% from the baseline, were observed. In 68 (77.2%) of these measurements there was no decrease of peripheral SO2. Significant increases in rSO2 were observed only during administration of fluid boluses.

37v3hl11,,WHO,"Could natural products modulate early inflammatory responses, preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19-confirmed patients?",,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: The ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) is a severe respiratory syndrome that was recently associated as the main death cause in the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. Hence, in order to prevent ARDS, the pulmonary function maintenance has been the target of several pharmacological approaches. However, there is a lack of reports regarding the use of effective pharmaceutical active natural products (PANPs) for early treatment and prevention of COVID-19-related ARDS. Therefore, the aim of this work was to conduct a systematic review regarding the PANPs that could be further studied as alternatives to prevent ARDS. Consequently, this work can pave the way to spread the use of PANPs on the prevention of ARDS in COVID-19-confirmed or -suspected patients. METHODS: The search strategy included scientific studies published in English from 2015 to 2020 that promoted the elucidation of anti-inflammatory pathways targeting ARDS by in vitro and/or in vivo experiments using PANPs. Then, 74 studies regarding PANPs, able to maintain or improve the pulmonary function, were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The PANPs may present different pulmonary anti-inflammatory pathways, wherein (i) reduction/attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, (ii) increase of the anti-inflammatory mediators' levels, (iii) pulmonary edema inhibition and (iv) attenuation of lung injury were the most observed biological effects of such products in in vitro experiments or in clinical studies. Finally, this work highlighted the PANPs with promising potential to be used on respiratory syndromes, allowing their possible use as alternative treatment at the prevention of ARDS in COVID-19-infected or -suspected patients.",2021,"Amaral-Machado, Lucas; Oliveira, Wógenes N; Rodrigues, Victor M; Albuquerque, Nathan A; Alencar, Éverton N; Egito, Eryvaldo S T",Biomed Pharmacother,,#978231,,,,,229691225.0

The consequences vary in most cases and these anomalies lead to severe coronary hypo-perfusion and ventricular dysfunction. The common variants of this cardiac malformation are an anomalous origin of a left coronary artery from a pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) and anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from a pulmonary artery (ARCAPA). Another rare variant is left main coronary artery atresia that resembles ALCAPA in its mode of presentation. This article presents a single surgeon experience of managing this complex subset of the coronary anomaly from April 2006 to July 2019. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 105 patients, who underwent surgery for AOCAPA from April 2006 to July 2019, have been included in the study. The patients have been analysed by follow-up echocardiography and electrocardiography (ECG) at our hospital by paediatric cardiologists. Out of 105 patients of AOCAPA, 98 (93.3%) patients underwent ALCAPA repair, of which 59 (60.2%) were males and 39 (39.7%) were females. Four out of five patients, who had an anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the right pulmonary artery (ALCARPA), had an intramural aortic course. Three patients (3%) had left main coronary artery atresia and four patients (4%) had ARCAPA. It may be mentioned that seven infants (7.14%) and one adult patient (1%) underwent concomitant mitral valve repair. All the patients with ALCAPA, left main coronary artery atresia and ARCAPA, and 1 of the patients with ALCARPA, underwent coronary relocation. In four out of five patients with ALCARPA, unroofing of intra-aortic intramural course was performed. RESULTS: Out of 105 patients of AOCAPA, 9 (8.5%) patients had in-hospital mortality. Five infants (5.0%) with ALCAPA and one patient (1%) with ALCARPA died in the post-operative period due to severe left ventricular dysfunction, mitral regurgitation (MR) and sepsis. One adult patient (1%) with ALCAPA, who underwent coronary relocation using in situ trap door technique and mitral valve (MV) repair, died due to massive intracranial bleeding. Two patients out of three (66.6%) with left main coronary atresia died in intensive care unit (ICU) after 3rd and 4th postoperative day, due to low cardiac output, severe ventricular dysfunction and severe MR. Patients were followed up for a median 5.9 years. Seven patients were lost to follow-up, including the sole survivor of left main coronary atresia, after a median follow-up of 4 years after surgery. Three patients underwent mitral valve replacement for progressive residual MR. There has been no late mortality. CONCLUSION: AOCAPA is a rare congenital cardiac anomaly, which usually presents in infancy with left ventricular dysfunction and mitral valve regurgitation. Early diagnosis and surgical re-establishment of the dual coronary system has given gratifying results, with improvement in left ventricular function in survivors.

Results from an experimental study in a porcine model.,10.1007/s00464-008-0185-5,,18855052,unk,"BACKGROUND Mesh reinforcement in hiatal hernia surgery is debated. Randomized controlled trials have shown that recurrences may be reduced, but there is also the fear of mesh-related complications. Experimental studies on the characteristics of specific mesh types with regard to the risk of such complications are rare. The current study aimed to investigate the properties of a circular heavy-weight polypropylene mesh in terms of stenosis, migration, erosions, and adhesions in a porcine model. METHODS A 55 x 55-mm heavy-weight polypropylene mesh with a 16.5-mm eccentric hole for the esophagus corresponding to a calculated mesh area of 2811 mm(2) and a hole area of 214 mm(2) were implanted in nine German Landrace pigs. Six weeks later, the meshes were explanted and investigated for size, shrinkage, migration and adhesions. RESULTS The total mesh area shrank to a mean of 2,040 +/- 178 mm(2) (p < 0.001), and the hole for the esophagus showed a trend toward an increase to 239 +/- 38 mm(2) (p = 0.108).

The main protease (M(pro)) of SARS-CoV-2 is a promising drug target due to its indispensable role in viral replication inside the host. Using a combined two-steps approach of virtual screening and molecular docking techniques, we have screened an in-house collection of small molecules, mainly composed of natural and nature-inspired compounds. The molecules were selected with high structural diversity to cover a wide range of chemical space into the enzyme pockets. Virtual screening experiments were performed using the blind docking mode of the AutoDock Vina software. Virtual screening allowed the selection of structurally heterogeneous compounds capable of interacting effectively with the enzymatic site of SARS-CoV-2 M(pro). The compounds showing the best interaction with the protein were re-scored by molecular docking as implemented in AutoDock, while the stability of the complexes was tested by molecular dynamics. The most promising candidates revealed a good ability to fit into the protein binding pocket and to reach the catalytic dyad.

Patients and Methods: This retrospective observational study included 80 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases. Data were collected from the electronic medical record system by a trained team of physicians. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TB), albumin, and prealbumin levels at admission and on day 7 after admission were collected. The primary outcome of the current study was patient mortality. Results: Abnormal ALT, AST, TB, albumin, and prealbumin levels were observed in 11 (13.8%), 15 (18.8%), 5 (6.3%), 22 (27.5%), and 31 (38.8%) patients, respectively.

On the other hand, in a pandemic situation, numerous hospitals have suffered periods of great healthcare pressure. The objective of this work was to present an experience of medicalization of a residence where almost 50% of the residents contracted the disease. METHODS A multidisciplinary intervention was carried out in a publicly owned nursing home with 99 residents. Specialists from Internal Medicine, Primary Care and health technicians worked together, in close collaboration with the residence workers. The presence of nursing personnel 24 hours a day and medical personnel with daily visits was enabled. The center was provided with the necessary means to administer the medication (oral and intravenous) and oxygen therapy necessary to care for patients with the disease. Analytical results were available within 24 hours. For data analysis, the percentages were calculated and the mean was used as a measure of central tendency.

Initially, the patient was fixed in a semiprone position, from which he could be rotated to a prone or left lateral position. Four ports were inserted, and then the patient was rotated to the prone position. Once the patient was prone, gravity caused the lung to move downwards.

Esophagectomy was then performed, and the lymph nodes in the middle and lower mediastinum and along the right recurrent laryngeal nerve were dissected. In the left upper mediastinum, lymph node dissection was performed after the residual esophagus was stripped. Stripping of the residual esophagus created sufficient working space and a clear operative field for lymph node dissection. VATS-E in the prone position has achieved remarkable results in Japan.

PUVA is also useful to treat human platelet (PTL) concentrates in order to eliminate Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi. Both are parasites that cause Leishmaniosis (a dangerous skin and visceral disease) and Chagas disease, respectively; and may circulate in blood products collected from infected donors. We included in this study both lineal (psoralens) and angular (angelicins) furocoumarins. In the study, we grouped the LNs on two sets; set1: DNA–drug complex MD trajectories for active compounds and set2: MD trajectories of non-active compounds or no-optimal MD trajectories of active compounds. We calculated the respective π(k)(L) values for all these LNs and used them as inputs to train a new classifier that discriminate set1 from set2 cases. In training series the model correctly classifies 79 out of 80 (specificity = 98.75%) set1 and 226 out of 238 (Sensitivity = 94.96%) set2 trajectories. In independent validation series the model correctly classifies 26 out of 26 (specificity = 100%) set1 and 75 out of 78 (sensitivity = 96.15%) set2 trajectories. We propose this new model as a scoring function to guide DNA-docking studies in the drug design of new coumarins for anticancer or antiparasitic PUVA therapy.",2009-06-17,"Pérez-Montoto, Lázaro G.; Santana, Lourdes; González-Díaz, Humberto",Eur J Med Chem,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/41a2fae396348b8b2054a9e459861c56ee440d50.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7127518.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S022352340900333X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2009.06.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19604606/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S022352340900333X,35421011.0

METHODS The convenience sampling method was applied to select 422 medical workers who kept touch with the bereaved family members in five COVID-19 designated hospitals in Wuhan from January to February 2020. Questionnaire regarding grief counseling attitudes and questionnaire regarding grief counseling skills were used to evaluate the attitudes and skills of grief counseling in medical workers. The scores of grief counseling attitudes and skills in group of different characteristics were further compared. Pearson correlation was used to analyze the attitudes and skills of grief counseling in medical workers. RESULTS The scores of grief counseling attitudes in medical workers were 15-46 (33.00±9.31). Length of service, professional title, whether or not receiving relevant training, frequency of contact with bereaved family members contributed to impacting the medical workers' attitudes of grief counseling (all P<0.05). The scores of grief counseling skills in medical workers were 9-30 (19.30±4.42). Length of service, professional title, religion, whether or not receiving relevant training, frequency of contact with bereaved family members contributed to impacting the medical workers' skills of grief counseling (all P<0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between the attitudes and skills of grief counseling in the medical workers (r=0.608, P<0.01).

METHOD A prospective randomized controlled open label study was conducted on 75 breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly for 12 weeks. Eligible patients were randomized to either the low dose group; 1200 mg daily NAC, the high dose group; 1200 mg NAC twice daily or the control group; received paclitaxel only. The primary endpoint was the incidence of different grades of PIPN using National Cancer Institute's common toxicity criteria for adverse event (NCI-CTCAE) while secondary endpoints were the severity of PIPN using modified total neuropathy score (mTNS), quality of life (QOL) using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity (FACT-GOG-NTX) subscale, serum nerve growth factor (NGF), and serum malondialdehyde (MDA). RESULTS At the end of the 12-week period, the incidence of grade (2, 3) peripheral neuropathy was significantly lower in the high dose group (28.6%) compared to the low dose group (61.9%) and the control group (100%), p value < 0.001. A significant improvement in the mTNS and QOL scores was observed after 6 and 12 weeks in the high dose group and the low dose group compared to the control, p value < 0.001. Significantly higher levels of serum NGF in the high dose group and lower level of serum MDA in the high dose and the low dose group were observed. CONCLUSION Oral NAC (1200 mg once and twice daily) might reduce the incidence and severity of PIPN and improve the patients' QOL.

However, little is known about the presentation of patients with COVID-19 requiring emergency care, particularly those who used 911 emergency medical services (EMS). OBJECTIVE: To describe patient characteristics and prehospital presentation of patients with COVID-19 cared for by EMS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study included 124 patients who required 911 EMS care for COVID-19 in King County, Washington, a large metropolitan region covering 2300 square miles with 2.2 million residents in urban, suburban, and rural areas, between February 1, 2020, and March 18, 2020. EXPOSURES: COVID-19 was diagnosed by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 from nasopharyngeal swabs. Test results were available a median (interquartile range) of 5 (3-9) days after the EMS encounter. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of clinical characteristics, symptoms, examination signs, and EMS impression and care. RESULTS: Of the 775 confirmed COVID-19 cases in King County, EMS responded to 124 (16.0%), with a total of 147 unique 911 encounters. The mean (SD) age was 75.7 (13.2) years, 66 patients (53.2%) were women, 47 patients (37.9%) had 3 or more chronic health conditions, and 57 patients (46.0%) resided in a long-term care facility. Based on EMS evaluation, 43 of 147 encounters (29.3%) had no symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Based on individual examination findings, fever, tachypnea, or hypoxia were only present in a limited portion of cases, as follows: 43 of 84 encounters (51.2%), 42 of 131 (32.1%), and 60 of 112 (53.6%), respectively. Advanced care was typically not required, although in 24 encounters (16.3%), patients received care associated with aerosol-generating procedures. As of June 1, 2020, mortality among the study cohort was 52.4% (65 patients). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cohort study suggest that screening based on conventional COVID-19 symptoms or corresponding examination findings of febrile respiratory illness may not possess the necessary sensitivity for early diagnostic suspicion, at least in the prehospital emergency setting.

mk914rt2,,WHO,Prioritising access to pandemic influenza vaccine: a review of the ethics literature,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: The world is threatened by future pandemics. Vaccines can play a key role in preventing harm, but there will inevitably be shortages because there is no possibility of advance stockpiling. We therefore need some method of prioritising access. MAIN TEXT: This paper reports a critical interpretative review of the published literature that discusses ethical arguments used to justify how we could prioritise vaccine during an influenza pandemic. We found that the focus of the literature was often on proposing different groups as priorities (e.g. those with pre-existing health conditions, the young, the old, health care workers etc.). Different reasons were often suggested as a means of justifying such priority groupings (e.g. appeal to best overall outcomes, fairness, belonging to a vulnerable or 'at risk' group etc.). We suggest that much of the literature, wrongly, assumes that we are able to plan priority groups prior to the time of a particular pandemic and development of a particular vaccine. We also point out the surprising absence of various issues from the literature (e.g. how vaccines fit within overall pandemic planning, a lack of specificity about place, issues of global justice etc.). CONCLUSIONS: The literature proposes a wide range of ways to prioritise vaccines, focusing on different groups and 'principles'. Any plan to use pandemic vaccine must provide justifications for its prioritisation. The focus of this review was influenza pandemic vaccines, but lessons can be learnt for future allocations of coronavirus vaccine, if one becomes available.",2020,"Williams, Jane H; Dawson, Angus",BMC Med Ethics,,#762353,,,,,218640890.0

Infections caused by human coronaviruses (hCoVs) are mostly associated with the respiratory, enteric, and nervous systems. The hCoVs only occasionally induce lower respiratory tract disease, including bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. In 2002 to 2003, a global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the seminal detection of a novel CoV (SARS-CoV). A decade later (June 2012), another novel CoV was implicated as the cause of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Saudi Arabia. Although bats might serve as a reservoir of MERS-CoV, it is unlikely that they are the direct source for most human cases. Severe lines of evidence suggest that dromedary camels have been the major cause of transmission to humans. The emergence of MERS-CoV has triggered serious concerns about the potential for a widespread outbreak. All MERS cases were linked directly or indirectly to the Middle East region including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Oman, Kuwait, and UAE. MERS cases have also been reported in the later phases in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Tunisia. Most of these MERS cases were linked with the Middle East. The high mortality rates in family-based and hospital-based outbreaks were reported among patients with comorbidities such as diabetes and renal failure. MERS-CoV causes an acute, highly lethal pneumonia and renal dysfunction. The major complications reported in fatal cases are hyperkalemia with associated ventricular tachycardia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pericarditis, and multiorgan failure. The case-fatality rate seems to be higher for MERS-CoV (around 30%) than for SARS-CoV (9.6%). The combination regimen of type 1 interferon + lopinavir/ritonavir is considered as the first-line therapy for MERS. Antiviral treatment is generally recommended for 10 to 14 days in patients with MERS-CoV infection.

ProGrip™ is a self-gripping mesh which aims to reduce rates of chronic pain. The aim of this study is to perform an update meta-analysis to consolidate the non-superiority hypothesis in terms of postoperative pain and recurrence and perform a trial sequential analysis. METHODS Systematic review of randomised controlled trials performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Pooled odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) method. The primary outcome measure was postoperative pain and secondary outcomes were recurrence, operative time, wound complications, length of stay, re-operation rate, and cost. Trial sequential analysis was performed. RESULTS There were 14 studies included in the quantitative analysis with 3180 patients randomised to self-gripping mesh (1585) or standard mesh (1595). At all follow-up time points, there was no significant difference in the rates of chronic pain between the self-gripping and standard mesh (risk ratio, RR 1.10, 95% confidence interval, CI 0.83-1.46). There were no significant differences in recurrence rates (RR 1.13, CI 0.84-2.04). The mean operating time was significantly shorted in the ProGrip™ mesh group (MD - 7.32 min, CI - 10.21 to - 4.44). Trial sequential analysis suggests findings are conclusive.

They have different levels of tolerance to opioid effects which challenge the anesthesiologists in search of safe and effective opioid dosing perioperatively. The tested hypothesis is that simple measures introduced will allow us to measure tolerance qualitatively. Opioid effects on pain (analgesia) and dyspnea sensations (relieving effect) are tested. Patients were allocated to three groups according to pre-operative analgesics: (1) control, without any opioid analgesics, (2) weak opioid, and (3) strong opioid. Pressure pain threshold (PPT) and no-respiratory sensation period (NRSP) were measured at two points: before and 3 min after intravenous fentanyl administration. RESULTS A total of 58 (43 controls, 9 weak opioids, and 6 strong opioids) patients were enrolled. PPT and NRSP, after iv 2 μg/kg ideal body weight (IBW) fentanyl, were significantly elevated in the control patients (PPT: 6.2 ± 2.1 N to 9.2 ± 3.9 N, p < 0.0001, NRSP: 17.8 ± 10.8 s to 22.8 ± 18.7 s, p < 0.005, paired t test). However, preoperative opioid use, though with tendency, did not show a significant decrease of the opioid effect. Due to an insufficient number of participants, no conclusion could be drawn. Further analysis of the data from control patients showed a significant difference between the two sexes in sensitivity to PPT and NRSP, as well as fentanyl effect on PPT. CONCLUSIONS Current data showed a simple method of measuring the opioid effect on two dimensions: pain and respiration. Though not able to show a qualitative measurement of tolerance formation in opioid-users, data from control patients showed females to be more sensitive to pain and dyspnea but is less sensitive to the opioid effect. Further studies are necessary to show whether these gender differences serve as clinical relevance. TRIAL REGISTRATION UMIN, UMIN 000011580.

The magnitude of this problem is rising, jeopardizing the effectiveness of evidence-based therapies. An important reason for this is the unprecedented demographic change at the beginning of the 21st century. Aging leads to multimorbidity and complex therapeutic regimens that create a fertile ground for nonadherence. As this scenario is a global problem, it needs a worldwide answer. Could this answer be provided, given the new opportunities created by the digitization of health care? Daily, health-related information is being collected in electronic health records, pharmacy dispensing databases, health insurance systems, and national health system records. These big data repositories offer a unique chance to study adherence both retrospectively and prospectively at the population level, as well as its related factors. In order to make full use of this opportunity, there is a need to develop standardized measures of adherence, which can be applied globally to big data and will inform scientific research, clinical practice, and public health. These standardized measures may also enable a better understanding of the relationship between adherence and clinical outcomes, and allow for fair benchmarking of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adherence-targeting interventions. Unfortunately, despite this obvious need, such standards are still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to call for a consensus on global standards for measuring adherence with big data. More specifically, sound standards of formatting and analyzing big data are needed in order to assess, uniformly present, and compare patterns of medication adherence across studies. Wide use of these standards may improve adherence and make health care systems more effective and sustainable.",2020-08-27,"Kardas, Przemyslaw; Aguilar-Palacio, Isabel; Almada, Marta; Cahir, Caitriona; Costa, Elisio; Giardini, Anna; Malo, Sara; Massot Mesquida, Mireia; Menditto, Enrica; Midão, Luís; Parra-Calderón, Carlos Luis; Pepiol Salom, Enrique; Vrijens, Bernard",J Med Internet Res,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7484771.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7484771/,
h8hk135w,,WHO,Observational Study of Hydroxychloroquine in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine has been widely administered to patients with Covid-19 without robust evidence supporting its use. METHODS: We examined the association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death at a large medical center in New York City. Data were obtained regarding consecutive patients hospitalized with Covid-19, excluding those who were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department (study baseline). The primary end point was a composite of intubation or death in a time-to-event analysis. We compared outcomes in patients who received hydroxychloroquine with those in patients who did not, using a multivariable Cox model with inverse probability weighting according to the propensity score. RESULTS: Of 1446 consecutive patients, 70 patients were intubated, died, or discharged within 24 hours after presentation and were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 1376 patients, during a median follow-up of 22.5 days, 811 (58.9%) received hydroxychloroquine (600 mg twice on day 1, then 400 mg daily for a median of 5 days); 45.8% of the patients were treated within 24 hours after presentation to the emergency department, and 85.9% within 48 hours. Hydroxychloroquine-treated patients were more severely ill at baseline than those who did not receive hydroxychloroquine (median ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen, 223 vs. 360). Overall, 346 patients (25.1%) had a primary end-point event (180 patients were intubated, of whom 66 subsequently died, and 166 died without intubation). In the main analysis, there was no significant association between hydroxychloroquine use and intubation or death (hazard ratio, 1.04, 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.32). Results were similar in multiple sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In this observational study involving patients with Covid-19 who had been admitted to the hospital, hydroxychloroquine administration was not associated with either a greatly lowered or an increased risk of the composite end point of intubation or death. Randomized, controlled trials of hydroxychloroquine in patients with Covid-19 are needed.

Due to limited genomic and transcriptomic data, the biosynthetic pathway of glycyrrhizin, the major bioactive compound in G. uralensis, is currently unclear. Identification of candidate genes involved in the glycyrrhizin biosynthetic pathway will significantly contribute to the understanding of the biosynthetic and medicinal chemistry of this compound. RESULTS: We used the 454 GS FLX platform and Titanium regents to produce a substantial expressed sequence tag (EST) dataset from the vegetative organs of G. uralensis. A total of 59,219 ESTs with an average read length of 409 bp were generated. 454 ESTs were combined with the 50,666 G. uralensis ESTs in GenBank. The combined ESTs were assembled into 27,229 unique sequences (11,694 contigs and 15,535 singletons). A total of 20,437 unique gene elements representing approximately 10,000 independent transcripts were annotated using BLAST searches (e-value ≤ 1e-5) against the SwissProt, KEGG, TAIR, Nr and Nt databases. The assembled sequences were annotated with gene names and Gene Ontology (GO) terms. With respect to the genes related to glycyrrhizin metabolism, genes encoding 16 enzymes of the 18 total steps of the glycyrrhizin skeleton synthesis pathway were found. To identify novel genes that encode cytochrome P450 enzymes and glycosyltransferases, which are related to glycyrrhizin metabolism, a total of 125 and 172 unigenes were found to be homologous to cytochrome P450s and glycosyltransferases, respectively. The cytochrome P450 candidate genes were classified into 32 CYP families, while the glycosyltransferase candidate genes were classified into 45 categories by GO analysis. Finally, 3 cytochrome P450 enzymes and 6 glycosyltransferases were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in glycyrrhizin biosynthesis through an organ-specific expression pattern analysis based on real-time PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Using the 454 GS FLX platform and Titanium reagents, our study provides a high-quality EST database for G. uralensis. Based on the EST analysis, novel candidate genes related to the secondary metabolite pathway of glycyrrhizin, including novel genes encoding cytochrome P450s and glycosyltransferases, were found.

The model predicts the evolution of viral load, immune cells, cytokines, thrombosis, and oxygen saturation based on patient baseline condition and the presence of comorbidities. Model predictions were validated with clinical data from healthy people and COVID-19 patients, and the results were used to gain insight into identified risk factors of disease progression including older age; comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension; and dysregulated immune response. We then simulated treatment with various drug classes to identify optimal therapeutic protocols. We found that the outcome of any treatment depends on the sustained response rate of activated CD8(+) T cells and sufficient control of the innate immune response.

Since then, several diagnostic approaches have been re-adapted, and also improved from the previous detections of SARS and MERS coronavirus. The best strategy to handle this situation seems to rely on a triad of detection methods: (i) highly sensitive and specific techniques as the gold standard method, (ii) easier and faster point of care tests accessible for large population screening, and (iii) serology assays to complement the direct detection and to use for surveillance. In this study, we assessed the techniques and tests described in the literature, their advantages and disadvantages, and the interpretation of the results. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is undoubtedly the gold standard technique utilized not only for diagnostics, but also as a standard for comparison and validation of newer approaches. Other nucleic acid amplification methods have been shown to be adequate as point of care (POC) diagnostic tests with similar performance as RT-qPCR. The analysis of seroconversion with immunotests shows the complexity of the immune response to COVID-19.

Although antibody secreting cells (ASC) within the inflamed CNS have been extensively examined, memory B cell (Bmem) characterization has been limited as they do not secrete antibody without stimulation. Moreover, unlike human Bmem, reliable surface markers for murine Bmem remain elusive. NEW METHOD: Using a viral encephalomyelitis model we developed a modified limiting dilution in vitro stimulation assay to convert CNS-derived virus specific Bmem into ASC. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Stimulation methods established for lymphoid tissue cells using prolonged stimulation with viral lysate resulted in substantial ASC loss and minimal Bmem to ASC conversion of CNS-derived cells. By varying stimulation duration, TLR activators, and culture supplements, we achieved optimal conversion by culturing cells with TLR7/8 agonist R848 in the presence of feeder cells for 2 days. RESULTS: Flow cytometry markers CD38 and CD73 characterizing murine Bmem from lymphoid tissue showed more diverse expression patterns on corresponding CNS-derived B cell subsets. Using the optimized TLR7/8 stimulation protocol, we compared virus-specific IgG Bmem versus pre-existing ASC within the brain and spinal cord. Increasing Bmem frequencies during chronic infection mirrored kinetics of ASC. However, despite initially similar Bmem and ASC accumulation, Bmem prevailed in the brain, but were lower than ASC in the spinal cord during persistence.

COVID-19 was quickly designated as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization as there have been about 98.0 million confirmed cases and about 2.0 million confirmed deaths, as of January 2021. Although, our understanding of COVID-19 has significantly increased since its outbreak, and multiple treatment approaches and pharmacological interventions have been tested or are currently under development to mitigate its risk-factors. Recently, some vaccine candidates showed around 95% clinical efficacy, and now receiving emergency use approvals in different countries. US FDA recently approved BNT162 and mRNA-1273 vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Inc. for emergency use and vaccination in the USA. In this review, we present a succinct overview of the SARS-CoV-2 virus structure, molecular mechanisms of infection, COVID-19 epidemiology, diagnosis, and clinical manifestations. We also systematize different treatment strategies and clinical trials initiated after the pandemic outbreak, based on viral infection and replication mechanisms. Additionally, we reviewed the novel pharmacological intervention approaches and vaccine development strategies against COVID-19.

We have developed and present here an initial feasibility and safety study of transanal total mesorectal excision (TME) with splenic flexure release, high ligation of the IMA and IMV, and side-to-end coloanal anastomosis with temporary diverting ileostomy for rectal cancer. METHODS A program of full NOTES TME resection with release of the splenic flexure, high ligation of the IMA/IMV, with side-to-end coloanal anastomosis was performed transanally from December 2013 to July 2014. Demographics, preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative data were prospectively obtained. Operative components were broken into TME, colonic mobilization, splenic flexure release, IMA/IMV transection, transanal extraction of specimen, and coloanal anastomosis for analysis of performance completion. RESULTS There were 3 women and 1 man on whom we operated. Mean age was 56 (46-65). Mean BMI was 26 (23.8-30.2). The operation was completed entirely transanally in 2 patients. Transanal component completion of the operation was as follows: TME in 3/4; colonic mobilization in 4/4; splenic flexure release in 3/4; IMA/IMV transection in 3/4; transanal specimen extraction in 4/4; coloanal anastomosis in 4/4. Abdominal time for completion of component parts was: splenic flexure release 4:53 (min:s), IMA/IMV 19:43, completion of TME 13:41. Mean EBL was 194 cc (25-500). Aside from stoma site, there were no abdominal incisions. There were no mortalities. Mesorectum was intact in all 4 patients and with negative circumferential and distal margins. CONCLUSION This experience supports the feasibility and safety of a true NOTES TME. The critical anatomic views demonstrated on video affirm the potential of this approach for distal rectal cancer. Colorectal surgery represents the most logical application for NOTES. While highly promising, a great deal of work remains to develop the technique and applicability of NOTES colorectal surgery.",2016,"Marks, John H; Lopez-Acevedo, Nicolas; Krishnan, Barath; Johnson, Matthew N; Montenegro, Grace A; Marks, Gerald J",Surgical endoscopy,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4731-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26823054/,13199630.0

We describe clinical pictures, risk factors for death, and chances to recovery in a large cohort of KT recipients with COVID-19. METHODS: Inclusion in a Spanish prospectively filled registry was allowed for KT cases with confirmed COVID-19. Outcomes were assessed as in-hospital mortality or recovery. RESULTS: The study population comprised of 414 patients. Fever, respiratory symptoms, and dyspnea were the most frequent COVID-19-related symptoms, and 81.4% of them had pneumonia. More than one-third of patients showed digestive symptoms at diagnosis, combinations of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Most patients were hospitalized, 12.1% in intensive care units, and 17.6% needed ventilator support. Treatment for COVID-19 included frequently hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, high-dose steroids, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tocilizumab. After a mean follow-up of 44 days, the fatality rate was 26.3%. Pneumonia without gastrointestinal symptoms was associated with a 36.3% mortality (respiratory phenotype), and gastrointestinal symptoms without pneumonia with a 5.3% mortality (gastrointestinal phenotype). The mixed pneumonia and gastrointestinal phenotype showed an intermediate mortality of 19.5% (mixed phenotype). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that age and pneumonia were independently associated with death, whereas the gastrointestinal phenotype was associated with recovery.

Thailand is an important point of focus in terms of global pandemic preparedness and response due to its role as the major transportation hub for Southeast Asia, the endemic presence of multiple types of influenza, and its role as a major receiving country for migrants. Our aim was to collect information about vulnerable migrants’ perceptions of and ability to implement NPIs proposed by the WHO. We hope that this information will help us to gauge the capacity of this population to engage in pandemic preparedness and response efforts, and to identify potential barriers to NPI effectiveness. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was performed. The study was conducted during the influenza H1N1 2009 pandemic and included 801 migrant participants living in border areas thought to be high risk by the Thailand Ministry of Public Health. Data were collected by Migrant Community Health Workers using a 201-item interviewer-assisted questionnaire. Univariate descriptive analyses were conducted. RESULTS: With the exception of border measures, to which nearly all participants reported they would be adherent, attitudes towards recommended NPIs were generally negative or uncertain. Other potential barriers to NPI implementation include limited experience applying these interventions (e.g., using a thermometer, wearing a face mask) and inadequate hand washing and household disinfection practices. CONCLUSIONS: Negative or ambivalent attitudes towards NPIs combined with other barriers identified suggest that vulnerable migrants in Thailand have a limited capacity to participate in pandemic preparedness efforts. This limited capacity likely puts migrants at risk of propagating the spread of a pandemic virus. Coordinated risk communication and public education are potential strategies that may reduce barriers to individual NPI implementation.",2014-06-28,"Hickey, Jason; Gagnon, Anita J; Jitthai, Nigoon",BMC Public Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/403d1861771bf1e5e3625b0f86247d7134c3873d.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4090173.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-14-665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24973943/,6427030.0

We previously reported excellent outcomes with the abbreviated Stanford V regimen. Herein we report updated results with median follow-up >10 years on survival, therapy-related late effects, and impact of disease risk factors on patient outcomes. METHODS AND MATERIALS The XXXXXX and YYYYYY studies enrolled patients with stage I-IIA non-bulky ESHL. Patients received eight weeks of Stanford V chemotherapy followed by 30 Gy modified involved-field radiotherapy (mIFRT) (XXXXXX) or Stanford V-C + 20 Gy mIFRT (YYYYYY). Patients were categorized as favorable or unfavorable risk per German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) criteria and outcomes between groups compared. RESULTS 129 patients were enrolled (68 favorable and 61 unfavorable risk). In the XXXXXX study (n = 87), at median follow-up of 19.7 years, 5-, 10-, and 15-year PFS and OS were 95.4%/97.7%, 91.8%/96.5%, and 91.8%/95.3%, respectively. In the YYYYYY study (n = 42), at median follow-up of 13.5 years, the 5-, 10-, and 15-year PFS and OS were 92.9%/100%, 92.9%/100%, and 88.4%/91.9%, respectively. PFS (p = 0.86) and OS (p = 0.86) were not significantly different between studies. There were also no significant differences between studies in patients with favorable or unfavorable risk for PFS (F: p = 0.53; U: p = 0.96), OS (F: p = 0.99; U: p = 0.78), secondary malignancies (F: p = .74; U: p = 1.0), and cardiovascular complications (F: no cases; U: p = 1.0). CONCLUSIONS The XXXXXX and YYYYYY studies achieve high rates of durable remission. 20 versus 30 Gy mIFRT and cyclophosphamide substituted for mechlorethamine did not compromise nodal control, PFS, or OS in both favorable and unfavorable risk disease.

METHODS: We studied were 180 VLBW preterm infants who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of CHA Gangnam Hospital from January of 2006 to December of 2009. The subjects were divided into 2 groups: an NEC group (greater than stage II on the modified Bell's criteria) and a control group (less than stage II on the modified Bell's critieria). We defined red blood cell transfusion before NEC diagnosis as the frequency of transfusion until NEC diagnosis (mean day at NEC diagnosis, day 18) in the NEC group and the frequency of transfusion until 18 days after birth in the control group. RESULTS: Of the 180 subjects, 18 (10%) belonged to the NEC group, and 14 (78%) of these 18 patients had a history of transfusion before NEC diagnosis.

We have also observed increased serum CC16 levels in patients with renal dysfunction (RD). Therefore, the present study aimed to determine whether RD affects the diagnostic performance of CC16 for ARDS in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. METHODS We measured serum CC16 concentrations in 479 ICU patients, who were categorized into six groups according to their diagnoses: control, acute kidney injury (AKI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), ARDS, ARDS+AKI, and ARDS+CKD. The sensitivity, specificity, and cutoff values for serum CC16 were assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS Serum CC16 concentrations were higher in the ARDS group than in the control group, and in ARDS patients with normal renal function, serum CC16 could identify ARDS and predict survival outcomes at 7 and 28 days. However, serum CC16 levels were similar among the ARDS+AKI, ARDS+CKD, AIK, and CKD groups. Consequently, in patients with AKI and/or CKD, the specificity of CC16 for diagnosing ARDS or ARDS+RD decreased from 86.62 to 2.82% or 81.70 to 2.12%, respectively.

To our knowledge, no studies about their experiences regarding COVID-19 have been published. Present study aimed to describe the experiences of Otorhinolaryngologist during this pandemic. This is a qualitative study using an empirical phenomenological approach. 30 ENT doctors were recruited from government and private sector. They participated in semi-structured, in-depth interviews by telephone in a period of one month. Interviews were recorded by consent and data was analyzed. After analysis four themes were revealed namely; 'nature of duty during Covid-19 pandemic', 'modification made to adjust the duty', 'conflict between professional duty and family responsibilities', and 'fear of pandemic ill effect on their health'. The extreme work and fatigue drained ours ENT doctor's physically as well as emotionally. But our doctors showed their resilience and the spirit of professional dedication to overcome difficulties.

In our study, we designed the electrospun PCL patches with controlled architecture and topography for long-term release in time. Hemp oil shows anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, increasing also the skin moisture without clogging the pores. It can be used as an alternative cure for patients that do not respond to traditional treatments. In the study, we tested the mechanical properties of PCL fibers, and the hemp oil spreading together with the release in time measured on skin model and human skin. The PCL membranes are suitable material as patches or bandages, characterized by good mechanical properties and high permeability.

5yrcilop,,WHO,Biophysical analysis of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and theranostic development via N protein computational characterization,,,,unk,"Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as the causative factor of viral infection called COVID-19 that belongs to the zoonotic beta coronavirus family known to cause respiratory disorders or viral pneumonia, followed by an extensive attack on organs that express angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2). Human transmission of this virus occurs via respiratory droplets from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, which are released into the environment after sneezing or coughing. These droplets are capable of staying in the air as aerosols or surfaces and can be transmitted to persons through inhalation or contact with contaminated surfaces. Thus, there is an urgent need for advanced theranostic solutions to control the spread of COVID-19 infection. The development of such fit-for-purpose technologies hinges on a proper understanding of the transmission, incubation, and structural characteristics of the virus in the external environment and within the host. Hence, this article describes the development of an intrinsic model to describe the incubation characteristics of the virus under varying environmental factors. It also discusses on the evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 structural nucleocapsid protein properties via computational approaches to generate high-affinity binding probes for effective diagnosis and targeted treatment applications by specific targeting of viruses. In addition, this article provides useful insights on the transmission behavior of the virus and creates new opportunities for theranostics development.",2020,"Sabbih, Godfred O; Korsah, Maame A; Jeevanandam, Jaison; Danquah, Michael K",Biotechnol Prog,,#893205,,,,,226082135.0

We also examined the relationship between CT value and patient age to determine any age-dependent difference in viral load or test sensitivity. METHODS: We collected CT values obtained from the cobas severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) assay corresponding to 1,213 combined nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal specimens obtained from symptomatic individuals that were reported as positive or presumptive positive for SARS-CoV-2. CT values were stratified by SARS-CoV target and patient age group. RESULTS: In total, 93.3% to 98.4% of specimens demonstrated CT values greater than 3× the assay LoD, at which point false-negative results would not be expected. The mean of CT values between age groups was statistically equivalent with the exception of patients in age group 80 to 89 years, which demonstrated slightly lower CTs. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the distribution of observed CT values, including the small proportion of specimens with values near the assay LoD, there is a low risk of false-negative RT-PCR results in combined nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal specimens obtained from symptomatic individuals.",2020,"Buchan, Blake W; Hoff, Jessica S; Gmehlin, Cameron G; Perez, Adriana; Faron, Matthew L; Munoz-Price, L Silvia; Ledeboer, Nathan A",Am J Clin Pathol,,#656068,,,,,220655961.0

Methods Main clinical and operative data of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement between January 2010 and May 2016 were retrospectively collected. A total of 678 patients were treated with a standard full sternotomy approach, while MIAVR was performed in 502. Propensity score matching identified 363 patients per each group. Results In-hospital mortality was not significantly different between the propensity-matched groups (1.7% in MIAVR patients vs. 2.2% in conventional sternotomy patients; P=0.79). No significant difference in the incidence of major post-operative complications was observed. Post-operative ventilation times (median 7, range 5-12 hours in MIAVR patients vs. median 7, range 5-12 in conventional sternotomy patients; P=0.72) were not significantly different between the two groups.

High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was used to identify FCS constituents and to explore their effects on cultured cells evaluating secreted cytokines, eicosanoids, and other inflammatory mediators. Remarkably, the FCS eicosanoid composition showed more batch-dependent variations than the protein composition. Efficient uptake of fatty acids from the medium by U937 macrophages and inflammation-induced release thereof was evidenced using C13-labelled arachidonic acid, highlighting rapid lipid metabolism. For functional testing, FCS batch-dependent nanomolar concentration differences of two selected eicosanoids, 5-HETE and 15-HETE, were balanced out by spiking.

Their excellent antigen presentation potential can contribute to the activation of other cells of the immune system, and evidence is emerging that specialized subsets of these cells, that may be increased with age, can influence the cell-mediated immune system in antitumor responses. They can also regulate immune responses, to avoid autoreactivity and excessive inflammation. Deficiencies in regulatory B cells may be beneficial in cancer but will only exacerbate the inflammatory environment that is a hallmark of aging. The B cell role as antibody producers is particularly important, since antibodies perform numerous different functions in different environments. Although studying tissue responses in humans is not as easy as in mice, we do know that certain classes of antibodies are more suited to protecting the mucosal tissues (IgA) or responding to T-independent bacterial polysaccharide antigens (IgG(2)) so we can make some inference with respect to tissue-specific immunity from a study of peripheral blood. We can also make inferences about changes in B cell development with age by looking at the repertoire of different B cell populations to see how age affects the selection events that would normally occur to avoid autoreactivity, or increase specificity, to antigen.",2019-04-11,"Dunn-Walters, Deborah K.; O’Hare, Joselli Silva",Handbook of Immunosenescence,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/60a3c6f441aff320017f61160b124818112fd4e1.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121151.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121151/,

The study presents a comparison of the principal determinants of individual food insecurity in Europe and other Continents, with particular regard to gender, since the literature clearly states the importance of women in the administration of food in the household. The study of gender related differences in food insecurity is particularly important in Europe, since women experience food insecurity at a larger extent than men, but with a variability related to the geographical distribution and with complex relationships with economic and social drivers. Using a large international sample of individual level data, that allows the analysis for developed Countries for the first time, and the first experiential measure of food insecurity comparable at the global level, the paper analyses the principal determinants of gender differences in food insecurity. In order to verify if women’s vulnerability in food insecurity is moderated by specific factors, the modelling approach allows gender to vary by education, poverty, place of residence. The results suggest that the driver that could most mitigate women disadvantage is education: people with a university degree present a lower probability of experiencing food insecurity, both for men and for women.

Remarkably, this virus, known as Mimivirus, has a genome that encodes for nearly 1000 proteins, some of which are involved in the biosynthesis of unusual sugars. Indeed, the virus is coated by a layer of glycosylated fibers that contain d-glucose, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, l-rhamnose, and 4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-d-glucose. Here we describe a combined structural and enzymological investigation of the protein encoded by the open-reading frame L780, which corresponds to an l-rhamnose synthase. The structure of the L780/NADP+ /UDP-l-rhamnose ternary complex was determined to 1.45 Å resolution and refined to an overall R-factor of 19.9 %. Each subunit of the dimeric protein adopts a bilobal-shaped appearance with the N-terminal domain harboring the dinucleotide binding site and the C-terminal domain positioning the UDP-sugar into the active site. The overall molecular architecture of L780 places it into the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. Kinetic analyses indicate that the enzyme can function on either UDP- and dTDP-sugars but displays a higher catalytic efficiency with the UDP-linked substrate. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggest that both Cys 108 and Lys 175 play key roles in catalysis. This structure represents the first model of a viral UDP-l-rhamnose synthase and provides new details into these fascinating enzymes. This article is protected by copyright.

In order to solve the challenges posed by SILS cholecystectomy, an increasing number of techniques have been reported with the advent of new surgical instruments and refinements to existing technology. We describe, in this article, two new techniques that utilize existing instrumentations: an access and a retraction technique. METHODS A consecutive series of 23 selected patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis underwent SILS cholecystectomy from April 10, 2009 to August 12, 2009. The overall procedure was similar to SILS cholecystectomy described in the literature. Hovewer, the access technique, with small-size arthroscopy cannules, was used to overcome the technical difficulty resulting from the collision of large-size caps of the laparoscopy trocars, and the retraction technique with a tacker was used to suspend the fundus of the gallbladder without taking the risk of gallbladder perforation. RESULTS All patients were female, and the mean age was 34 years (range, 27-65). The body mass index of all patients was below 30 kg/m(2). The use of arthroscopy cannules provided a wider range of movement, and the retraction of the gallbladder was achieved safely with the tacker.

Compared with solution electrospinning (e-spinning), melt e-spinning is more bio-friendly without toxic solvent participation, which provides the possibility of in situ e-spinning on wounds directly. However, previously reported melt e-spinning devices were usually bulky and cumbersome due to their necessary heating unit, and different components were separated to avoid electrostatic interference. RESULTS: In this article, we report on a self-powered hand-held melt e-spinning gun which can work without any external power supply (outdoors). The problem of electrostatic interference for this integrated device was solved by using a special high heat transfer insulation unit. The apparatus is easy and safe to operate by a single hand due to its small volume (24 × 6 × 13 cm(3)) and light weight (about 450 g). Some biodegradable polymers, for example, polycaprolactone (PCL) fibers were successful e-spun onto wounds directly by using this dressing gun.

Open issues are discussed from two, apparently distant but complementary, points of view: micro-analytical devices, combining microfluidics with affinity bio-sensing, and gamma cameras for simultaneous multi-modal imaging, namely scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The role of integrated circuits is central in both application domains. In portable analytical platforms, ASICs offer miniaturization and tackle the noise/power dissipation trade-off. The integration of CMOS chips with microfluidics poses multiple open technological issues.

nwnkp2x5,,WHO,Communication Technology Preferences of Hospitalized and Institutionalized Frail Older Adults During COVID-19 Confinement: Cross-Sectional Survey Study,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Technological communication methods such as telephone calls and video calls can help prevent social isolation and loneliness in frail older adults during confinement. OBJECTIVE: Our objectives were to determine which virtual communication method (ie, telephone call or video call) was preferred by confined older hospital patients and nursing home residents and the variables influencing this preference. METHODS: The TOVID (Telephony Or Videophony for Isolated elDerly) study was a cross-sectional study that was designed to examine the preference between telephone calls and video calls among frail older adults who were either hospitalized in a geriatric acute care unit or institutionalized in a long-term care and nursing home during the COVID-19 confinement period. RESULTS: A total of 132 older people were surveyed between March 25 and May 11, 2020 (mean age 88.2 years, SD 6.2); 79 (59.8%) were women. Patients hospitalized in the geriatric acute care unit were more able to establish communication independently than residents institutionalized in the long-term care and nursing home (P=.03) and were more satisfied with their communication experiences (P=.02). Overall, older people tended to favor telephone calls (73/132, 55.3%) over video calls (59/132, 44.7%); however, their satisfaction degree was similar regardless of the chosen method (P=.1), with no effect of age (P=.97) or gender (P=.2). In the geriatric acute care unit, the satisfaction degrees were similar for telephone calls (40/41, 98%) and video calls (33/38, 87%) in older patients (P=.10). Conversely, in the long-term care and nursing home, residents were more satisfied with the use of video calls to communicate with their relatives (14/15, 93%) versus the use of telephone calls (6/12, 50%; P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Older people confined to health care settings were able to complete telephone calls more independently than video calls, and they tended to use telephone calls more often than video calls. The satisfaction degrees were similar with both modalities and even greater with video calls among long-term care and nursing home residents when they were given assistance to establish communication.

We describe and compare testing for SARS-CoV-2, test positivity and hospital admission, receipt of intensive care and mortality rates related to COVID-19 for people with a recent history of homelessness versus community-dwelling people as of July 31, 2020. METHODS We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada, between Jan. 23 and July 31, 2020, using linked health administrative data among people who either had a recent history of homelessness or were dwelling in the community. People were included if they were eligible for provincial health care coverage and not living in an institutionalized facility on Jan. 23, 2020. We examined testing for SARS-CoV-2, test positivity and complication outcomes of COVID-19 (hospital admission, admission to intensive care and death) within 21 days of a positive test result. Extended multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) in 3 time periods: preshutdown (Jan. 23-Mar. 13), peak (Mar. 14-June 16) and reopening (June 17-July 31). RESULTS People with a recent history of homelessness (n = 29 407) were more likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 in all 3 periods compared with community-dwelling people (n = 14 494 301) (preshutdown adjusted HR 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-2.11; peak adjusted HR 2.95, 95% CI 2.88-3.03; reopening adjusted HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.39-1.51). They were also more likely to have a positive test result (peak adjusted HR 3.66, 95% CI 3.22-4.16; reopening adjusted HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.15-2.71). In the peak period, people with a recent history of homelessness were over 20 times more likely to be admitted to hospital for COVID-19 (adjusted HR 20.35, 95% CI 16.23-25.53), over 10 times more likely to require intensive care for COVID-19 (adjusted HR 10.20, 95% CI 5.81-17.93) and over 5 times more likely to die within 21 days of their first positive test result (adjusted HR 5.73, 95% CI 3.01-10.91). INTERPRETATION In Ontario, people with a recent history of homelessness were significantly more likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2, to have a positive test result, to be admitted to hospital for COVID-19, to receive intensive care for COVID-19 and to die of COVID-19 compared with community-dwelling people.

We developed a panel of 17 neutralizing murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to further characterize the neutralization determinants of EAV. Included were 6 MAbs previously raised against a laboratory strain (EAVUCD) of the original Bucyrus strain of EAV, as well as 11 additional MAbs that were raised against a neutralization-resistant variant [escape mutant (EM)] virus (EM6D10) that was derived from EAVUCD. All MAbs raised against EAVUCD and 4 of the MAbs raised against EM6D10 (2B3, 5F8, 8D4, and 10B4) reacted with the corresponding G(L) envelope glycoprotein in a Western immunoblotting assay, whereas the remaining 7 MAbs raised against EM6D10 did not react with any viral protein in the immunoblotting assay but competitively inhibited the binding of MAbs 2B3, 5F8, 8D4, and 10B4, indicating that they also recognize epitopes on the G(L) protein. A panel of 18 EM viruses raised to the MAb panel, 19 field isolates of EAV from North America and Europe, the modified-live virus vaccine (ARVAC), and 3 other laboratory strains of EAV were characterized by microneutralization assay with the panel of neutralizing MAbs and polyclonal rabbit and horse antisera. Comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequences of ORF5 and the deduced amino acid sequences of the G(L) protein of individual EM viruses and field isolates of EAV identified four distinct neutralization sites. These sites include amino acids 49 (site A), 61 (site B), 67 through 90 (site C), and 99 through 106 (site D). With the notable exception of site A, the sites were all located in the V1 variable region (amino acids 61-121) within the second half of the N-terminal hydrophilic ectodomain of the G(L) protein.

We aimed to specify the radiological characteristics of COVID-19 and early lung cancer and to unveil the discrepancy between them. Methods One hundred and fifty-seven COVID-19 patients and 374 early lung cancer patients from four hospitals in China were retrospectively enrolled. Epidemiological, clinical, radiological, and pathological characteristics were compared between the two groups using propensity score-matched (PSM) analysis. Results COVID-19 patients had more distinct symptoms, tended to be younger (P<0.0001), male (P<0.0001), and had a higher body mass index (P=0.014). After 1:1 PSM, 121 matched pairs were identified. Regarding radiological characteristics, patients with a single lesion accounted for 17% in COVID-19 and 89% in lung cancer (P<0.0001). Most lesions were peripherally found in both groups. Lesions in COVID-19 involved more lobes (median 3.5 vs. 1; P<0.0001) and segments (median 6 vs. 1; P<0.0001) and tended to have multiple types (67%) with patchy form (54%).

Inverse weighted probability weighted analysis was performed to assess the effect of steroids for in-hospital mortality. The steroid group had higher rates of preexisting hypertension and peripheral vascular disease than no steroid group and also had higher lactate dehydrogenase, d-dimer, and inflammatory makers compared to no steroid group (all P<0.05). The steroid group had significantly higher rates of multifocal pneumonia than no steroid group at admission (75.4% versus 50.3%, P=0.001). Notably, steroid group had higher rates of bacterial infection (25% versus 13.1%, P=0.041) and fungal infection (12.7% versus 0.7%, P<0.001) during hospital course. After adjustment, steroid did not decrease or increase in-hospital mortality (OR [95% CI]: 1.02 [0.60-1.73, P=0.94]). Steroid did not decrease the in-hospital mortality rate. There were increased bacterial and fungal infections with steroid use.",2020-12-25,"Obata, Reiichiro; Maeda, Tetsuro; DO, Dahlia Rizk; Kuno, Toshiki",Japanese journal of infectious diseases,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.7883/yoken.jjid.2020.884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33390434/,229705913.0

This commentary provides guidance for employers to expand their DEI initiatives to include employee and family health and well-being as a central outcome measure. Employers should ensure that DEI efforts incorporate equitable benefits design, and objectively assess benefit design impact on healthcare utilization and cost. Additionally, employers must appreciate the workplace as a significant determinant of health-for lower income workers, in particular-with review of policies and practices to mitigate any discriminatory negative health or well-being impact. Further, race and ethnicity data should be incorporated in health benefits data analysis to understand more clearly the differential outcomes of health management offerings on these different sub-populations. Finally, social needs data should be incorporated into strategic benefits planning to better understand gaps and opportunities to foster greater benefits equity.

h49e30ej,,WHO,Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Children and Their Parents in Southwest Germany,,,,unk,"Importance: School and daycare closures were enforced as measures to confine the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, based on the assumption that young children may play a key role in severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread. Given the grave consequences of contact restrictions for children, a better understanding of their contribution to the COVID-19 pandemic is of great importance. Objective: To describe the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in children aged 1 to 10 years, compared with a corresponding parent of each child, in a population-based sample. Design, Setting, and Participants: This large-scale, multicenter, cross-sectional investigation (the COVID-19 BaWü study) enrolled children aged 1 to 10 years and a corresponding parent between April 22 and May 15, 2020, in southwest Germany. Exposures: Potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were infection and seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunofluorescence tests. Discordant results were clarified by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays, a second enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or an in-house Luminex-based assay. Results: This study included 4964 participants: 2482 children (median age, 6 [range, 1-10] years; 1265 boys [51.0%]) and 2482 parents (median age, 40 [range, 23-66] years; 615 men [24.8%]). Two participants (0.04%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The estimated SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence was low in parents (1.8% [95% CI, 1.2-2.4%]) and 3-fold lower in children (0.6% [95% CI, 0.3-1.0%]). Among 56 families with at least 1 child or parent with seropositivity, the combination of a parent with seropositivity and a corresponding child with seronegativity was 4.3 (95% CI, 1.19-15.52) times higher than the combination of a parent who was seronegative and a corresponding child with seropositivity. We observed virus-neutralizing activity for 66 of 70 IgG-positive serum samples (94.3%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection during a period of lockdown in southwest Germany was particularly low in children aged 1 to 10 years. Accordingly, it is unlikely that children have boosted the pandemic. This SARS-CoV-2 prevalence study, which appears to be the largest focusing on children, is instructive for how ad hoc mass testing provides the basis for rational political decision-making in a pandemic.",2021,"Tönshoff, Burkhard; Müller, Barbara; Elling, Roland; Renk, Hanna; Meissner, Peter; Hengel, Hartmut; Garbade, Sven F; Kieser, Meinhard; Jeltsch, Kathrin; Grulich-Henn, Jürgen; Euler, Julia; Stich, Maximilian; Chobanyan-Jürgens, Kristine; Zernickel, Maria; Janda, Ales; Wölfle, Lena; Stamminger, Thomas; Iftner, Thomas; Ganzenmueller, Tina; Schmitt, Christian; Görne, Tessa; Laketa, Vibor; Olberg, Sylvia; Plaszczyca, Anna; Cortese, Mirko; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Pape, Constantin; Remme, Roman; Huzly, Daniela; Panning, Marcus; Weigang, Sebastian; Giese, Sebastian; Ciminski, Kevin; Ankerhold, Jakob; Kochs, Georg; Schwemmle, Martin; Handgretinger, Rupert; Niemeyer, Charlotte M; Engel, Corinna; Kern, Winfried V; Hoffmann, Georg Friedrich; Franz, Axel R; Henneke, Philipp; Debatin, Klaus-Michael; Kräusslich, Hans-Georg",JAMA pediatr.

The enterprises employ the customization production paradigm, where the products have similar functions and structures, and adapt to such environment. However, for this mode, the mechanism is lack of making a quotation rapidly due to the complex of product and changeable demands. Formulating the relationship between factors and quotation of an order becomes an issue concerned by academia and entrepreneurs. We present control metrics to connect with those factors and existing quotation of a product. Since a quotation of product needs a large number of parameters to represent, the control metrics can be alternative of those parameters of quotation. Then, we propose a model of quoting. The correlation between the control metrics and a quotation of product is explored. Finally, a reduction approach of crucial metrics is developed by rough set on incomplete data. The case study is conducted to validate the performance of the proposed method of reduction. The outcomes show that the multiple reducts can be obtained to facilitate the enterprises to make viable quotation decision from the multiple schemes in terms of their characteristics and different demands of the customers.",2020-12-31,"Meng, Qiunan; Xu, Xun; Yang, Luwei",Procedia Manufacturing,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/fbf5197117c7d0aa29b045a31b12c4605412f6bd.json,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920314645; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920314645,219981728.0

The objective of this study was to determine differences in the growth of Staphylococcus aureus on nanomodified and unmodified polyvinyl chloride (PVC) ETTs under dynamic airway conditions simulating a ventilated patient. PVC ETTs were modified to have nanometer surface features by soaking them in Rhizopus arrhisus, a fungal lipase. Twenty-four-hour experiments (supported by computational models) showed that airflow conditions within the ETT influenced both the location and the concentration of bacterial growth on the ETTs, especially within areas of tube curvature. More importantly, experiments revealed a 1.5 log reduction in the total number of S. aureus on the novel nanomodified ETTs compared with the conventional ETTs after 24 hours of airflow. This dynamic study showed that lipase etching can create nanorough surface features on PVC ETTs that suppress S. aureus growth, and thus may provide clinicians with an effective and inexpensive tool to combat VAP.",2012,"Machado, Mary C; Tarquinio, Keiko M; Webster, Thomas J",International journal of nanomedicine,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s28191; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22904622/,7662008.0

It has been suggested that they affect each other. The aim of this study is to evaluate the association between clot burden score, thrombus perviousness, and collateral score and to determine whether collateral score influences the association of thrombus characteristics with functional outcome. METHODS Patients with baseline thin-slice noncontrast computed tomography and computed tomographic angiography images from the MR CLEAN trial (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands) were included (n=195). Collateral score and clot burden scores were determined on baseline computed tomographic angiography. Thrombus attenuation increase was determined by comparing thrombus density on noncontrast computed tomography and computed tomographic angiography using a semiautomated method. The association of collateral score with clot burden score and thrombus attenuation increase was evaluated with linear regression. Mediation and effect modification analyses were used to assess the influence of collateral score on the association of clot burden score and thrombus attenuation increase with functional outcome. RESULTS A higher clot burden score (B=0.063; 95% confidence interval, 0.008-0.118) and a higher thrombus attenuation increase (B=0.014; 95% confidence interval, 0.003-0.026) were associated with higher collateral score. Collateral score mediated the association of clot burden score with functional outcome. The association between thrombus attenuation increase and functional outcome was modified by the collateral score, and this association was stronger in patients with moderate and good collaterals. CONCLUSIONS Patients with lower thrombus burden and higher thrombus perviousness scores had higher collateral score. The positive effect of thrombus perviousness on clinical outcome was only present in patients with moderate and high collateral scores. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.trialregister.nl.

Neutrophils and monocyte-derived cells were recruited in infected mice 3-days post-infection. Compared to wild-type mice, there was an increased bacterial load in both these deficient mouse strains and an altered IIR, although TLR4(–/–) mice were more susceptible to bacterial infection. These mice also developed fewer alveolar macrophages, weaker neutrophil infiltration, less Ly6C(high) monocyte differentiation and a disrupted classical and non-classical monocyte profile. The pro-inflammatory cytokine profile (CXCL1, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) was also severely affected by the lack of TLR4 and no induction of Th1 was observed in these mice. The respiratory burst (ROS production) after infection was profoundly dampened in TLR4(–/–) and MyD88(–/–) mice.

Various health disciplines including physical therapists are still exploring the best way to manage this new disease. The role and involvement of physical therapists in the management of COVID-19 are not yet well defined and are limited in many hospitals. This article reports a physical therapy service specially commissioned by the Health Commission of Sichuan Province to manage COVID-19 during patients’ stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu in China. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were classified into 4 categories under a directive from the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China. Patients in the “severe” and “critical” categories were admitted to the ICU irrespective whether mechanical ventilation was required. Between January 31, 2020, and March 8, 2020, a cohort of 16 patients was admitted to the ICU at the Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu. The median (minimum to maximum) hospital and ICU stays for these patients were 27 (11–46) and 15 (6–38) days, respectively. Medical management included antiviral, immunoregulation and supportive treatment of associated comorbidities. Physical therapist interventions included body positioning, airway clearance techniques, oscillatory positive end-expiratory pressure, inspiratory muscle training, and mobility exercises. All patients had at least 1 comorbidity. Three of the 16 patients required mechanical ventilation and were excluded for outcome measures that required understanding of verbal instructions. In the remaining 13 patients, respiratory outcomes—including the Borg Dyspnea Scale, peak expiratory flow rate, Pao(2)/Fio(2) ratio, maximal inspiratory pressure, strength outcomes, Medical Research Council Sum Score, and functional outcomes (including the Physical Function in Intensive Care Test score, De Morton Mobility Index, and Modified Barthel Index)—were measured on the first day the patient received the physical therapist intervention and at discharge. RESULTS: At discharge from the ICU, while most outcome measures were near normal for the majority of the patients, 61% and 31% of these patients had peak expiratory flow rate and maximal inspiratory pressure below 80% of the predicted value and 46% had De Morton Mobility Index values below the normative value.

Lithium chloride, a widely prescribed drug for bipolar mood disorder, has been reported to possess anti-inflammatory properties. Using an intragastric infection model, the effects of LiCl on K. pneumoniae infections were examined. Providing mice with drinking water containing LiCl immediately after infection protected them from K. pneumoniae-induced death and liver injuries, such as necrosis of liver tissues, as well as increasing blood levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, in a dose-dependent manner. LiCl administered as late as 24 h postinfection still provided protection. Monitoring of the LiCl concentrations in the sera of K. pneumoniae-infected mice showed that approximately 0.33 mM LiCl was the most effective dose for protecting mice against infections, which is lower than the clinically toxic dose of LiCl. Surveys of bacterial counts and cytokine expression levels in LiCl-treated mice revealed that both were effectively inhibited in blood and liver tissues. Using in vitro assays, we found that LiCl (5 μM to 1 mM) did not directly interfere with the growth of K. pneumoniae but made K. pneumoniae cells lose the mucoid phenotype and become more susceptible to macrophage killing. Furthermore, low doses of LiCl also partially enhanced the bactericidal activity of macrophages.

We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bivalirudin compared with heparin plus a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPI) in patients with DM undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. We pooled patient-level data from the Randomized Evaluation of PCI Linking Angiomax to Reduced Clinical Events-2, Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage strategy, and Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction trials. The primary efficacy end point was the incidence of major adverse cardiac events, defined as the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or unplanned revascularization at 30 days. The primary safety end point was the incidence of 30-day non-coronary artery bypass graft-related major bleeding. All-cause mortality was reported at 30 days and 1 year. Of the 14,737 patients included in the pooled database, 3,641 (24.7%) had DM. Patients with DM had higher rates of 30-day major bleeding and 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality. There were no differences in 30-day major adverse cardiac events between bivalirudin versus heparin plus GPI in patients with DM (6.9% vs 7.8%; relative risk [RR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.12) or without DM (7.5% vs 6.7%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.27; pinteraction = 0.10).

Additionally, antiretroviral drugs have provided an effective means of protection against HIV transmission. Despite these advances, significant limitations exist; namely, the inability to eliminate HIV reservoirs, the inability to reverse lymphoid tissues damage, and the lack of an effective vaccine for preventing HIV transmission. Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of therapeutics and vaccines for eliminating HIV reservoirs and preventing HIV transmission requires robust in vivo models. Since HIV is a human-specific pathogen, that targets hematopoietic lineage cells and lymphoid tissues, in vivo animal models for HIV-host interactions require incorporation of human hematopoietic lineage cells and lymphoid tissues. In this review, we will discuss the construction of mouse models with human lymphoid tissues and/or hematopoietic lineage cells, termed, human immune system (HIS)-humanized mice. These HIS-humanized mouse models can support the development of functional human innate and adaptive immune cells, along with primary (thymus) and secondary (spleen) lymphoid tissues. We will discuss applications of HIS-humanized mouse models in evaluating the safety and efficacy of therapeutics against HIV reservoirs and associated immunopathology, and delineate the human immune response elicited by candidate HIV vaccines.

Both interrupted suture and continuous suture cannot overcome entanglement of the suture threads. The present study used the ""continuous suture dividing and equal suture tightening"" method in VATS sleeve lobectomy for bronchial anastomosis and discussed the feasibility of this approach. Methods A total of 17 patients underwent VATS sleeve lobectomy with bronchial anastomosis using the ""continuous suture dividing and equal suture tightening"" method. Four incisions were utilized in the operation as follows: (I) the pulmonary arteries and veins were cut-off using an endoscopic linear stapler. Systematic hilar and mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed; (II) the surgeon used a surgical knife for incision into the thoracic cavity and to cut the lung lobe and main bronchi. Intraoperative pathological analysis revealed negative bronchial margins; (III) the ""continuous suture dividing and equal suture tightening"" method was performed for anastomosis; (IV) the integrity of the anastomosis was assessed by intraoperative bronchoscopy. Computed tomography (CT), three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and bronchoscopy assessed the anastomosis 1-week postoperatively. A follow-up was conducted using a 3-month bronchoscopy, and CT scans monitored the recurrence and stenosis of the anastomosis. Results The method was successfully completed for VATS sleeve lobectomy with bronchial anastomosis in 17 cases. Although various histological profiles were observed, the 1-week postoperative CT and bronchoscopy showed adequate healing of the anastomotic stoma as well as the absence of postoperative mortality and bronchial pleural fistula. All patients were alive and followed up for 31-49 months postoperatively; local recurrence and anastomotic stenosis were not detected. Conclusions The continuous suture dividing and equal suture tightening method is convenient, feasible, and safe for bronchial anastomosis in VATS sleeve lobectomy.

The association of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins to liposomes potentially enhances the immunogenic effect of vaccine antigens by increasing their surface concentration. Furthermore, the introduction of a universal immunoglobulin-binding domain can make liposomes targetable to virtually any desired receptor for which antibodies exist. METHODS: We developed a system for the production of recombinant proteins with GPI anchors and histidine tags and Strep-tags for simplified purification from cells. This system was applied to i) the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter, ii) the promising Plasmodium falciparum vaccine antigen PfRH5 and iii) a doubled immunoglobulin Fc-binding domain termed ZZ from protein A of Staphylococcus aureus. As the GPI-attachment domain, the C-terminus of murine CD14 was used. After the recovery of these three recombinant proteins from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and association with liposomes, their vaccine potential and ability to target the CD4 receptor on lymphocytes in ex vivo conditions were tested. RESULTS: Upon immunization in mice, the PfRH5-GPI-loaded liposomes generated antibody titers of 10(3) to 10(4), and showed a 45% inhibitory effect on in vitro growth at an IgG concentration of 600 µg/mL in P. falciparum cultures. Using GPI-anchored ZZ to couple anti-CD4 antibodies to liposomes, we created immunoliposomes with a binding efficiency of 75% to CD4(+) cells in splenocytes and minimal off-target binding. CONCLUSIONS: Proteins are very effectively associated with liposomes via a GPI-anchor to form proteoliposome particles and these are useful for a variety of applications including vaccines and antibody-mediated targeting of liposomes. Importantly, the CHO-cell and GPI-tagged produced PfRH5 elicited invasion-blocking antibodies qualitatively comparable to other approaches.",2020-08-03,"Fotoran, Wesley L.; Kleiber, Nicole; Müntefering, Thomas; Liebau, Eva; Wunderlich, Gerhard",The journal of venomous animals and toxins including tropical diseases,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/58376de3c58553e7039fd0661151bacc9f1712c6.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7401668.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1590/1678-9199-jvatitd-2020-0032; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32788917/,221115892.0

It is known that Pneumonia Associated with Mechanical Ventilation (PAMV) is frequent in patients who use this equipment for a long time. As a consequence of COVID-19, its prolonged use can lead to a worse prognosis for the patients. For this reason, in addition to the insufficiency of devices for mechanical ventilation to meet the current demand, it is necessary to adopt measures aimed at preventing complications that may aggravate the patient's clinical condition and, consequently, increase the average hospital stay and the respective hospital care costs. Therefore, the objective of this study was to discuss, in a concise and practical way, and based on the available literature, the importance of adopting adequate oral hygiene protocols for patients on mechanical ventilation. Based on the data obtained, it was identified that the adoption of effective oral hygiene measures, especially under the supervision of dental professionals, can contribute to the reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with MV, resulting in greater availability of mechanical ventilation equipment. Since such equipment is in great demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, the knowledge and implementation of effective oral hygiene measures will undoubtedly have an impact on improving the quality of care offered to patients, therefore benefiting all those in critical health conditions and assisted in ICUs.",2020,"Silva, Dayane Helen Ferreira; Camargos, Júlia Hinkelmann de; Rodrigues, Jefferson Guimarães; Nogueira, Leilismara Sousa; Azevedo, Dênia Alves de; Carvalho, Maria das Graças; Pinheiro, Melina de Barros",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),,#950443,,,,,221864458.0

We constructed recombinant forms of the highly attenuated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) containing the gene encoding full-length SARS-CoV S with and without a C-terminal epitope tag called MVA/S-HA and MVA/S, respectively. Cells infected with MVA/Sor MVA/S-HA synthesized a 200-kDa protein, which was recognized by antibody raised against a synthetic peptide of SARS-CoV S or the epitope tag in Western blot analyses. Further studies indicated that S was N-glycosylated and migrated in SDS polyacrylamide gels with an apparent mass of approximately 160 kDa after treatment with peptide N-glycosidase F. The acquisition of resistance to endoglycosidase H indicated trafficking of S to the medial Golgi compartment, and confocal microscopy showed that S was transported to the cell surface. Intranasal or intramuscular inoculations of BALB/c mice with MVA/S produced serum antibodies that recognized the SARS S in ELISA and neutralized SARS-CoV in vitro. Moreover, MVA/S administered by either route elicited protective immunity, as shown by reduced titers of SARS-CoV in the upper and lower respiratory tracts of mice after challenge. Passive transfer of serum from mice immunized with MVA/S to naïve mice also reduced the replication of SARS-CoV in the respiratory tract after challenge, demonstrating a role for antibody to S in protection.

xjvxq0q8,,WHO,An empirical study on the determinants of health care expenses in emerging economies,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Emerging countries continue to suffer gravely from insufficient healthcare funding, which adversely affects access to quality healthcare and ultimately the health status of citizens. By using panel data from the World Development Indicators, the study examined the determinants of health care expenditure among twenty-two (22) emerging countries from the year 2000 to 2018. METHODS: The study employed cross-section dependence and homogeneity tests to confirm cross-sectional dependence and to deal with homogeneity issues. The Quantile regression technique is employed to test for the relationship between private and public health care expenses and its determinants. The Pooled mean group causality test is used to examine the causal connections among the variables. RESULTS: The outcome of the quantile regression test revealed that economic growth and aging population could induce healthcare costs in emerging countries. However, the impact of industrialization, agricultural activities, and technological advancement on health expenses are found to be noticeably heterogeneous at the various quantile levels. Unidirectional causality was found between industrialization and public health expenses; whereas two-way causal influence was reveled amongst public health expenditure and GDP per capita; public health expenditure and agricultural activities.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of filtered and nonfiltered HMEs placed between nebulizer and patient on aerosol deposition and airway resistance (Raw) in simulated ventilator-dependent adults. METHODS An in vitro lung model was developed to simulate a mechanically ventilated adult (Vt 500 mL, RR 15/min, and PEEP 5 cmH2O, using two inspiratory flow rates 40 and 50 L/min) using an intubated adult manikin with an endotracheal tube (8 mmID). The bronchi of the manikin were connected to a Y-adapter through a collecting filter (Respirgard II) attached to a test lung through a heated humidifier (37°C producing 100% relative humidity) to simulate exhaled humidity. For treatment conditions, a nonfiltered HME (ThermoFlo™ 6070; ARC Medical) and filtered HMEs (ThermoFlo™ Filter; ARC Medical and PALL Ultipor; Pall Medical) were placed between the ventilator circuit at the endotracheal tube and allowed to acclimate to the exhaled heat and humidity for 30 minutes before aerosol administration. Airway resistance (cmH2O/L/s) was taken at 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes after HME placement and after each of four aerosol treatments. Albuterol sulfate (2.5 mg/3 mL) was administered with jet (Misty Max 10; Airlife) and mesh (Aerogen Solo; Aerogen) nebulizers positioned in the inspiratory limb proximal to the Y-adapter. Control consisted of nebulization with no HME. Drug was eluted from filter at the end of the trachea and measured using spectrophotometry (276 nm). RESULTS Greater than 60% of the control dose was delivered through the ThermoFlo. No significant difference was found between the first four treatments given by the jet (p = 0.825) and the mesh (p = 0.753) nebulizers. There is a small increase in Raw between pre- and post-four treatments with the jet (p = 0.001) and mesh (p = 0.015) nebulizers. Aerosol delivery through filtered HMEs was similar (<0.5%) across the four treatments. Airway resistance was similar using the ThermoFlo Filter. With the PALL Ultipor, changes in Raw increased with mesh nebulizer after treatment (p = 0.005). Changes in resistance pre- and post-treatment were similar with both filtered HMEs. CONCLUSION The ThermoFlo™ nonfilter HME allowed the majority of the control dose to be delivered to the airway. Increases in Raw would likely not be outside of a tolerable range in ventilated patients. In contrast, filtered HMEs should not be placed between nebulizers and patient airways.

Videolaryngoscopes aim to ease ETI, but effort is still widely discussed. This study intended to investigate 2 different airway devices regarding the success rate of ETI during ongoing chest compressions. METHODS This randomized, cross-over, multi-center manikin trial included 85 experienced paramedics actively working in the emergency medicine service. After a standardized training session, all paramedics underwent 3 airway scenarios using both, direct laryngoscopy using a Macintosh blade and videolaryngoscope (the UEScope): normal airway without chest compressions, normal airway with uninterrupted chest compressions, and difficult airway with uninterrupted chest compressions. The primary outcome was successful ETI, defined as successful placement of the endotracheal tube within the manikin's trachea. Secondary outcomes were number of intubation attempts, time to successful ETI, time to best glottis view, best percent of glottic opening, best glottic view score (Cormack and Lehane), occurrence of dental trauma, ease of use, and willing to reuse in real-life situations. RESULTS The UEScope provided a better glottis visualization, and higher first pass intubation success rate compared to direct laryngoscopy in all 3 scenarios. The overall intubation success was higher, and the intubation time was shorter with the UEScope in scenario B and scenario C, but was comparable in scenario A. Dental compression occurred less often using the UEScope and paramedics rated intubation using the UEScope easier compared to direct laryngoscopy in all 3 airway scenarios. CONCLUSION In simulated CPR scenarios, intubation with the UEScope resulted in a better glottis visualization, a higher intubation success, and a shorter intubation time compared to Macintosh laryngoscope (MAC). Moreover, in situations where the airway is difficult for ETI especially by the paramedic, the UEScope would be a better choice than the MAC. Further studies are needed to confirm these results in real-life patients.",2018,"Szarpak, Lukasz; Madziala, Agnieszka; Czekajlo, Michael; Smereka, Jacek; Kaserer, Alexander; Dabrowski, Marek; Madziala, Marcin; Yakubtsevich, Ruslan; Ladny, Jerzy Robert; Ruetzler, Kurt",Medicine,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000012085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30200089/,52181164.0

Historically, clinicians and researchers have always been interested in quantifying and characterizing those effects through recordings of surface brain electrical activity, namely electroencephalography (EEG). Over decades of research, the complex signal has been dissected to extract its core substance, with significant advances in the interpretation of the information it may contain. Methodological, engineering, statistical, mathematical, and computer progress now furnishes advanced tools that not only allow quantification of the effects of anesthesia, but also shed light on some aspects of anesthetic mechanisms. In this article, we will review how advanced EEG serves the anesthesiologist in that respect, but will not review other intraoperative utilities that have no direct relationship with consciousness, such as monitoring of brain and spinal cord integrity. We will start with a reminder of anesthestic effects on raw EEG and its time and frequency domain components, as well as a summary of the EEG analysis techniques of use for the anesthesiologist. This will introduce the description of the use of EEG to assess the depth of the hypnotic and anti-nociceptive components of anesthesia, and its clinical utility. The last part will describe the use of EEG for the understanding of mechanisms of anesthesia-induced alteration of consciousness. We will see how, eventually in association with transcranial magnetic stimulation, it allows exploring functional cerebral networks during anesthesia.

Digital health interventions, that include modalities such as internet, smart phones, and monitoring sensors, may help increase rural residents' access to healthcare. While digital health interventions have become an increasingly popular intervention strategy to address obesity, research examining the use of technological tools for obesity management among rural Latino populations is limited. In this paper, we share our experience developing a culturally tailored, interactive health intervention using digital technologies for a family-oriented, weight management program in a rural, primarily Latino community. We describe the formative research that guided the development of the intervention, discuss the process of developing the intervention technologies including issues of privacy and data security, examine the results of a pilot study, and share lessons learned. Our experience can help others design user-centered digital health interventions to engage underserved populations in the uptake of healthy lifestyle and disease management skills.

In this study, our molecular dynamics simulation and protein surface plasmon resonance cohesively proved the SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 binding was less affinitive and stable under 40°C (∼18 nM) than the optimum temperature 37°C (6.2nM), while SARS-CoV-ACE2 binding was not (6.4nM vs. 8.5nM), which evidenced the temperature-dependent affinity and explained that higher temperature is related to better clinical outcome. The decreased infection at higher temperature was also validated by pseudovirus entry assay using Vero and Caco-2 cells. We also demonstrated the structural basis of the distinct temperature-dependence of the two coronaviruses. Furthermore, the meta-analysis revealed a milder inflammatory response happened in the early stage of COVID-19, which explained the low fever tendency of COVID-19 and indicated the co-evolution of the viral protein structure and the inflammatory response.

Currently, only symptomatic relief has been provided by FDA-approved therapeutic approaches for Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aims to evaluate the potential of wedelolactone (WDL), a natural occurring coumestan found in Eclipta alba to mitigate the parkinsonism in Caenorhabditis elegans disease model. In the present studies, supplementation with 37.5 µM WDL exhibited a reduction in the level of &#945;-syn in an age-dependent manner (22% at day 5, p < 0.05; and 16% at day 10, p < 0.001, n = 30), along with improvement in neuronal health through basal movement, and elevated the dopamine levels evident through 1-nonanol repulsion results in wild-type and diseased worms. Moreover, WDL augmented the mitochondrial health in wild-type, PD-diseased, and mev-1 mutant worms that establish the inherent activity of WDL in the alleviation of oxidative stress. Furthermore, WDL supplementation significantly decreases the neutral lipid and triglyceride level and also alleviates protein carbonyl level in PD disease condition. The overall investigation will provide a pioneer to the future insights of PD research related to plant-based drugs. qPCR studies after WDL supplementation revealed alteration of genes involved in the regulation of various stress-responsive (sod-5, gst-4, skn-1), &#945;-syn-suppressing (lrk-1, ymel-1, lagr-1, grk-1), and mitochondrial (pink-1) genes.

This study was performed with: (i) a positive panel constituted of 88 SARS-CoV-2 specimens collected from patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, and (ii) a negative panel of 120 serum samples, all collected before November 2019, including 64 samples with a cross-reactivity panel. Sensitivity of Covid-Presto® test for IgM and IgG was 78.4% and 92.0%, respectively. Sensitivity of NG-Test® for IgM and IgG was 96.6% and 94.9%, respectively. Sensitivity of Abbott IgG assay was 96.5% showing an excellent agreement with the two rapid tests (&#954; = 0.947 and &#954; = 0.936 for NGTest ® and Covid-Presto® test, respectively). An excellent agreement was also observed between the two rapid tests (&#954; = 0.937). Specificity for IgM was 100% and 86.5% for Covid-Presto® test and NG-Test®, respectively. Specificity for IgG was 92.0%, 94.9% and 96.5% for Covid-Presto®, NGTest ®, and Abbott, respectively. Most of the false positive results observed with NG-Test® resulted from samples containing malarial antibodies. In conclusion, performances of these 2 rapid tests are very good and comparable to those obtained with automated immunoassay, except for IgM specificity with the NG-Test®. Thus, isolated IgM should be cautiously interpreted due to the possible false-positive reactions with this test.

The mitochondrial adaptor molecule MAVS plays critical roles in coordinating both virus-induced type I interferon production and apoptosis; however, the regulation of MAVS-mediated apoptosis is poorly understood. Here, we show that the adaptor protein TAX1BP1 functions as a negative regulator of virus-induced apoptosis. TAX1BP1-deficient cells are highly sensitive to apoptosis in response to infection with the RNA viruses vesicular stomatitis virus and Sendai virus and to transfection with poly(I·C). TAX1BP1 undergoes degradation during RNA virus infection, and loss of TAX1BP1 is associated with apoptotic cell death. TAX1BP1 deficiency augments virus-induced activation of proapoptotic c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling. Virus infection promotes the mitochondrial localization of TAX1BP1 and concomitant interaction with the mitochondrial adaptor MAVS. TAX1BP1 recruits the E3 ligase Itch to MAVS to trigger its ubiquitination and degradation, and loss of TAX1BP1 or Itch results in increased MAVS protein expression. Together, these results indicate that TAX1BP1 functions as an adaptor molecule for Itch to target MAVS during RNA virus infection and thus restrict virus-induced apoptosis.",2017,"Choi, Young Bong; Shembade, Noula; Parvatiyar, Kislay; Balachandran, Siddharth; Harhaj, Edward William",Molecular and cellular biology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1128/mcb.00422-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27736772/,38285548.0

We evaluated whether adding myocardial blush grade (MBG) and quantitative reperfusion ventricular arrhythmia ""bursts"" (VABs) surrogates provide a more informative biosignature of optimal reperfusion in patients with Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 3 flow and ST-segment recovery (STR). METHODS AND RESULTS Anterior STEMI patients with final TIMI 3 flow had protocol-blinded analyses of simultaneous MBG, continuous 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) STR, Holter VABs, and day 5-14 SPECT imaging infarct size (IS) assessments. Over 20 million cardiac cycles from >4500 h of continuous ECG monitoring in subjects with STR were obtained. IS and clinical outcomes were examined in patients stratified by MBG and VABs. VABs occurred in 51% (79/154) of subjects. Microcirculation (MBG 2/3) was restored in 75% (115/154) of subjects, of whom 53% (61/115) had VABs. No VABs were observed in subjects without microvascular flow (MBG of 0). Of 115 patients with TIMI 3 flow, STR, and MBG 2/3, those with VABs had significantly larger IS (median: 23.0% vs 6.0%, p=0.001). Multivariable analysis identified reperfusion VABs as a factor significantly associated with larger IS (p=0.015). CONCLUSIONS Despite restoration of normal epicardial flow, open microcirculation, and STR, concomitant VABs are associated with larger myocardial IS, possibly reflecting myocellular injury in reperfusion settings.

METHODS This article is based on an invited lecture by the first author at a conference-the eHealth Summit (""Pediatric Rehabilitation in a Digital Space"")-organized by the other authors and their colleagues in May 2020. RESULTS The first author offers his own experiences and perspectives, supplemented by comments and observations contributed by many of the 9000+ attendees at this talk, as curated by the second and third authors. The basic messages are that while life for families of children with developmental disabilities, and for service providers who work with them, is significantly altered, many important lessons are being learned. CONCLUSIONS The comments from participants support the currency of the ideas that were presented, and encourage childhood disability professionals to reflect on what we are learning, so that we can seize the opportunities they afford to do things differently-and we believe better-moving forward. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION Ideas generated by colleagues and parents suggest that there may be alternatives to ""business as usual"" in childhood disability services after the COVID pandemic is over. People are recognizing opportunities, and benefits, to offering services virtually, including being able to see children in their natural environments, saving parents time, money and hassles to attend clinics in person, and perhaps increasing the availability of services. Many issues remain to be investigated systematically, including, among others, what services (assessments and interventions) require hands-on connections, what payment structures can accommodate new models of services, how professionals can work together in a virtual world, and what families will want. Regardless of the final answers to these issues, we believe that we should not simply ""go back to normal""; rather, we should expand the range, nature and locations of our services for children with developmental disabilities and their families.",2020-12-23,"Rosenbaum, Peter L; Silva, Mindy; Camden, Chantal",Disability and rehabilitation,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2020.1862925; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33355010/,229691084.0

In parallel, it is of high importance to actively avoid cessation of innovation in order not to endanger the continuous improvement in prognosis of cancer patients. This includes sustained conduction of clinical trials as well as ongoing translational research. Here, we describe measures taken at the University Cancer Center Hamburg (UCCH) − a recognized comprehensive oncology center of excellence − during the COVID-19 crisis.

05j900eo,,WHO,Identification of SARS-CoV-2 Cell Entry Inhibitors by Drug Repurposing Using in silico Structure-Based Virtual Screening Approach,,,,unk,"The rapidly spreading, highly contagious and pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) associated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The novel 2019 SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell by binding of the viral surface spike glycoprotein (S-protein) to cellular angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. The virus specific molecular interaction with the host cell represents a promising therapeutic target for identifying SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs. The repurposing of drugs can provide a rapid and potential cure toward exponentially expanding COVID-19. Thereto, high throughput virtual screening approach was used to investigate FDA approved LOPAC library drugs against both the receptor binding domain of spike protein (S-RBD) and ACE2 host cell receptor. Primary screening identified a few promising molecules for both the targets, which were further analyzed in details by their binding energy, binding modes through molecular docking, dynamics and simulations. Evidently, GR 127935 hydrochloride hydrate, GNF-5, RS504393, TNP, and eptifibatide acetate were found binding to virus binding motifs of ACE2 receptor. Additionally, KT203, BMS195614, KT185, RS504393, and GSK1838705A were identified to bind at the receptor binding site on the viral S-protein. These identified molecules may effectively assist in controlling the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 by not only potentially inhibiting the virus at entry step but are also hypothesized to act as anti-inflammatory agents, which could impart relief in lung inflammation. Timely identification and determination of an effective drug to combat and tranquilize the COVID-19 global crisis is the utmost need of hour. Further, prompt in vivo testing to validate the anti-SARS-CoV-2 inhibition efficiency by these molecules could save lives is justified.",2020,"Choudhary, Shweta; Malik, Yashpal S; Tomar, Shailly",Front Immunol,,#724205,,,,,220429778.0

However, the mechanism by which TBI causes ALI/ARDS is not fully understood. Here we used a severe TBI model to examine the effects of a low-molecular-weight heparin, Enoxaparin on inflammasome activation and lung injury damage. We investigated whether Enoxaparin inhibits ALI and inflammasome signaling protein expression in the brain and lungs after TBI in mice. C57/BL6 mice were subjected to severe TBI and were treated with vehicle or 1 mg/kg Enoxaparin 30 minutes after injury. Lung and brain tissue were collected 24 hours post-TBI and were analyzed by immunoblotting for the expression of the inflammasome proteins caspase-1 and IL-1. In addition, lung tissue was collected for histological analysis to determine ALI scoring and neutrophil and macrophage infiltration post-injury. Our data show that severe TBI induces increased expression of inflammasome proteins caspase-1 and IL-1 in the brain and lungs of mice after injury. Treatment with enoxaparin attenuated inflammasome expression in the brain and lungs 24 hours after injury. Enoxaparin significantly decreased the ALI score as well as neutrophil and macrophage infiltration in the lungs at 24 hours after injury. This study demonstrates that Enoxaparin attenuates ALI and inhibits inflammasome expression in the brain and lungs after TBI. These findings support the hypothesis that inhibition of the neural-respiratory inflammasome axis that is activated following TBI may have therapeutic potential.",2020-07-15,"Kerr, Nadine; De Rivero Vaccari, Juan Pablo; Weaver, Cailey; Dietrich, W Dalton; Ahmed, Tahir; Keane, Robert W",Journal of neurotrauma,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1089/neu.2020.7257; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32669032/,220582891.0

However, literature demonstrating the efficacy of the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended handwashing procedure among schoolchildren in India is scanty. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess hand hygiene efficacy through graphical assessment technique utilizing ultraviolet (UV)-sensitive fluorescent lotion before and after handwashing demonstration among students aged 12–18 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an interventional study carried out over a period of 5 days among 21 schoolchildren aged 12–18 years in their respective school premises. Participants were requested to rub their hands with an UV-sensitive fluorescent lotion and then wash them. Hands were air-dried and examined under UV rays for blue light emission in a dark room. Emission of blue light highlighted parts of hand where lotion is still present and area not washed properly. Such areas were painted with nontoxic skin-friendly paints. Painted hands were imprinted over graph papers. Hand hygiene demonstration was provided to the participants as per the WHO guidelines by qualified public health dentists using audiovisual aids. Postintervention, the procedure followed at baseline was adopted to obtain imprints of uncovered (not covered during hand hygiene process) parts of hands. The mean percentage of uncovered parts of hand was assessed and compared between baseline and postintervention. RESULTS: The overall mean percentage score of uncovered hand area significantly reduced from 73.90 ± 19.81 mm(2) at baseline to 20.05 ± 17.0 mm(2) after demonstration of proper hand hygiene guidelines (P < 0.001).

crp0llfv,,WHO,A Positive-Pressure Environment Disposable Shield (PEDS) for COVID-19 Health Care Worker Protection,,,,unk,"The COVID-19 pandemic has strained health care system resources and reduced the availability of life-sustaining and medical-grade personal protective equipment (PPE) though the combination of increased demand and disrupted manufacturing supply chains. As a result of these shortages, many health care providers have temporarily used largely untested, improvised PPE (iPPE). Lack of quality control for makeshift PPE and frequent repurposing of used items to conserve supplies increase both the risk of provider infection and nosocomial spread to uninfected patients. One strategy to reduce risk of infection and preserve existing equipment is the implementation of secondary barrier devices placed directly over patients or providers. The authors describe an inexpensive, disposable, positive-pressure head isolation unit that can be rapidly constructed from materials readily available in nearly all health care settings for under five US dollars. The unit was successfully deployed in Taiwan during the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, and again during the COVID-19 pandemic. The iPPE worn directly by the health care workers (HCWs) can be donned prior to patient contact in the presence of an air source. This strategy may be more protective than a covering placed over the patient in an aerosol-generating environment, which requires the HCW to be in close contact with the patient prior to securing the protective device.",2020,"Chien, Li-Chien; Beÿ, Christian K; Koenig, Kristi L",Prehosp Disaster Med,,#244550,,,,,218619893.0

This viral coagulopathy may occur despite thromboprophylaxis and raises mortality; the risk appears highest among critically ill inpatients monitored in the intensive care unit. The prevalence of venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients has been reported to reach ∼10-35%, while autopsies raise it to nearly 60%. The most common thrombotic complication is pulmonary embolism, which though may occur in the absence of a recognizable deep venous thrombosis and may be due to pulmonary arterial thrombosis rather than embolism, resulting in thrombotic occlusion of small- to mid-sized pulmonary arteries and subsequent infarction of lung parenchyma. This micro-thrombotic pattern seems more specific for COVID-19 and is associated with an intense immuno-inflammatory reaction that results in diffuse occlusive thrombotic micro-angiopathy with alveolar damage and vascular angiogenesis. Furthermore, thrombosis has also been observed in various arterial sites, including coronary, cerebral and peripheral arteries. Biomarkers related to coagulation, platelet activation and inflammation have been suggested as useful diagnostic and prognostic tools for COVID-19-associated coagulopathy; among them, D-dimer remains a key biomarker employed in clinical practice.

We conducted a randomized controlled trial of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) compared with POC in a non–intensive care unit (ICU) hospital setting. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 110 adults with type 2 diabetes on a non-ICU floor received RT-CGM with Dexcom G6 versus usual care (UC). RT-CGM data were wirelessly transmitted from the bedside. Hospital telemetry monitored RT-CGM data and notified bedside nursing of glucose alerts and trends. Standardized protocols were used for interventions. RESULTS: The RT-CGM group demonstrated significantly lower mean glucose (M∆ = −18.5 mg/dL) and percentage of time in hyperglycemia >250 mg/dL (−11.41%) and higher time in range 70–250 mg/dL (+11.26%) compared with UC (P values <0.05).

METHODS A self-designed questionnaire was used to conduct an online survey for 4 139 Hunan residents. The contents included general population information, residents' knowledge, attitude and practice to COVID-19. RESULTS Mean scores of knowledge, attitude, and behavior were 29.82±3.16, 6.71±1.12, and 14.93±1.45, respectively. Residents had the highest score of major symptoms of COVID-19 (3.96±0.39), but the lowest was the main transmission routes (3.47±0.89). A total of 22.68% of the residents were very or relatively afraid of the outbreak, but 95.22% of the residents had confidence in defeating COVID-19. In behavior dimension, ""handling of suspicious symptoms"" had the lowest score (3.58±0.75).

In mammalian cells, stress signaling usually leads to either cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis, depending on the severity of the insult and the ability of the cell to recover. Stress also often leads to reorganization of nuclear architecture, reflecting the simultaneous inhibition of major nuclear pathways (e.g., replication and transcription) and activation of specific stress responses (e.g., DNA repair). In this review, we focus on how two nuclear organelles, the nucleolus and the Cajal body, respond to stress. The nucleolus senses stress and is a central hub for coordinating the stress response. We review nucleolar function in the stress-induced regulation of p53 and the specific changes in nucleolar morphology and composition that occur upon stress.

gpv9zcao,,WHO,Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2: SARS-CoV-2 Receptor and Regulator of the Renin-Angiotensin System: Celebrating the 20th Anniversary of the Discovery of ACE2,,,,unk,"ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) has a multiplicity of physiological roles that revolve around its trivalent function: a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system, facilitator of amino acid transport, and the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 receptor. ACE2 is widely expressed, including, in the lungs, cardiovascular system, gut, kidneys, central nervous system, and adipose tissue. ACE2 has recently been identified as the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the infective agent responsible for coronavirus disease 2019, providing a critical link between immunity, inflammation, ACE2, and cardiovascular disease. Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2. The loss of ACE2 function following binding by SARS-CoV-2 is driven by endocytosis and activation of proteolytic cleavage and processing. The ACE2 system is a critical protective pathway against heart failure with reduced and preserved ejection fraction including, myocardial infarction and hypertension, and against lung disease and diabetes mellitus. The control of gut dysbiosis and vascular permeability by ACE2 has emerged as an essential mechanism of pulmonary hypertension and diabetic cardiovascular complications. Recombinant ACE2, gene-delivery of Ace2, Ang 1-7 analogs, and Mas receptor agonists enhance ACE2 action and serve as potential therapies for disease conditions associated with an activated renin-angiotensin system. rhACE2 (recombinant human ACE2) has completed clinical trials and efficiently lowered or increased plasma angiotensin II and angiotensin 1-7 levels, respectively.

4o7xe0jb,,WHO,Weakly labeled data augmentation for deep learning: A study on COVID-19 detection in chest X-rays,,,,unk,"The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic resulting in over 2.7 million infected individuals and over 190,000 deaths and growing. Assertions in the literature suggest that respiratory disorders due to COVID-19 commonly present with pneumonia-like symptoms which are radiologically confirmed as opacities. Radiology serves as an adjunct to the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test for confirmation and evaluating disease progression. While computed tomography (CT) imaging is more specific than chest X-rays (CXR), its use is limited due to cross-contamination concerns. CXR imaging is commonly used in high-demand situations, placing a significant burden on radiology services. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has been suggested to alleviate this burden. However, there is a dearth of sufficient training data for developing image-based AI tools. We propose increasing training data for recognizing COVID-19 pneumonia opacities using weakly labeled data augmentation. This follows from a hypothesis that the COVID-19 manifestation would be similar to that caused by other viral pathogens affecting the lungs. We expand the training data distribution for supervised learning through the use of weakly labeled CXR images, automatically pooled from publicly available pneumonia datasets, to classify them into those with bacterial or viral pneumonia opacities. Next, we use these selected images in a stage-wise, strategic approach to train convolutional neural network-based algorithms and compare against those trained with nonaugmented data. Weakly labeled data augmentation expands the learned feature space in an attempt to encompass variability in unseen test distributions, enhance inter-class discrimination, and reduce the generalization error. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that simple weakly labeled data augmentation (Acc: 0.5555 and Acc: 0.6536) is better than baseline non-augmented training (Acc: 0.2885 and Acc: 0.5028) in identifying COVID-19 manifestations as viral pneumonia. Interestingly, adding COVID-19 CXRs to simple weakly labeled augmented training data significantly improves the performance (Acc: 0.7095 and Acc: 0.8889), suggesting that COVID-19, though viral in origin, creates a uniquely different presentation in CXRs compared with other viral pneumonia manifestations.",2020,"Rajaraman, Sivaramakrishnan; Antani, Sameer",Diagn.,,#436377,,,,,219285075.0

Determining the status of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in both candidates and recipients will be important to understand the epidemiology and clinical course of COVID-19 in this population. While there are multiple tests to detect antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, their performance is variable. Tests vary according to their platforms and the antigenic targets which make interpretation of the results challenging. Furthermore, for some assays, sensitivity and specificity is less than optimal. Additionally, currently available serological tests do not exclude the possibility that positive responses are due to cross reactive antibodies to community coronaviruses rather than SARS-CoV-2. METHODS This study describes the development and validation of a high throughput multiplex antibody detection assay. RESULTS The multiplex assay has the capacity to identify, simultaneously, patient responses to 5 SARS-CoV-2 proteins, namely, the full spike protein, 3 individual domains of the spike protein (S1, S2 and receptor binding domain) and the nucleocapsid protein. The antibody response to the above proteins are SARS-CoV-2 specific, as antibodies against 4 common coronaviruses do not cross-react. CONCLUSIONS This new assay provides a novel tool to interrogate the spectrum of immune responses to SAR-CoV-2 and is uniquely suitable for use in the transplant setting. Test configuration is essentially identical to the single antigen bead assays used in the majority of histocompatibility laboratories around the world and could easily be implemented into routine screening of transplant candidates and recipients.",2020-12-02,"Bray, Robert A; Lee, Jar-How; Brescia, Peter; Kumar, Deepali; Nong, Thoa; Shih, Remi; Woodle, E Steve; Maltzman, Jonathan S; Gebel, Howard M",Transplantation,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003524; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33273320/,227281467.0

A rapid review of the demands on orthopaedic services at a U.K. Major Trauma Centre during the COVID‐19 pandemic,10.1111/ijcp.13690,PMC7460967,32852851.0,no-cc,"AIMS: This retrospective study aims to quantify the early impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on trauma and orthopaedic surgery at a Major Trauma Centre (MTC) in the United Kingdom. We hypothesise that the social restrictions placed on the public by the government will reduce the amount of trauma presentations and operations performed. METHODS: A database of all trauma patients at the MTC was retrospectively reviewed from start of social restrictions on 16(th) March 2020, to 22(nd) April 2020 inclusive. Referrals to the orthopaedic team were identified and included; these were sub‐classified into major trauma patients, fragility hip fractures and paediatric trauma. All patients undergoing surgical intervention were identified. The outcome measures were the total number of referrals and trauma operations performed in the time period. This was compared to the corresponding dates of the 2019. RESULTS: There was an overall decrease in the number of referrals to the orthopaedic team from 537 in 2019 to 265 in 2020 (50.7% reduction). The number of trauma operations carried out at the trust decreased from 227 in 2019 to 129 in 2020 (43.2% reduction). The number of paediatric referrals decreased from 56 in 2019 to 26 in 2020 (53.6% reduction), and the number of major trauma patients reduced from 147 in 2019 to 95 in 2020 (35.4%). Fragility hip fracture referrals remained similar, with 52 in 2019 compared to 49 in 2020. CONCLUSION: The COVID‐19 pandemic has had a profound effect of the provision of trauma and orthopaedic surgery. We report a significant decrease in all orthopaedic referrals during the pandemic, leading to a greatly reduced number of trauma operations performed. This has allowed for reallocation of staff and resources. We must plan for the lifting of social restrictions, which may lead to an increase in patients presenting with trauma requiring operative intervention.",2020-08-27,"Greenhalgh, Michael; Dupley, Leanne; Unsworth, Richard; Boden, Richard",Int J Clin Pract,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a770d225566b36adf62028cd2502ac0568758e1d.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32852851/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13690,221348143.0

In this review, we summarize current knowledge about the most promising experimental B- and T-cell epitopes of human metapneumovirus for the rational design of HMPV vaccines using vector delivery systems, paying special attention to the conservation of these epitopes among different lineages/genotypes of HMPV. The prospects of the successful development of an epitope-based HMPV vaccine are discussed in the context of recent findings regarding HMPV’s ability to modulate host immunity. In particular, we discuss the lack of data on experimental human CD4 T-cell epitopes for HMPV despite the role of CD4 lymphocytes in both the induction of higher neutralizing antibody titers and the establishment of CD8 memory T-cell responses.

Anti-ageism critics have taken issue with the oft-repeated statement that “only” older adults are at risk, a construction that dismisses and devalues the nuances within this population. The purpose of this study was to analyze instances of ageism in national media sources during the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic search returned 287 articles concerning older adults and COVID-19 published in four major newspapers in the United States—USA Today, The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and The Washington Post—between March 11 and April 10, 2020. Combining the strengths of content analysis and critical discourse analysis, we deductively and inductively reviewed the articles for patterns related to implicit and explicit forms of ageism. While ageism was rarely discussed explicitly, ageist bias was evident in implicit reporting patterns, such as frequent use of the phrase the elderly, which was often paired with statements describing older adults as vulnerable. Infection and death rates among older adults, as well as institutionalized care practices, were among the most commonly reported topics, providing a limited portrait of aging during the pandemic. While some authors utilized a survivor narrative by portraying older adults as having survived hardships, this construction implicitly places blame on those unable to do so. Older adults, when quoted directly, produced more complex and nuanced narratives of aging during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Purpose: To describe the preferences of cancer patients with respect to communication methods and the use of patient-accessible electronic health records (PAEHRs). To record the impact on cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and the knowledge and attitude of the patients towards it. Patients and Methods: We created a self-administered electronic survey that was piloted and evaluated for its clinical relevance. Using convenient sampling methods, we surveyed the cancer patients in our Oncology Center. Results: We received 385 responses between April 15 and April 30, 2020. The preferred method for communication was a phone call with a 92% response rate followed by the electronic patient portal, mobile application, telemedicine and text message in 75%, 76%, 73%, and 72%, respectively. The majority (97%) preferred the use of PAEHRs for appointments, 95% for drug delivery and to view laboratory tests, and 92% in requesting medical reports. In our survey, 22% of patients with cancer reported that their medical cancer care had not been affected by COVID-19.

Obesity as the main inducer of a systemic low-level inflammation is a main susceptibility factor for T2DM. Obesity-related immune cell infiltration, inflammation, and increased oxidative stress promote metabolic impairments in the insulin-sensitive tissues and finally, insulin resistance, organ failure, and premature aging occur. Hyperglycemia and the subsequent inflammation are the main causes of micro- and macroangiopathies in the circulatory system. They also promote the gut microbiota dysbiosis, increased intestinal permeability, and fatty liver disease.

Otolaryngologists are especially susceptible with the elevated risk of aerosolization and corresponding high viral loads. This study utilizes a geospatial analysis to illustrate the comparative risks of older otolaryngologists across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Demographic and state population data were extracted from the State Physician Workforce Reports published by the AAMC for the year 2018. A geospatial heat map of the United States was then constructed to illustrate the location of COVID-19 confirmed case counts and the distributions of ENTs over 60 years for each state. RESULTS: In 2018, out of a total of 9578 practicing U.S. ENT surgeons, 3081 were older than 60 years (32.2%). The states with the highest proportion of ENTs over 60 were Maine, Delaware, Hawaii, and Louisiana. The states with the highest ratios of confirmed COVID-19 cases to the number of total ENTs over 60 were New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our models, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Michigan represent states where older ENTs may be the most susceptible to developing severe complications from nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 due to a combination of high COVID-19 case volumes and a high proportion of ENTs over 60 years.",2020,"Ruthberg, Jeremy S; Quereshy, Humzah A; Jella, Tarun K; Kocharyan, Armine; D039,; Anza, Brian; Maronian, Nicole; Otteson, Todd D",Am J Otolaryngol,,#32386898,,,,,216879113.0

The objective of this experiment was to assess the productivity and economic importance of naturally occurring health challenges (HC) under commercial conditions. Three 1,000 pig grow-finish facilities received 936 pigs each. The experimental period started approximately 34 d post placement at an average start BW of 13.1 ± 0.2 kg. Barns were characterized based on the relative HC, determined by diagnostic assessments as the main characterization tool, along with other health indicators. Barns were characterized as low challenge health (LCh), moderate challenge health (MCh), and high challenge health (HCh). All barns tested positive for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection prior to the start of the experiment. Additionally, the MCh and HCh barns experienced influenza type A virus of swine. Similar to commercial production conditions, the disease challenge was not imposed but rather occurred naturally. Reduced ADG, ADFI, and G:F were observed with an increased HC (P < 0.001). Similarly, mortality was increased when the HC increased (P < 0.001). Decreased ADG increased days to achieve harvest BW, by 10 and 15 d in the MCh and HCh treatments compared with LCh, respectively (P < 0.001). No differences were observed for percent lean, loin depth, or fat depth (P > 0.10). The economic impact of the HC was assessed by applying these growth performance data to two economic models encompassing the two main marketing methods used by U.S. pig producers: fixed-weight and fixed-time. Financial losses attributed to the variation in disease severity that occurred in the present study ranged from $8.49 and $26.10 U.S. dollars (USD)/pig marketed using a fixed-market weight model, or between $11.02 and $29.82 USD/pig using a fixed-time model, depending on feed costs and market hog prices. In conclusion, increasing severity of HC under commercial conditions reduced ADG by 8% and 14% and resulted in mortality as high as 19.9%.

A recently introduced ""Pulse CO-Oximeter"" (Masimo Rainbow SET(R) Radical-7 Pulse CO-Oximeter, Masimo Corp., Irvine, CA) is intended to additionally monitor noninvasively the fractional carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin content in blood. The purpose of our study was to determine whether hypoxia affects the new device's estimated methemoglobin reading accuracy, and whether the presence of methemoglobin impairs the ability of the Radical-7 and a conventional pulse oximeter (Nonin 9700, Nonin Medical Inc., Plymouth, MN) to detect decreases in Sao2. METHODS Eight and 6 healthy adults were included in 2 study groups, respectively, each fitted with multiple sensors and a radial arterial catheter for blood sampling. In the first group, IV administration of approximately 300 mg sodium nitrite increased subjects' methemoglobin level to a 7% to 8% target and hypoxia was induced to different levels of Sao2 (70%-100%) by varying fractional inspired oxygen. In the second group, 15% methemoglobin at room air and 80% Sao2 were targeted. Pulse CO-oximeter readings were compared with arterial blood values measured using a Radiometer multiwavelength hemoximeter. Pulse CO-oximeter methemoglobin reading performance was analyzed by observing the incidence of meaningful reading errors at the various hypoxia levels. This was used to determine the impact on predictive values for detecting methemoglobinemia. Spo2 reading bias, precision, and root mean square error were evaluated during conditions of elevated methemoglobin. RESULTS Observations spanned 66.2% to 99% Sao2 and 0.6% to 14.4% methemoglobin over the 2 groups (170 blood draws). Masimo methemoglobin reading bias and precision over the full Sao2 span was 7.7% +/- 13.0%. Best accuracy was found in the 95% to 100% Sao2 range (1.9% +/- 2.5%), progressing to its worst in the 70% to 80% range (24.8% +/- 15.6%). Occurrence of methemoglobin readings in error >5% increased over each 5-point decrease in Sao2 (P < 0.05). Masimo Spo2 readings were biased -6.3% +/- 3.0% in the 95% to 100% Sao2 range with 4% to 8.3% methemoglobin. Both the Radical-7 and Nonin 9700 pulse oximeters accurately detected decreases in Sao(2) <90% with 4% to 15% methemoglobin, despite displaying low Spo2 readings when Sao2 was >95%. CONCLUSIONS The Radical-7's methemoglobin readings become progressively more inaccurate as Sao2 decreases <95%, at times overestimating true values by 10% to 40%. Elevated methemoglobin causes the Spo2 readings to underestimate Sao2 similar to conventional 2-wavelength pulse oximeters at high saturation. Spo2 readings from both types of instruments continue to trend downward during the development of hypoxemia (Sao2 <90%) with methemoglobin levels up to 15%.",2010,"Feiner, John R; Bickler, Philip E; Mannheimer, Paul D",Anesthesia and analgesia,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e3181c91bb6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20007731/,7851991.0

This study aimed at determining the perceptions of Canaanland, an emerging urban community in Ogun State, Nigeria, on treated wastewater reuse for several purposes. Data were collected through questionnaires administered to the city residents (n = 244). Findings revealed that the city was aware of the economic and environmental benefits of wastewater reuse but would prefer reuse schemes that involved less human contact such as flushing toilets, electricity generation, building construction, and car wash. The least preferred option was for potable purposes. The community also revealed that they would be willing to accept wastewater reuse as long as it is endorsed by medical doctors, university professors, and experts. However, 45.5% of the respondents were from the Covenant University academic environment. Also, an assessment was carried out to ascertain the implications and opportunities for wastewater reuse in the city. Findings indicated that wastewater reuse involves several complexities and interlinkages, which revolve around political and decisional factors, economic and social factors, environmental factors, and technological factors. From the study, policy and decisional suggestions and a wastewater process flow were developed for more efficient wastewater management within developing cities. A study was carried out on eight cities from developing nations that have created a framework for wastewater management using several approaches. Also, a summary of findings reveals that if adequately researched, cheap and alternative means of wastewater treatment and reuse could be developed for electricity generation, carwash, and firefighting for developing nations.

After the Al-doping process, the Ead and S values increase to -40.7 kcal/mol and 83.9, respectively, indicating an excellent agreement with the experimental results. We showed a relation between the HOMO-LUMO gap and the S value, confirming with the experimental results. Also, the proposed Al-doped ZnO nanosheet shows a good selectivity to HCHO gas at the presence of H2, NH3, C2H5OH, CO, and CH4 gases.

N/OFQ and its receptor, NOP, are enriched in dopaminergic pathways, and intra-ventricular agonist delivery decreases dopamine levels in the dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens (NAc), and ventral tegmental area (VTA). We used whole cell electrophysiology in acute rat midbrain slices to investigate synaptic actions of N/OFQ. N/OFQ was primarily inhibitory, causing outward currents in both immunocytochemically identified dopaminergic (tyrosine hydroxylase positive (TH(+)) and non-dopaminergic (TH(−)) VTA neurons (effect at 1 μM: 20 ± 4 pA). Surprisingly, this effect was mediated by augmentation of postsynaptic GABAAR currents, unlike the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), where the N/OFQ induced outward currents were K+ channel dependent. A smaller population, 19% of all VTA neurons, responded to low concentrations N/OFQ with inward currents (10 nM: −11 ± 2 pA). Following 100 nM N/OFQ, the response to a second N/OFQ application was markedly diminished in VTA neurons (14 ± 10% of first response), but not in SNc neurons (90 ± 20% of first response). N/OFQ generated outward currents in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)-projecting VTA neurons, but inward currents in a subset of posterior anterior cingulate cortex-projecting VTA neurons. While N/OFQ inhibited NAc-projecting VTA cell bodies, it had little effect on electrically or optogenetically evoked terminal dopamine release in the NAc measured ex vivo with fast scan cyclic voltammetry. These results extend our understanding of the N/OFQ system in brainstem circuits implicated in many neurobehavioral disorders. Significance statement The neuropeptide nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) and its receptor (NOP) are engaged under conditions of stress and are associated with reward processing disorders. Both peptide and receptor are highly enriched in ventral tegmental area (VTA) pathways underlying motivation and reward. Using whole cell electrophysiology in rat midbrain slices we found: 1) NOPs are functional on both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic VTA neurons; 2) N/OFQ differentially regulates VTA neurons based on neuroanatomical projection target; and 3) repeated application of N/OFQ produces evidence of receptor desensitization in the VTA but not the SNc.

A major virulence factor of SARS-CoVs is the nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1), which suppresses host gene expression by ribosome association. Here, we show that Nsp1 from SARS-CoV-2 binds to the 40S ribosomal subunit, resulting in shutdown of messenger RNA (mRNA) translation both in vitro and in cells. Structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy of in vitro-reconstituted Nsp1-40S and various native Nsp1-40S and -80S complexes revealed that the Nsp1 C terminus binds to and obstructs the mRNA entry tunnel. Thereby, Nsp1 effectively blocks retinoic acid-inducible gene I-dependent innate immune responses that would otherwise facilitate clearance of the infection.

The characteristics of SARS distribution in time, place and population in Shanxi were described. The epidemiological characteristics and related influential factors were analyzed with EPI info 6.0 software. RESULTS Since the first imported SARS case was diagnosed clinically on 7 March and till 20 May in Shanxi province, the number of cumulative clinically-diagnosed SARS cases were 445 with an attack rate of 1.34/10,000. 20 deaths occurred in that period with the mortality rate 4.49%. The number of cases increased from 28 March and formed the first peak. However, the number continued to increase until 18 April to have formed the second peak. Since then, the number of cases has gradually decreased gradually. Since 19 May, there has been no clinically-diagnosed cases being reported.

RESULTS: We included seven studies (N= 792) in the meta-analysis. The heterogeneity (I2 83.0%, p< 0.001)was significantly decreased when we included the study quality and the statistical model used as moderator variables (I2 15%).

RESULTS A single giant virus, called Shan, was isolated from the stool of a Tunisian patient with pneumonia who responded poorly to antibiotics. This virus has an icosahedral shape typical of members of the family Mimiviridae and a size of 640 ± 10 nm. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Shan virus was classified as a member of Mimivirus lineage C that infects amoebae. CONCLUSION Only one isolate was obtained in this study, suggesting that giant viruses of amoebae are rare in human stool. The isolation of Shan virus from a patient with pneumonia brings into question the etiological role of this virus and its subsequent release in stool.",2013,"Saadi, Hanene; Reteno, Dorine-Gaelle Ikanga; Colson, Philippe; Aherfi, Sarah; Minodier, Philippe; Pagnier, Isabelle; Raoult, Didier; La Scola, Bernard",Intervirology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1159/000354564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24157888/,3669267.0

METHODS: From February to March 2020, we prospectively and retrospectively enrolled consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Patient's data such as the demographic characteristics, symptoms, vital signs, laboratory and radiologic findings, electrocardiographic, and echocardiographic data, including the global longitudinal strain (GLS) of both ventricles, were obtained. RESULTS: Forty patients (median age, 58 years; 50% men) were enrolled in the initial analysis. Patients were classified into severe and nonsevere groups based on the current guidelines. The 13 patients in the severe group were significantly older, had a greater prevalence of bilateral pneumonia and leukocytosis, and higher aspartate transaminase levels than patients in the nonsevere group. Patients in the severe group had a slightly lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) than those in the nonsevere group (median [interquartile range], 61.0% [58.5%, 62.3%] vs. 66.7% [60.6%, 69.8%], P = 0.015). In a subgroup of 34 patients in whom GLS could be analyzed, patients in the severe group had a significantly impaired left ventricular GLS (LVGLS) than those in the nonsevere group (−18.1% [−18.8%, −17.1%] vs. −21.7% [−22.9%, −19.9%], P = 0.001). There were no significant differences in total wall (RVGLS(total), −19.3% [−23.9%, −18.4%] vs. −24.3% [−26.0%, −22.6%], P = 0.060) and free wall (RVGLS(fw), −22.7% [−27.2%, −18.6%] vs. −28.8% [−30.4%, −24.1%], P = 0.066) right ventricle GLS (RVGLS).

This was the method of choice for more than 20 years, but more efficient protocols are now available, based on somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) which permits targeted genetic modifications. Although the efficiency of transgenic animal production by microinjection technology is low, many animals with agriculturally important transgenic traits were produced. Typical applications included improved carcass composition, lactational performance, and wool production as well as enhanced disease resistance and reduced environmental impact. Transgenic animal production for biomedical applications has found broad acceptance. In 2006 the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) approved the commercialization of the first recombinant protein drug produced by transgenic animals. Recombinant antithrombin III, produced in the mammary gland of transgenic goats, was launched as ATryn® for prophylactic treatment of patients with congenital antithrombin deficiency. Pigs expressing human immunomodulatory genes have contributed to significant progress in xenotransplantation research with survival periods of non-human primates receiving transgenic porcine hearts or kidneys approaching six months. Lentiviral vectors and small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) technology are also emerging as important tools for transgenesis. As the genome sequencing projects for various farm animal species progress, it has become increasingly practical to target the removal or modification of individual genes.

Accordingly, IBD arises as a result of inappropriate immune response to intestinal commensal organisms among genetically susceptible individuals. Performing colonoscopy and histopathologic evaluation on an inflamed bowel biopsy specimen are currently considered as gold standards for diagnosis and management of IBD. Correspondingly, these techniques are known to be invasive and costly. In recent decades, fecal calprotectin, as a biomarker, has received much attention for the diagnosis and non-invasive management of IBD. Up to now, many studies have investigated the efficacy of fecal calprotectin in the areas of IBD differentiation from IBS, prediction of endoscopic and histologic activities of IBD and prediction of disease recurrence. Although some of these studies have reported promising results, some others have shown significant limitations. Therefore, in this paper, we reviewed the most interesting ones of these studies after a brief discussion of the laboratory measurement of fecal calprotectin. Moreover, we attempted to provide an answer for the question of whether fecal-calprotectin could be considered as a potential surrogate marker for colonoscopy.",2020,"Khaki-Khatibi, Fatemeh; Qujeq, Durdi; Kashifard, Mehrdad; Moein, Soheila; Maniati, Mahmood; Vaghari-Tabari, Mostafa",Clin Chim Acta,,#720116,,,,,221140912.0

However, the characteristics of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells in children, especially the preterm and SGA populations, are poorly understood. Here, we examined the frequency and antiviral function of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells in neonates, including preterm, SGA and full-term babies. When compared to adults, neonates had a significantly lower percentage of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells in the blood. Upon influenza virus stimulation, neonatal Vγ9Vδ2-T cells, especially from preterm and SGA babies, showed markedly decreased and delayed antiviral cytokine responses than those of adults. In addition, the antiviral responses of neonatal Vγ9Vδ2-T cells were positively correlated with gestational age and birth weight. Finally, a weaker expansion of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells by isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) was shown in neonates than the expansion in adults. Our data suggest that the depressed antiviral activity and decreased frequency of Vγ9Vδ2-T cells may likely account for the high susceptibility to microbial infection in neonates, particularly in preterm and SGA babies.

The worm typically emerges through the skin on a lower limb approximately 1 year after infection, resulting in pain and disability (1). There is no vaccine or medicine to treat the disease; eradication efforts rely on case containment* to prevent water contamination. Other interventions to prevent infection include health education, water filtration, chemical treatment of unsafe water with temephos (an organophosphate larvicide to kill copepods), and provision of safe drinking water (1,2). The worldwide eradication campaign began in 1980 at CDC (1). In 1986, with an estimated 3.5 million cases occurring each year in 20 African and Asian countries§ (3), the World Health Assembly (WHA) called for dracunculiasis elimination (4). The global Guinea Worm Eradication Program (GWEP), led by the Carter Center and supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), United Nations Children's Fund, CDC, and other partners, began assisting ministries of health in countries with dracunculiasis.

The heterotrophic bacterium Cupriavidus pinatubonensis JMP134 contains several enzymes involved in sulfur oxidation, but how these enzymes work together to oxidize sulfide in the bacterium has not been studied. Using gene-deletion and whole cell assays, we determined that the bacterium uses sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase to oxidize sulfide to polysulfide, which is further oxidized to sulfite by persulfide dioxygenase. Sulfite spontaneously reacts with polysulfide to produce thiosulfate. The Sox system oxidizes thiosulfate to sulfate. Flavocytochrome c sulfide dehydrogenase enhances thiosulfate oxidation by the Sox system, but couples with the Sox system for sulfide oxidation to sulfate in the absence of sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase. Thus, C. pinatubonensis JMP134 contains a main pathway and a contingent pathway for sulfide oxidation.Importance We establish a new pathway of sulfide oxidation with thiosulfate as a key intermediate in Cupriavidus pinatubonensis JMP134.

Distress and clinical depression were identified with the use of cut-off and a previously developed algorithm respectively. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: A post-stratification method was used; descriptive statistics were calculated. Chi-square tests, multiple forward stepwise linear regression analyses and Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tested relations among variables. RESULTS: Clinical depression was present in 9.31% of the stratified sample, while 8.5% had severe distress; increased anxiety was present in more than 45%. Suicidal thoughts increased in 10.40% and decreased in 4.42%. Beliefs in conspiracy theories were widely prevalent; at least half of cases were following various misconceptions.

However, there is no comprehensive study on the role of NOXs in high glucose (HG)-induced toxic effect in neural tissues. Recently, a therapeutic strategy in oxidative related pathologies has been introduced by blocking the undesirable actions of NOX enzymes by small molecules. The protective roles of Statins in ameliorating oxidative stress by NOX inhibition have been shown in some tissues except neural. We hypothesized then, that different NOXs may have role in HG-induced neural cell injury. Furthermore, we postulate that Atorvastatin as a small molecule may modulate this NOXs activity to protect neural cells. Undifferentiated PC12 cells were treated with HG (140 mM/24 h) in the presence and absence of Atorvastatin (1 μM/96 h). The cell viability was measured by MTT assay and the gene and protein expressions profile of NOX (1–4) were determined by RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. Levels of ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA) were also evaluated. Gene and protein expression levels of NOX (1–4) and consequently ROS and MDA levels were elevated in HG-treated PC12 cells. Atorvastatin could significantly decrease HG-induced NOXs, ROS and MDA elevation and improve impaired cell viability. It can be concluded that HG could elevate NOXs activity, ROS and MDA levels in neural tissues and Atorvastatin as a small molecule NOX inhibitor drug may prevent and delay diabetic complications, particularly neuropathy.",2016-08-01,"Rayegan, Samira; Dehpour, Ahmad Reza; Sharifi, Ali Mohammad",Metab Brain Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/15cb85573f9951cd1d647e3744c7be4d8fedf846.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102122.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102122/,

Air quality data – in particular NO(2) and PM(10) hourly concentration - from more than 20 monitoring stations spread over mainland Portugal was used to perform this evaluation. The mean reduction observed on pollutant concentrations was higher for NO(2) (41%) than for PM(10) (18%). For NO(2), mean reductions were more significant in traffic (reaching values higher than 60% in some monitoring stations) and background urban sites than in rural stations.

As the coronavirus outbreak began spreading, hospitals were forced to relocate resources to treat the growing number of COVID-19 patients. As a consequence, doctors across the country canceled tens of thousands of nonurgent surgeries. However, recognizing that the COVID-19 situation may be highly variable and fluid in different communities across the country, elective surgery could be still allowed in some centers for patients included in the high-priority class. The majority of endocrine disorders requiring surgical treatment in patients identifiable as first-priority class, or needing hospitalization within 30 days, are generally represented by malignant thyroid tumors, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and some adrenal disorders. The need for urgent intervention is evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to the severity of the symptoms, the likelihood of progression, and global clinical judgment. On the basis of the above indications, during the last 4 weeks, we performed 18 planned surgical treatments in patients with thyroid cancer (total thyroidectomies, plus lymph node dissection if needed) or multinodular toxic goiter. In no case, postoperative ventilatory support was needed, and the average hospital stay was 3 days. The negative COVID-19 status for all the treated patients was appropriately evaluated beforehand.

In this prospective cross-sectional study with a longitudinal component, blood lactate was quantified in 10 healthy and 34 myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) dogs to investigate its potential use as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker. While there were no differences in lactate concentration between control animals and stages B1 (3.31±0.62mmol/L) and B2 (3.32±0.46mmol/L) dogs, significant differences were found between healthy (2.50±0.69mmol/L) and both C (3.99±0.47mmol/L) and D (6.97±1.23mmol/L) animals. When a cut-off of 3.35mmol/L was used, lactate was able to distinguish dogs with normal and remodeled hearts with a sensitivity of 78.2% and specificity of 63.6%. Also, significant correlations existed between lactate and indicators of cardiac remodeling. Finally, animals with blood lactate <3.5mmol/L carried a better prognosis when compared with dogs in which lactate was >5.0mmol/L. Our results suggest that the progression of MMVD results in accumulation of lactate within the bloodstream, which is likely attributable to the impaired peripheral tissue perfusion. In MMVD dogs, blood lactate may be used as a surrogate for cardiac remodeling, and an increased concentration is associated with a worse prognosis regarding the time to evolve into congestive heart failure.(AU)",2018,"Silva-Filho, Jorge Cardoso; Sousa, Marlos G; Pereira, Evandro Zacché; Ortiz, Edna M.

s1o99ra3,,Medline,Temperature as a modulator of sexual selection.,10.1111/brv.12632,,32691483.0,unk,"A central question in ecology and evolution is to understand why sexual selection varies so much in strength across taxa; it has long been known that ecological factors are crucial to this. Temperature is a particularly salient abiotic ecological factor that modulates a wide range of physiological, morphological and behavioural traits, impacting individuals and populations at a global taxonomic scale. Furthermore, temperature exhibits substantial temporal variation (e.g. daily, seasonally and inter-seasonally), and hence for most species in the wild sexual selection will regularly unfold in a dynamic thermal environment. Unfortunately, studies have so far almost completely neglected the role of temperature as a modulator of sexual selection. Here, we outline the main pathways through which temperature can affect the intensity and form (i.e. mechanisms) of sexual selection, via: (i) direct effects on secondary sexual traits and preferences (i.e. trait variance, opportunity for selection and trait-fitness covariance), and (ii) indirect effects on key mating parameters, sex-specific reproductive costs/benefits, trade-offs, demography and correlated abiotic factors. Building upon this framework, we show that, by focusing exclusively on the first-order effects that environmental temperature has on traits linked with individual fitness and population viability, current global warming studies may be ignoring eco-evolutionary feedbacks mediated by sexual selection. Finally, we tested the general prediction that temperature modulates sexual selection by conducting a meta-analysis of available studies experimentally manipulating temperature and reporting effects on the variance of male/female reproductive success and/or traits under sexual selection. Our results show a clear association between temperature and sexual selection measures in both sexes. In short, we suggest that studying the feedback between temperature and sexual selection processes may be vital to developing a better understanding of variation in the strength of sexual selection in nature, and its consequences for population viability in response to environmental change (e.g. global warming).",2020-07-20,"García-Roa, Roberto; Garcia-Gonzalez, Francisco; Noble, Daniel W A; Carazo, Pau",Biological reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691483/,220670044.0

Each day new cases are being identified across the country in correctional facilities. People who are incarcerated are at increased risk of experiencing severe COVID-19 symptoms because of the increased prevalence of other underlying illnesses. Jails and prisons have begun initiating facility-level policies to help stop the spread of COVID-19. As a result, correctional agencies have reoriented staff to stem transmission in their facilities. This could translate into limited resources for other programming such as medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) programs.

Since COVID-19 is very recent, most studies in this field have focused on other types of coronavirus than COVID-19, such as those involved in MERS or SARS diseases. Although their number is limited, they have led to promising results on various COV using a wide range of different types of nanosystems, e.g., nanoparticles, quantum dos, or nanoassemblies of polymers/proteins. Additional efforts deserve to be spent in this field to consolidate these findings. Here, I first summarize the different nanotechnology-based methods used for COV detection, i.e., optical, electrical, or PCR ones, whose sensitivity was improved by the presence of nanoparticles. Furthermore, I present vaccination methods, which comprise nanoparticles used either as adjuvants or as active principles. They often yield a better-controlled immune response, possibly due to an improved antigen presentation/processing than in non-nanoformulated vaccines. Certain antiviral approaches also took advantage of nanoparticle uses, leading to specific mechanisms such as the blocking of virus replication at the cellular level or the reduction of a COV induced apoptotic cellular death.",2020,"Alphandéry, Edouard",Bioconjug Chem,,#637562,,,,,220436969.0

Intermittent pedicle clamping is an effective method to minimize blood loss during open liver surgery; however, inflow occlusion techniques are challenging to reproduce during laparoscopy. The purpose of this study is to describe the safety and efficacy of a facile method for Pringle maneuver during lapLR. METHODS 154 patients who underwent lapLR from 2007 to 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. For Pringle, the hepatoduodenal ligament is encircled with an umbilical tape which is externalized through a flexible Rumel tourniquet running alongside a port used for the operation. The internal end of the catheter is close to the pedicle and the external end is extracorporeal, allowing for easy external occlusion. Patients who underwent Pringle Maneuver (PM, n = 88) were compared to patients who had ""No Occlusion"" (NO, n = 66) with respect to patient characteristics, operative outcomes, changes in postoperative liver function, and complications. RESULTS Annual placement of the tourniquet and vascular occlusion increased from 35.7 to 82.8 % (p = 0.004) and 21.4 to 62.1 % (p = 0.02), respectively. Median occlusion time was 24 min (IQR 15-34.3, min 5, max 70). Peak transaminase levels were comparable between groups (AST 298 ± 32 vs 405 ± 47 U/L, p = 0.15; ALT 272 ± 27 vs 372 ± 34 U/L, p = 0.14, NO and PM, respectively). Postoperative transaminase and bilirubin levels for both groups were not significantly different with similar recovery to baseline. Subgroup analysis of cirrhotic patients who underwent Pringle demonstrated similar transaminase profiles compared to non-cirrhotic patients. There were two conversions (1.3 %) and postoperative 30-day mortality was 0.65 %.

Compared with the control group, the nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) content of the bulk soil in the low PFOS (0.1 mg kg-1) treatment significantly decreased (27.7%), the ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) content significantly increased (8.7%), and the pH value and total organic carbon (TOC) content slightly increased (0.3% and 1.1%, respectively). Compared with the low PFOS treatment, the content of NO3-N, NH4+-N and pH value in the bulk soil of the high PFOS treatment (50 mg kg-1) significantly increased (1.0%, 53.8% and 61.8%, respectively), and the TOC content significantly decreased (8.2%). Soil protease levels were high in the low PFOS treatment, but low in the high PFOS treatment. PFOS produced inverted U-shaped responses in the potential nitrification (1.5, 3.0, and 1.1 mg N d-1 kg-1 in no, low, and high PFOS, respectively), denitrification (0.19, 0.30, and 0.22 mg N d-1 kg-1 in no, low, and high PFOS, respectively), and N2O emission rates (0.01, 0.03, and 0.02 mg N d-1 kg-1 in no, low, and high PFOS, respectively) of bulk soil. The abundance of the archaea amoA gene decreased with increasing PFOS concentration, whereas that of bacterial amoA increased; inverted U-shaped responses were observed for narG, nirK, nirS, and nosZ. In the PFOS-contaminated rhizosphere soil, the observed changes differed from those in the bulk soil and differed between treatments. P. communis tended to upregulate each step of the nitrogen cycle under low PFOS conditions, whereas L. salicaria tended to inhibit them.

However, mesh fixation with sutures to avoid dislocation has been considered as a cause of chronic pain and discomfort. A new self-gripping mesh (Parietene Progrip; Coviden) has been developed, which is making the use of sutureless for inguinal hernia repair. The aim of this systematic review was to compare the outcomes of open Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair using new self-gripping mesh or sutured mesh. METHODS PubMed/MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and reference lists were searched for controlled trials of self-gripping mesh versus sutured mesh for open inguinal hernia repair from January 2005 to February 2013. The primary outcomes were chronic pain and recurrence. Secondary outcomes were duration of operation, wound infection, hematoma, seroma formation, postoperative pain, hospital stay, and time to return to work. The methodology was in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for interventional systematic reviews and written based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. RESULTS A total of seven studies, representing 1353 patients were included. There was no effect on chronic pain (risk difference -0.02 [95% confidence interval -0.07 to 0.03], P = 0.40) or recurrence (risk difference -0.00 [95% confidence interval -0.01 to 0.01], P = 0.57). No significant differences were noted in terms of secondary outcomes, such as wound infection, hematoma, and seroma formation, between self-gripping and sutured mesh repair.

The effect of this anatomical variant on ACoA aneurysm morphology is not well understood. METHODS Digital subtraction angiography images were reviewed for 204 patients presenting to the authors' institution with either a ruptured or an unruptured ACoA aneurysm. The ratio of the width of the larger A1 segment to the smaller A1 segment was calculated. Patients with an A1 ratio greater than 2 were categorized as having A1 segment hypoplasia. The relationship of A1 segment hypoplasia to both patient and aneurysm characteristics was then assessed. RESULTS Of 204 patients that presented with an ACoA aneurysm, 34 (16.7%) were found to have a hypoplastic A1. Patients with A1 segment hypoplasia were less likely to have a history of smoking (44.1% vs 62.9%, p = 0.0410). ACoA aneurysms occurring in the setting of a hypoplastic A1 were also found to have a larger maximum diameter (mean 7.7 vs 6.0 mm, p = 0.0084). When considered as a continuous variable, increasing A1 ratio was associated with decreasing aneurysm dome-to-neck ratio (p = 0.0289). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of A1 segment hypoplasia between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms (18.9% vs 10.7%; p = 0.1605). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that a hypoplastic A1 may affect the morphology of ACoA aneurysms.

Embelin, a quinone natural product, is known to have antiviral activity against influenza and hepatitis B. Preliminary studies by our group also indicate its ability to inhibit HSV-1 in cultured cells. METHODS: Docking and DFT methods applied to the protease target. RESULTS: a mechanism for this inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protease is described, specifically due to formation of a covalent bond between S(Cys145) and an embelin C(carbonyl). This is assisted by two protein amino acids (1) N(imidazole-His41) which is able to capture H[S(Cys145)] and (2) HN(Met165), which donates a proton to embelin O(carbonyl) forming an OH moiety that results in inhibition of the viral protease. A similar process is also seen with the anti-inflammatory drugs methyl prednisolone and dexamethasone, used for Covid-19 patients. Methyl prednisolone and dexamethasone are methide quinones, and possess only one carbonyl moiety, instead of two for embelin. Additional consideration was given to another natural product, emodin, recently patented against Covid-19, as well as some therapeutic quinones, vitamin K, suspected to be involved in Covid-19 action, and coenzyme Q10. All show structural similarities with embelin, dexamethasone and methyl prednisolone results.

The nsp13 of highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV exhibit the most conserved CoV replicases. Using single-molecule FRET, we observed that MERS-CoV nsp13 unwound DNA in discrete steps of approximately 9 bp when ATP was used. If another NTP was used, then the steps were only 4 to 5 bp. In dwell time analysis, we detected 3 or 4 hidden steps in each unwinding process, which indicated the hydrolysis of 3 or 4 dTTP. Based on crystallographic and biochemical studies of CoV nsp13 helicases, we modeled an unwinding mechanism similar to the spring-loaded mechanism of HCV NS3 helicase, although our model proposes that flexible 1B and stalk domains, by allowing a lag greater than 4 bp during unwinding, cause the accumulated tension on the nsp13-DNA complex. The hinge region between two RecA-like domains in SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 is intrinsically more flexible than in MERS-CoV nsp13 due to the difference of a single amino acid, which causes the former to induce significantly greater NTP hydrolysis. Our findings thus establish a blueprint for determining the unwinding mechanism of a unique helicase family. When dTTP was used as the energy source, 4 hidden steps in each individual unwinding step after 3 - 4 NTP hydrolysis were observed. An unwinding model of MERS-CoV-nsp13 which is similar to the spring-loaded mechanism of HCV NS3 helicase, except the accumulation of tension on nsp13/DNA complex is caused by the flexible 1B and stalk domains that allow a lag of 4-bp in unwinding. Comparing to MERS-CoV nsp13, the hinge region between two RecA-like domains in SARS-CoV-2 nsp13 is intrinsically more flexible due to a single amino acid difference, which contributes to the significantly higher NTP hydrolysis by SARS-CoV-2 nsp13.",2020-08-03,"Hu, Xiao; Hao, Wei; Qin, Bo; Tian, Zhiqi; Li, Ziheng; Hou, Pengjiao; Zhao, Rong; Cui, Sheng; Diao, Jiajie",bioRxiv,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.02.233510,220975758.0

OBJECTIVE To determine whether facility-level fluoroquinolone use predicts healthcare facility-associated (HCFA) CDI due to fluoroquinolone-resistant 027 strains. METHODS Using a nationwide cohort of hospitalized patients in the Veterans' Affairs Healthcare System, we identified hospitals that categorized >80% of CDI cases as positive or negative for the 027 strain for at least one-quarter of fiscal years 2011-2018. Within these facilities, we used visual summaries and multilevel logistic regression models to assess the association between facility-level fluoroquinolone use and rates of HCFA-CDI due to 027 strains, controlling for time and facility complexity level, and adjusting for correlated outcomes within facilities. RESULTS Between 2011 and 2018, 55 hospitals met criteria for reporting 027 results, including a total of 5,091 HCFA-CDI cases, with 1,017 infections (20.0%) due to 027 strains.

BACKGROUND Breastfeeding benefits mothers, infants and society yet breastfeeding rates continue to fall below recommendations in part due to inadequate tailored support after hospital discharge. Influences on breastfeeding are complex and include many physiological, psychosocial and cultural factors. AIM To better understand the experience of women who have feelings of aversion during breastfeeding by synthesising the existing literature. METHODS MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Maternity and Infant Care databases were searched for relevant literature published between 2000 to 2019. Using Covidence software, five qualitative research studies were identified. Studies were then analysed using meta-ethnographic qualitative synthesis. FINDINGS Feelings of aversion during breastfeeding were described as visceral and overwhelming; leading to feelings of shame and inadequacy. This synthesis identified five findings; a central conceptual category of ""it's such a strong feeling of get away from me"" with four key metaphors translated from this central conceptual category: ""I do it because I feel it is best for my baby"", ""I can't control those feelings"", ""I should be able to breastfeed my son and enjoy it"", and ""I'm glad I did it"".

Results from each antibody test were related to four explanatory variables (breed, age, gender and health status at the time of blood collection) using univariate ordinal logistic regression analyses, Mann Whitney U tests, one-sample sign tests or Kruskal-Wallis analyses, as appropriate. RESULTS Results from 637 Coronase and 191 7B FIP antibody tests were recorded. There were significant differences in median Coronase antibody titres between breeds of cats (P < 0.0005). Specifically, the median Coronase antibody titres of Siamese, Persians, Domestic Shorthairs and Bengal cats (100) were significantly lower than that of British Shorthairs, Cornish Rex and Burmese cats (400, P < 0.0005). There was no statistical relationship between the Coronase or 7B FIP antibody titres and age, gender or overall health status, even when considering only those cats in which clinical signs suggestive of FIP were present. CONCLUSION This study reinforces the complexity of interpreting serological tests for FCoV in both healthy cats and patients with signs compatible with FIR Unique to this study is the detection of a significant relationship between breed and median FCoV antibody titre. This supports the theory that breed related differences exist in response to FCoV infection. The distribution of median Coronase antibody titres by breed was very similar to the pattern of breed predisposition to FIP recently reported in Sydney.",2006,"Bell, E T; Malik, R; Norris, J M",Australian veterinary journal,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16498826/,40873686.0

She required intubation, chest tube insertion, and bilateral ureteric stenting as part of her intensive care management. These extra-cutaneous complications of renal and pulmonary systems were likely secondary to widespread epithelial detachment. CONCLUSION: Despite paucity of cases in adult literature, post-renal causes for acute kidney injury must be considered in SJS, especially in the setting of gross haematuria. Bedside point-of-care ultrasonography may be a useful tool for excluding obstructive uropathy.

Single cell RNA profiling of healthy living donor and kidney biopsies from patients with diabetic kidney disease revealed ACE2 expression primarily in proximal tubular epithelial cells. This cell specific localization was confirmed by in situ hybridization. ACE2 expression levels were unaltered by exposures to renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors in diabetic kidney disease. Bayesian integrative analysis of a large compendium of public-omics datasets identified molecular network modules induced in ACE2-expressing proximal tubular epithelial cells in diabetic kidney disease (searchable at hb.flatironinstitute.org/covid-kidney) that were linked to viral entry, immune activation, endomembrane reorganization, and RNA processing.

In this study, a TaqMan reverse transcription (RT)‐polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for rapid detection and quantification of the viral RNA of various JEV strains. A consensus JEV NS3 region was chosen to design the primers and the TaqMan probe. The JEV TaqMan assay used the EZ‐rTtH RT‐PCR system featuring advantages such as a one‐step, high‐temperature RT reaction modality and preventing carry‐over contamination. The sensitivity of the JEV TaqMan assay for detecting in vitro‐transcribed JEV NS3 RNA was estimated to be one to five copies of RNA per reaction. For cultured JE virions, less than 40 plaque forming unit (PFU)/ml of virus load (corresponding to 0.07 PFU/test) could be detected. In addition, the JEV TaqMan assay could detect all seven strains of JEV tested, but provided negative results for nine other flaviviruses and encephalitis viruses tested. The JEV TaqMan assay demonstrated greater sensitivity and specificity than traditional RT‐PCR methods as has been previously reported. The application of the JEV TaqMan assay herein has been shown to the sensitive detection of the JEV from both mosquito pools and also JEV‐spiking human blood. The assay should be of use in diagnostic laboratory conduct and could be used to replace or complement time‐consuming viral‐culture methods, thus achieving more rapid, sensitive, and highly specific identification of JEV infection.

Despite their expected value for organizations, little is known about the effectiveness of interactive analytical dashboards in operational DSS or their influences on human cognitive abilities. This paper contributes to the closing of this gap by exploring and empirically testing the effects of interactive analytical dashboard features on situation awareness (SA) and task performance in operational DSS. Using the theoretical lens of SA, we develop hypotheses about the effects of a what-if analysis as an interactive analytical dashboard feature on operational decision-makers' SA and task performance. The resulting research model is studied with a laboratory experiment, including eye-tracking data of 83 participants. Our findings show that although a what-if analysis leads to higher task performance, it may also reduce SA, nourishing a potential out-of-the-loop problem. Thus, designers and users of interactive analytical dashboards have to carefully mitigate these effects in the implementation and application of operational DSS.

Patients were recruited at the Emergency Room of St. Andrea Hospital (Rome, Italy). Kyn and Trp serum levels were assessed by HPLC/MS-MS. Compared to healthy controls, both SARS-CoV2-negative and -positive patients showed an increase in the Kyn:Trp ratio. The increase was larger in SARS-CoV2-positive patients, with a significant difference between SARS-CoV2-positive and -negative patients. In addition, the increase was more prominent in males, and positively correlated with age and severity of SARS-CoV2 infection, categorized as follows: 1 = no need for intensive care unit (ICU); 2 &#8804; 3 weeks spent in ICU; 3 &#8805; 3 weeks spent in ICU; and 4 = death. The highest Kyn:Trp values were found in SARS-CoV2-positive patients with severe lymphopenia.

A total of 3078 specimens were characterized as solid, semisolid, or liquid. Of 2568 specimens processed by EM a virus was demonstrated in 8.6% of liquid, 19.9% of semisolid and 25.2% of solid specimens (Chi-squared for lienar trend, P value <0.0001). This observation was valid for both adenovirus (2.4%, 5.0% and 6.6%) and rotavirus (5.2% , 13.6% and 16.6%).

METHODS AND RESULTS: In a prospective international survey, we captured echocardiography findings in patients with presumed or confirmed COVID-19 between 3 and 20 April 2020. Patient characteristics, indications, findings, and impact of echocardiography on management were recorded. Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors of echocardiographic abnormalities. A total of 1216 patients [62 (52-71) years, 70% male] from 69 countries across six continents were included. Overall, 667 (55%) patients had an abnormal echocardiogram. Left and right ventricular abnormalities were reported in 479 (39%) and 397 (33%) patients, respectively, with evidence of new myocardial infarction in 36 (3%), myocarditis in 35 (3%), and takotsubo cardiomyopathy in 19 (2%). Severe cardiac disease (severe ventricular dysfunction or tamponade) was observed in 182 (15%) patients. In those without pre-existing cardiac disease (n = 901), the echocardiogram was abnormal in 46%, and 13% had severe disease. Independent predictors of left and right ventricular abnormalities were distinct, including elevated natriuretic peptides [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75-5.05) and cardiac troponin (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.13-2.53) for the former, and severity of COVID-19 symptoms (OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.73-6.10) for the latter.

This is well established for other coronaviruses. In order to understand why some patients develop such symptoms and others do not, we address herein the infectability of the central nervous system (CNS). Reports that the ACE2 receptor - critical for virus entry into lung cells - is found in different neurons supports this expectation. We employ a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived BrainSphere model, which we used earlier for Zika, Dengue, HIV and John Cunningham virus infection studies. We detected the expression of the ACE2 receptor but not TMPRSS2 in the model. Incubating the BrainSpheres for 6 hours with SARS-CoV-2 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 led to the infection of a fraction of neural cells with replication of the virus evident 72 hours later. Virus particles were found in the neuronal cell body extending into apparent neurite structures. PCR measurements corroborated the replication of the virus, suggesting at least a tenfold increase in virus copies per total RNA. Leveraging state-of-the-art 3D organotypic cell culture, which has been shown to allow both virus infection and (developmental) neurotoxicity but is at the same time simple enough to be transferred and used in a BSL-3 environment, we demonstrate, for the first time, the potential critically important neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2.",2020-06-26,"Bullen, C Korin; Hogberg, Helena T; Bahadirli-Talbott, Asli; Bishai, William R; Hartung, Thomas; Keuthan, Casey; Looney, Monika M; Pekosz, Andrew; Romero, July C; Sillé, Fenna C M; Um, Peter; Smirnova, Lena",ALTEX,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.14573/altex.2006111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32591839/,220120300.0

RECENT FINDINGS Recent studies on subgroups of critical care patients include data from many different countries. These new studies provide important information on the overall incidence of these disease states, but most of these international studies do not take into account the critical care resources of the countries being discussed. For an appropriate interpretation of findings the relevant baseline critical care resources, prevalence of diseases, and cultural practices, need to be quantified. The existence of these other factors prevents the use of a severity of illness scoring system alone to account for differences between countries.

METHODS: We report three representative case-scenarios on patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 to provide a practical approach based on the existing literature and the clinical experience of an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry. CASE-CENTERED RECOMMENDATIONS: Psychopharmacological ongoing treatments should be prioritized and most doses should be reduced 25-50% of original dose if the patient receives lopinavir/ritonavir, with some exceptions including quetiapine, asenapine, olanzapine, sertraline, lamotrigine, bupropion, and methadone. If the psychopharmacological usual doses are in the low-to-median range levels, a dose change during COVID-19 drugs co-administration is not recommended, but only ECG and clinical monitoring of adverse effects and drug levels if required. Furthermore, when introducing a psychopharmacological drug, dose titration should be progressive, with ECG monitoring if cardiotoxic interactions are present. (A) In agitated delirium, olanzapine is recommended as first-line antipsychotic and quetiapine should be avoided. (B) In severe mental illness (SMI), essential treatments should be maintained. (C) In non-SMI with depressive/anxiety symptoms, psychological support should be provided and symptoms identified and treated. LIMITATIONS: Most recommendations on pharmacological interactions provide only a limited qualitative approach and quantitative recommendations are lacking. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 should be managed on a personalized basis considering several clinical criteria and, should not be excluded from receiving COVID-19 treatments. Risks of pharmacological interaction are not absolute and should be contextualized, and most psychopharmacological treatments should include an ECG with special attention to QTc interval.",2020,"Anmella, G; Arbelo, N; Fico, G; Murru, A; Llach, C D; Madero, S; Gomes-da-Costa, S; Imaz, M L; López-Pelayo, H; Vieta, E; Pintor, L",J Affect Disord,,#629905,,,,,220527939.0

We aimed at determining and characterizing the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the resulting seroprevalence in a defined population. The primary objective of the study was to assess SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence using six different IgG detecting immunoassays. Secondary objectives of the study were: i.) to determine potential risk factors for symptomatic vs. asymptomatic Covid19 courses; ii.) to investigate the rate of virus RNA-persistence. METHODS: CoNAN is a population-based cohort study performed in the community Neustadt am Rennsteig, Germany that was quarantined from March 22(nd) to April 5(th) after six SARS-CoV-2 cases were detected in the villages’ population. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak compromised 51 cases and 3 deaths. The CoNAN study was performed from May 13th to May 22nd 2020 six weeks after a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. RESULTS: We enrolled a total of 626 participants (71% of the community population) for PCR- and antibody testing in the study. All actual SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were negative. Fifty-two out of 620 (8.4%) participants had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in at least two different assays. There were 38 participants with previously PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those, only 19 (50%) displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We also show that antibody positive participants with symptoms compatible with a respiratory tract infection had significantly higher antibody levels then asymptomatic participants (EU-assay: Median 2.9 vs. 7.2 IgG-index, p=0.002; DS-assay: Median 45.2 vs. 143 AU/mL, p=0.002).

RESULTS: During the adaptation of existing MIS MEDIS.NET 4 new and 9 existing modules were developed. A quick questionnaire for the smart triage of patients was also implemented. DISCUSSION: The adapted MIS successfully influenced the reduction of social contacts within the Health Center Nis. The need for the arrival of children and their parents to receive appropriate health certificates for the school enrolment is reduced. The therapy of chronic patients has been prolonged for 6 months via an electronic prescription. An online service for the communication between patients and the chosen physicians is provided. Possible social contacts and exposure to the viral environment of patients are reduced by making appointments in extended slots and at determined physical locations. Patients are notified per SMS or email about the availability of chosen and physician on duty. The social distancing of patients and physicians is also established by sending laboratory analyses per email or SMS. Keeping the central registry for COVID-19 is enabled throughout the country.

The NGS workflow comprises several steps, namely sample processing, library preparation, sequencing and primary/secondary/tertiary bioinformatics (BI) analyses. The latter is constituted by a complex process extremely difficult to standardize, due to the variety of tools and metrics available. Thus, it is of the utmost importance to assess the comparability of results obtained through different methods and in different laboratories. To achieve this goal, we have organized a proficiency test focused on the bioinformatics components for the generation of complete genome sequences of salmonid rhabdoviruses. METHODS Three partners, that performed virus sequencing using different commercial library preparation kits and NGS platforms, gathered together and shared with each other 75 raw datasets which were analyzed separately by the participants to produce a consensus sequence according to their own bioinformatics pipeline. Results were then compared to highlight discrepancies, and a subset of inconsistencies were investigated more in detail. RESULTS In total, we observed 526 discrepancies, of which 39.5% were located at genome termini, 14.1% at intergenic regions and 46.4% at coding regions. Among these, 10 SNPs and 99 indels caused changes in the protein products. Overall reproducibility was 99.94%. Based on the analysis of a subset of inconsistencies investigated more in-depth, manual curation appeared the most critical step affecting sequence comparability, suggesting that the harmonization of this phase is crucial to obtain comparable results. The analysis of a calibrator sample allowed assessing BI accuracy, being 99.983%. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated the applicability and the usefulness of BI proficiency testing to assure the quality of NGS data, and recommend a wider implementation of such exercises to guarantee sequence data uniformity among different virology laboratories.",2019-11-21,"Zamperin, Gianpiero; Lucas, Pierrick; Cano, Irene; Ryder, David; Abbadi, Miriam; Stone, David; Cuenca, Argelia; Vigouroux, Estelle; Blanchard, Yannick; Panzarin, Valentina",Virology journal,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-019-1223-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31752912/,208190716.0

Limited data exist regarding these associations in unselected cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) patients. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of CICU patients between January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2015, with a hemoglobin (Hb) level measured at admission. Multivariable regression was performed to determine predictors of hospital mortality, and Kaplan–Meier analysis was used to determine post-discharge survival. RESULTS: We included 9644 patients with a mean age of 67.5 ± 15.1 years, including 3604 (37.4%) females. The median (IQR) values of Hb, MCV and RDW were 12.2 g/dL (10.6, 13.7), 90.7 fL (87.3, 94.2) fL, and 14.1% (13.3, 15.8), respectively. Anemia (admission Hb < 12 g/dL) was present in 4434 (46%) patients. A total of 845 (8.8%) patients died in the hospital. Patients with anemia had higher hospital mortality (11.3% vs. 6.6%, unadjusted OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.58–2.10, p < 0.001). After multivariable regression, admission Hb and MCV were not significantly associated with hospital mortality (both p > 0.1), while admission RDW (adjusted OR 1.12 per 1%, 95% CI 1.07–1.18, p < 0.001) was significantly associated with hospital mortality. Hospital survivors with lower Hb, higher MCV, or higher RDW had lower post-discharge survival. CONCLUSION: Elevated RDW on admission was independently associated with higher hospital mortality in CICU patients. These data emphasize the importance of hematologic abnormalities for mortality risk stratification in CICU populations.

Among the farms, Farm A showed a high antibody incidence. We could not confirm if either TGEV or porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) induced the antibodies, since conventional tests failed to discriminate PRCV from TGEV. Therefore, we conducted virological and serological examinations of this farm for 4 years to establish the etiology - TGEV or PRCV. Although no TGEV was detected, PRCVs were isolated from the nasal samples of pigs. Using a commercial ELISA kit, it was found that the antibodies detected in pigs of all the raising stages and sows were raised against PRCV but not TGEV. The phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the isolates showed that they were closely related to each other, and formed a separate cluster apart from the U.S.A. and European strains. In Cesarean-derived, colostrums-deprived piglets inoculated with a PRCV isolate, no clinical signs were seen, and the viruses were mainly isolated from the nasal samples. Moreover, viral genes were detected from the nasal sample of the contact pig. The result suggested that PRCV infection was located in the nasal cavity of pigs, and horizontal transmission easily occurs. From these results, PRCVs with different origins from the exotic PRCVs might be prevalent in pig farms in Japan.",2008,"Usami, Yoshihide; Fukai, Katsuhiko; Ichikawa, Yutaka; Okuda, Yo; Shibata, Isao; Motoyama, Chihiro; Imai, Kunitoshi; Kirisawa, Rikio",The Journal of veterinary medical science,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18840967/,19247372.0

Processing of the polyprotein, however, is not an all-or-nothing process in which endopeptidases act as simple peptide cutters. On the contrary, spatial-temporal modulation of these polyprotein cleavage events is crucial for a successful viral infection.

Published series report a complication rate ranging from 3% to 40% for this procedure. Historically, many dural substitutes have been used, including bovine grafts, human cadaveric pericardium, synthetic dura, and autologous pericranium. The authors hypothesized that a recently observed increase in complications was dependent on the graft used. METHODS Between January 2004 and January 2008, 114 consecutive patients ≤ 18 years old underwent primary CM-I decompression using duraplasty. Records were retrospectively reviewed for short- and intermediate-term complications and operative technique, focusing on the choice of duraplasty graft with or without application of a tissue sealant. RESULTS The average age of the patients was 8.6 years. The dural graft used was variable: 15 were treated with cadaveric pericardium, 12 with Durepair, and 87 with EnDura. Tisseel was used in 75 patients, DuraSeal in 12, and no tissue sealant was used in 27 patients. The overall complication rate was 21.1%. The most common complications included aseptic meningitis, symptomatic pseudomeningocele, or a CSF leak requiring reoperation. The overall complication rates were as follows: cadaveric pericardium 26.7%, Durepair 41.7%, and EnDura 17.2%; reoperation rates were 13%, 25%, and 8.1%, respectively. Prior to adopting a different graft product, the overall complication rate was 18.1%; following the change the rate increased to 35%. Complication rates for tissue sealants were 14.8% for no sealant, 18.7% for Tisseel, and 50% for DuraSeal. Nine patients were treated with the combination of Durepair and DuraSeal and this subgroup had a 56% complication rate. CONCLUSIONS Complication rates after CM-I decompression may be dependent on the dural graft with or without the addition of tissue sealant. The complication rate at the authors' institution approximately doubled following the adoption of a different graft product. Tissue sealants used in combination with a dural substitute to augment a duraplasty may increase the risk of aseptic meningitis and/or CSF leak. The mechanism of the apparent increased inflammation with this combination remains under investigation.",2011,"Parker, Stephen R; Harris, Peggy; Cummings, Thomas J; George, Timothy; Fuchs, Herbert; Grant, Gerald",Journal of neurosurgery.

ljd4w9mp,,WHO,Football is “the most important of the least important things”: The Illusion of Sport and COVID-19,,,,unk,"In his book, On the Pleasure Principle in Culture (2014), Robert Pfaller argued that our relationship to sport is one grounded in “illusion”. Simply put, our interest in and enjoyment of sport occurs through a process of “knowing better”. Here, one’s knowledge of the unimportance of sport is achieved by associating the illusion of sport with a naïve observer–i.e. someone who does believe in sport’s importance. In the wake of the global pandemic, COVID-19, it would seem that Pfaller’s remarks have taken on an added significance. With major sporting events and domestic competitions being indefinitely postponed or canceled, Liverpool manager, Jürgen Klopp, commented that football was “the most important of the least important things”.

The primary aims of this study were to examine the relationship of physical therapy visit frequency and duration in the hospital with patients’ mobility status at discharge and probability of discharging home. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients with COVID-19 admitted to any of eleven hospitals in one health system. The primary outcome was mobility status at discharge, measured using the Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care 6-Clicks basic mobility (6-Clicks mobility) and the Johns Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility (JH-HLM) scales. Discharge to home vs. to a facility was a secondary outcome. Associations between these outcomes and physical therapy visit frequency or mean duration were tested using multiple linear or modified Poisson regression. Potential moderation of these relationships by particular patient characteristics was examined using interaction terms in subsequent regression models. RESULTS: For the 312 patients included, increased physical therapy visit frequency was associated with higher 6-Clicks mobility (b = 3.63; 95% CI = 1.54–5.71) and JH-HLM scores (b = 1.15; 95% CI = 0.37–1.93) at hospital discharge and with increased probability of discharging home (adjusted relative risk = 1.82; 95% CI = 1.25–2.63). Longer mean visit duration was also associated with improved mobility at discharge and the probability of discharging home, though the effects were less pronounced. Few moderation effects were observed. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID-19 demonstrated improved mobility at hospital discharge and higher probability of discharging home with increased frequency and longer mean duration of physical therapy visits. These associations were not generally moderated by patient characteristics. IMPACT: Physical therapy should be an integral component of care for patients hospitalized due to COVID-19.

BACKGROUND CLI is an advanced form of peripheral arterial disease associated with nonhealing arterial ulcers and high rates of MACCE and major amputation. Although statin medications are recommended for secondary prevention in peripheral arterial disease, their effectiveness in CLI is uncertain. METHODS We reviewed 380 CLI patients who underwent diagnostic angiography or therapeutic endovascular intervention from 2006 through 2012. Propensity scores and inverse probability of treatment weighting were used to adjust for baseline differences between patients taking and not taking statins. RESULTS Statins were prescribed for 246 (65%) patients. The mean serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level was lower in patients prescribed statins (75 ± 28 mg/dl vs. 96 ± 40 mg/dl, p < 0.001). Patients prescribed statins had more baseline comorbidities including diabetes, coronary artery disease, and hypertension, as well as more extensive lower extremity disease (all p values <0.05). After propensity weighting, statin therapy was associated with lower 1-year rates of MACCE (stroke, myocardial infarction, or death; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28 to 0.99), mortality (HR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.97), and major amputation or death (HR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.35 to 0.98). Statin use was also associated with improved lesion patency among patients undergoing infrapopliteal angioplasty.

It is unclear if the impact from shoes in younger children is similar to what has been seen in older children. This systematic review aims to identify any impact of shoe features on younger children's gait, and if there are any differences between shoe sole flexibility compared to barefoot. Methods Study inclusion criteria included: typically developing children aged ≤6 years; comparison of barefoot and shod conditions (walking and/or running) with shoe features or style of shoe described; sample size > 1. Novelty types of footwear were excluded, as was any mention of in shoe support or modifications. Studies were located from six databases. Study methodology was assessed using the McMasters critical review form. Sample size weighted standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Results Four studies were included. Participant age ranged from 15.2 to 78.7 months, with 262 participants across all studies. All studies had limited methodological bias based on their design type. Compared to barefoot walking, shoes increased velocity, step time and step length. Shod walking decreased cadence. Peak plantar pressure was generally lower in the stiff shoe design and there was a higher peak plantar pressure in the Ultraflex shoes. No studies were found investigating muscle activation. Conclusions Shoes affect younger children's gait in spatiotemporal gait aspects, similar to those seen in older children. There is limited evidence on effects of particular shoe features such as sole hardness, on gait, and no evidence of any changes in muscle activation patterns. Further research is required to evaluate the impact of different types of shoe and shoe features in this population to provide clinical advice on the type of shoe that is appropriate in this age group.",2019,"Cranage, Simone; Perraton, Luke; Bowles, Kelly-Ann; Williams, Cylie",Journal of foot and ankle research,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13047-019-0365-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31798689/,208355967.0

Under steady state conditions, brain DC’s act as sentinels, continually sampling their local environment. They share this function with macrophages derived from the same basic hemopoietic (bone marrow-derived) precursor and with parenchymal microglia that arise from a unique non-hemopoietic origin. While multiple cells may serve as antigen presenting cells (APCs), dendritic cells present both foreign and self-proteins to naïve T cells that, in turn, carry out effector functions that serve to protect or destroy. The resulting activation of the adaptive response is a critical step to resolution of injury or infection and is key to survival.

The induction of antigen-specific mucosal and systemic immune response at the site of virus entry is a major challenge for vaccine design. Here, we designed a strategy for noninvasive receptor mediated gene delivery to nasal resident DCs. The pDNA loaded biotinylated chitosan nanoparticles were prepared using a complex coacervation process and characterized for size, shape, surface charge, plasmid DNA loading and protection against nuclease digestion. The pDNA loaded biotinylated chitosan nanoparticles were targeted with bifunctional fusion protein (bfFp) vector for achieving DC selective targeting. The bfFp is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of truncated core-streptavidin fused with anti-DEC-205 single chain antibody (scFv). The core-streptavidin arm of fusion protein binds with biotinylated nanoparticles, while anti-DEC-205 scFv imparts targeting specificity to DC DEC-205 receptor. We demonstrate that intranasal administration of bfFp targeted formulations along with anti-CD40 DC maturation stimuli enhanced magnitude of mucosal IgA as well as systemic IgG against N protein. The strategy led to the detection of augmented levels of N protein specific systemic IgG and nasal IgA antibodies. However, following intranasal delivery of naked pDNA no mucosal and systemic immune responses were detected. A parallel comparison of targeted formulations using intramuscular and intranasal routes showed that the intramuscular route is superior for induction of systemic IgG responses compared with the intranasal route. Our results suggest that targeted pDNA delivery through a noninvasive intranasal route can be a strategy for designing low-dose vaccines.",2012,"Raghuwanshi, Dharmendra; Mishra, Vivek; Das, Dipankar; Kaur, Kamaljit; Suresh, Mavanur R",Molecular pharmaceutics,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1021/mp200553x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22356166/,32432866.0

In the face of this medical challenge threatening humans, the development of rapid and accurate methods for early screening and diagnosis of COVID-19 became crucial to containing the emerging public health threat, and prevent further spread within the population. Despite the large number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in China, some problematic cases with inconsistent laboratory testing results, were reported. Specifically, a high false-negative rate of 41% on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) detection by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays was observed in China. Although serological testing has been applied worldwide as a complementary method to help identify SARS-CoV-2, several limitations on its use have been reported in China. Therefore, the use of both qRT-PCR and serological testing in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in China and elsewhere, presented considerable challenges, but when used in combination, can be valuable tools in the fight against COVID-19. In this review, we give an overview of the advantages and disadvantages of different molecular techniques for SARS-CoV-2 detection that are currently used in several labs, including qRT-PCR, gene sequencing, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), nucleic acid mass spectrometry (MS), and gene editing technique based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas13) system.

METHODS: This was a retrospective review of emergency imaging volumes from January 5 to May 30, 2020. Weekly volume data were collected for total imaging studies, abdominopelvic CT, and abdominopelvic CTs positive for common causes of acute nontraumatic abdominal pain. Two emergency radiology attendings scored all diverticulitis cases independently, and weekly volume data for uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis cases was also collected. Volume data prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic was compared, using 2019 volumes as a control. RESULTS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, overall emergency imaging volume decreased 30% compared to 2019 (p = 0.002). While the number of emergency abdominopelvic CTs positive for appendicitis and small bowel obstruction did not significantly change during the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of cases of diverticulitis decreased significantly compared to 2019 (p = 0.001). This reduction can be specifically attributed to decreased uncomplicated diverticulitis cases, as the number of uncomplicated diverticulitis cases dropped significantly (p = 0.002) while there was no significant difference in the number of complicated diverticulitis cases (p = 0.09). CONCLUSIONS: Reduced emergency abdominopelvic CT volume during the COVID-19 pandemic can partially be explained by decreased imaging of lower acuity patients. This data may help formulate future strategies for imaging resource utilization with an improved understanding of the relationship between perceived imaging risk and symptom acuity.",2020,"Gibson, Averi L; Chen, Byron Y; Rosen, Max P; Paez, S Nicolas; Lo, Hao S",Emerg Radiol,,#893290,,,,,225080963.0

This ex-post regression analysis of the German power market from 2016 to 2019 investigates the contribution of each factor to the CO(2) emissions reduction. The results suggest that short-term market developments for gas prices are responsible for a major share of 2019’s CO(2) emissions reduction when compared to 2018 levels. The sustainable transition of the power system, in form of adequate CO(2) prices and additional renewable energy capacities, becomes the dominating factor when analyzing the CO(2) emissions reductions over the longer time span from 2016 to 2019.

LGBTQ individuals also experience higher rates of discrimination, victimization, and minority stress which can complicate posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment but also represent independent intervention targets. In this review, we highlight existing evidence-based practices, current limitations, and provide recommendations for care in the absence of established guidelines for treatment PTSD among LGBTQ patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Trauma-focused therapies (e.g., CPT, PE) and medications (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs) have shown benefit for people with PTSD. However, evaluations of these interventions have failed to examine the role of LGBTQ identities in recovery from trauma, and existing PTSD treatments do not account for ongoing threat to safety or the pervasive minority stress experienced by LGBTQ patients. In addition, many LGBTQ patients report negative experiences with healthcare, necessitating increased education and cultural awareness on the part of clinicians to provide patient-centered care and, potentially, corrective mental health treatment experiences. SUMMARY: Providers should routinely assess trauma exposure, PTSD, and minority stress among LGBTQ patients. We provide assessment and screening recommendations, outline current evidence-based treatments, and suggest strategies for integrating existing treatments to treat PTSD among LGBTQ patients.",2020-03-16,"Livingston, Nicholas A.; Berke, Danielle; Scholl, James; Ruben, Mollie; Shipherd, Jillian C.",Curr Treat Options Psychiatry,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c716670dccb5ce20ab6777887b1c6dc18cd1ecd1.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7223966.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223966/,

The first step in SARS-CoV-2 infection is binding of the virus to ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) on the airway epithelium. Objectives: The objective was to gain insight into the expression of ACE2 in the human airway epithelium. Methods: Airway epithelia sampled by fiberoptic bronchoscopy of trachea, large airway epithelia (LAE), and small airway epithelia (SAE) of nonsmokers and smokers were analyzed for expression of ACE2 and other coronavirus infection–related genes using microarray, RNA sequencing, and 10x single-cell transcriptome analysis, with associated examination of ACE2-related microRNA. Measurements and Main Results: 1) ACE2 is expressed similarly in the trachea and LAE, with lower expression in the SAE; 2) in the SAE, ACE2 is expressed in basal, intermediate, club, mucus, and ciliated cells; 3) ACE2 is upregulated in the SAE by smoking, significantly in men; 4) levels of miR-1246 expression could play a role in ACE2 upregulation in the SAE of smokers; and 5) ACE2 is expressed in airway epithelium differentiated in vitro on air–liquid interface cultures from primary airway basal stem/progenitor cells; this can be replicated using LAE and SAE immortalized basal cell lines derived from healthy nonsmokers.

The literature consulted indicates that healthcare workers, who are the first to respond, are generally the ones who pay the highest price. The present study assesses the extent of anxious and depressive symptoms among these actors responding to COVID-19, in the context of Cameroon. METHOD: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess anxious and depressive symptoms. Data collection involved the use of a web questionnaire for this purpose through the Google Forms virtual platform. The questionnaire link was sent to professional groups spread throughout Cameroon's ten regions. A total of 331 health professionals were interviewed over the period from April 5 to 19, 2020. RESULT: The results show a high rate of anxiety (41.8%) and depression (42.8%). There is a higher susceptibility to depression in young people (30-39 years). Fear of contamination and fear of death are modulators of depression and anxiety. The anxiety-depression comorbidity in the sample is 14.73%. The prevalence rates of major depressive disorder and adjustment disorder in the sample were 8.2% and 3.3%, respectively. The data presented confirm the trends recorded in the literature regarding the impact of fatal epidemics on the mental health of healthcare workers. DISCUSSION: The results indicate, as is the case with most of the work consulted in the literature, that the Covid 19 pandemic is significantly affecting the mental health of healthcare workers. This underlines the urgency of setting up a specialized aid and / or support system, in the context of the current pandemic, such as that of similar health crises. Such a device does not exist in Cameroon, where the mental health response remains weak. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the healthcare staff involved in the response to COVID-19 in Cameroon are significantly affected in their mental health.

Though the pathogenicity of emerging H7N9 influenza virus in several animal models has been reported, these studies have not included a detailed characterization of the host response following infection. Therefore, we characterized the transcriptomic response of BALB/c mice infected with H7N9 (A/Anhui/01/2013) virus and compared it to the responses induced by H5N1 (A/Vietnam/1203/2004), H7N7 (A/Netherlands/219/2003), and pandemic 2009 H1N1 (A/Mexico/4482/2009) influenza viruses. We found that responses to the H7 subtype viruses were intermediate to those elicited by H5N1 and pdm09H1N1 early in infection but that they evolved to resemble the H5N1 response as infection progressed. H5N1, H7N7, and H7N9 viruses were pathogenic in mice, and this pathogenicity correlated with increased transcription of cytokine response genes and decreased transcription of lipid metabolism and coagulation signaling genes. This three-pronged transcriptomic signature was observed in mice infected with pathogenic H1N1 strains such as the 1918 virus, indicating that it may be predictive of pathogenicity across multiple influenza virus strains. Finally, we used host transcriptomic profiling to computationally predict drugs that reverse the host response to H7N9 infection, and we identified six FDA-approved drugs that could potentially be repurposed to treat H7N9 and other pathogenic influenza viruses. IMPORTANCE Emerging avian influenza viruses are of global concern because the human population is immunologically naive to them. Current influenza drugs target viral molecules, but the high mutation rate of influenza viruses eventually leads to the development of antiviral resistance. As the host evolves far more slowly than the virus, and influenza pathogenesis is determined in part by the host response, targeting the host response is a promising approach to treating influenza. Here we characterize the host transcriptomic response to emerging H7N9 influenza virus and compare it with the responses to H7N7, H5N1, and pdm09H1N1. All three avian viruses were pathogenic in mice and elicited a transcriptomic signature that also occurs in response to the legendary 1918 influenza virus. Our work identifies host responses that could be targeted to treat severe H7N9 influenza and identifies six FDA-approved drugs that could potentially be repurposed as H7N9 influenza therapeutics.",2014,"Morrison, Juliet; Josset, Laurence; Tchitchek, Nicolas; Chang, Jean; Belser, Jessica A; Swayne, David E; Pantin-Jackwood, Mary J; Tumpey, Terrence M; Katze, Michael G",Journal of virology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00570-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24991006/,13496413.0

Indeed, there is a correlation between the numbers of confirmed cases with a 2-3 weeks lag. In contrast, Jordan has the ability to seal its borders and better contain the spread of the virus. We then discuss comparative public health aspects in relation to the management of COVID-19 and long term adaptation to climate change.

METHODS The study cohort comprised 708 consecutive male patients with clinically localized prostate cancer who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (n = 551) or robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (n = 157) between January 1999 and September 2012. Operative time, estimated blood loss, complications, and positive surgical margins frequency were compared between laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. RESULTS There were no significant differences in age or body mass index between the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients. Prostate-specific antigen levels, Gleason sum and clinical stage of the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients were significantly higher than those of the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy patients. Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients suffered significantly less bleeding (P < 0.05). The overall frequency of positive surgical margins was 30.6% (n = 167; 225 sites) in the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group and 27.5% (n = 42; 58 sites) in the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy group. In the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group, positive surgical margins were detected in the apex (52.0%), anterior (5.3%), posterior (5.3%) and lateral regions (22.7%) of the prostate, as well as in the bladder neck (14.7%).

However, some experimental and clinical studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in influenza virus infections is associated with excessive host response including a cell-mediated immune reaction. During the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza A virus infections in Korea, we experienced a dramatic effect of immune-modulators (corticosteroids) on the patients with severe pneumonia who had significant respiratory distress at presentation and those who showed rapidly progressive pneumonia during oseltamivir treatment. We also found that the pneumonia patients treated with corticosteroids showed the lowest lymphocyte differential and that the severity of pneumonia was associated with the lymphocyte count at presentation. From our findings and previous experimental and clinical studies, we postulated that hyperactive immune cells (T cells) may be involved in the acute lung injury of influenza virus infections, using a hypothesis of ‘protein homeostasis system’; the inducers of the cell-mediated immune response are initially produced at the primary immune sites by the innate immune system. These substances reach the lung cells, the main target organ, via the systemic circulation, and possibly the cells of other organs, including myocytes or central nerve system cells, leading to extrapulmonary symptoms (e.g., myalgia and rhabdomyolysis, and encephalopathy). To control these substances that may be possibly toxic to host cells, the adaptive immune reaction may be operated by immune cells, mainly lymphocytes. Hyperimmune reaction of immune cells produces higher levels of cytokines which may be associated with acute lung injury, and may be controlled by early use of immune-modulators. Early initiation and proper dosage of immune-modulators with antiviral agents for severe pneumonia patients may reduce morbidity and prevent progressive fatal pneumonia.",2011-01-31,"Lee, Kyung-Yil; Rhim, Jung-Woo; Kang, Jin-Han",Medical Hypotheses,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/8502bbc9c55829306187ff46b78832fa8af095fe.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7131389.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20822853/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987710003361; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2010.08.032; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987710003361,2933705.0

METHODS We included 10,861 patients with COVID-19 infection admitted to the Northwell Health system hospitals during the period of March 1 to April 27, 2020. BMI was classified as: underweight, normal, overweight, obesity class I, II, and III. Primary outcomes are invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and death. RESULTS There were 243 (2.2%) underweight, 2,507 (23.1%) normal weight, 4,021 (37.0%) overweight, 2,345 (21.6%) obesity class I, 990 (9.1%) obesity class II, and 755 (7.0%) obesity class III patients. Patients who are overweight (OR=1.27[95% CI, 1.11-1.46]), obesity class I (OR=1.48 [95% CI, 1.27-1.72]), obesity class II (OR=1.89[95% CI, 1.56-2.28]), and obesity class III (OR=2.31 [95% CI, 1.88-2.85]) had increased risk of requiring IMV.

Thus, impairment of kidney function has been primarily attributed to secondary effects like cytokine release or fluid balance disturbances so far. We provide evidence that SARS-CoV-2 can directly infiltrate a kidney allograft. A 69-year old male, who underwent pancreas-kidney transplantation 13 years ago presented to our hospital with COVID-19 pneumonia and impaired pancreas and kidney allograft function. Kidney biopsy was performed showing tubular damage and an interstitial mononuclear cell infiltrate. RT-PCR from the biopsy specimen was positive for SARS-CoV-2. In-situ hybridization revealed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in tubular cells and the interstitium. Subsequently, he suffered from two convulsive seizures. Magnetic resonance tomography suggested meningoencephalitis, which was confirmed by SARS-CoV-2 RNA transcripts in the cerebrospinal fluid. The patient suffered from COVID-19 pneumonia, meningoencephalitis and nephritis. SARS-CoV-2 binds to its target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which is expressed in a broad variety of tissues including the lung, brain, and kidney.

OBJECTIVE: This study documented and characterized COVID-19 cases reported in individuals receiving treatment with Pfizer pharmaceutical products and cases that reported use of Pfizer pharmaceutical products for COVID-19 treatment. METHODS: This retrospective observational review leveraged the Pfizer safety database containing adverse event data collected in association with use of Pfizer products between 1 October, 2019, and 25 June, 2020; the database includes worldwide adverse event data from various sources. Selected Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) Preferred Terms and subsequent clinical review were used to characterize COVID-19 cases. RESULTS: Over 1500 relevant cases were identified over an 8-month period. In cases that reported COVID-19, immunosuppressant/immunomodulating agents, followed by anticoagulant/antithrombic agents and corticosteroids, were the most frequently reported agents. The frequent reporting of immunosuppressant/immunomodulating agents among cases of COVID-19 suggests increased vulnerability to infection among treated patients, either because of immunosuppressive effects of certain agents or the nature of the underlying treated condition. In cases involving off-label pharmacotherapy use for the treatment of COVID-19-related conditions, the most frequently reported therapeutic classes included antibiotics, antimalarial agents, antivirals/antiretroviral agents, immunosuppressant/immunomodulating agents, corticosteroids, anticoagulants, and immunoglobulin/interferons. The most frequently reported pharmacotherapeutic agents were azithromycin and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, followed by lopinavir-ritonavir, ceftriaxone, and tofacitinib. The most frequently reported clinical adverse events associated with azithromycin (as sole therapy or combined with chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine) include electrocardiogram QT prolonged, drug interaction, hepatitis, diarrhea, and hepatitis acute. Regarding cardiac-related events, 19% (120/645) of azithromycin cases reported events associated with QT prolongation/torsade de pointes (which included seven fatal cardiac events). The most frequently reported clinical adverse events associated with other commonly used agents are also presented.

As of March 2020, 96 countries have ratified the MLC2006, covering more than 90% of the world’s shipping fleet. A system of port state control (PSC) allows ratifying countries to inspect any foreign ship arriving in their ports for compliance with the convention. It is intended as a second safety measure for the identification of substandard ships that sail all over the world. Nine regional agreements, so-called Memoranda of Understanding (MoU), have been signed to coordinate and standardize PSC inspections and to increase efficiency by sharing inspections and information. This paper uses public PSC statistics to evaluate the impact of the MLC2006. METHODS: A preliminary analysis using registered tonnage and MLC2006 ratification was conducted and seven MoU were selected for the analysis. The annual reports of these MoU have been viewed in September 2019. Numbers on annual inspections, deficiencies and detentions and in particular data for deficiencies related to living and working conditions and certificates and documents, have been extracted and analyzed for the years 2010 to 2017. RESULTS: Across the eight-year period analyzed, inspection numbers remained stable among all MoU authorities. Deficiencies overall and deficiencies related to WLC declined, indicating an improvement in conditions overall and an increased focus on seafarers’ conditions on board. After the MLC2006 entered into force, three MoU reported WLC-ratios above 14%, while the numbers didn’t rise above 10% in the other four authorities. Deficiencies related to certificates and documents did not rise significantly between 2010 and 2017. Two European MoU showed the highest ratios for deficiencies in both categories analyzed. CONCLUSION: The analysis confirmed that an increasing attention is being paid to the inspection of working and living conditions, especially in European countries. However, a clear positive impact of the MLC2006 could not be determined from the PSC statistics in this analysis. A large variation still exists among the MoU, a fact that demands increased efforts for harmonization of PSC procedures.

Although the majority of prolapse can be managed conservatively, surgical revision is required with incarceration/strangulation and in certain cases laparotomy and/or stoma reversal are not appropriate. This report will inform surgeons on safe and effective approaches to revising prolapsed stomas using local techniques. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 58 year old female with an obstructing rectal cancer previously received a diverting transverse loop colostomy. On completion of neoadjuvant treatment, re-staging found new lung metastases. She was scheduled for further chemotherapy but incarcerated a prolapsed segment of her loop colostomy. As there was no plan to resect her primary rectal tumor at the time, a local revision was preferred. Linear staplers were applied to the prolapsed stoma in step-wise fashion to locally revise the incarcerated prolapse. Post-operative recovery was satisfactory with no complications or recurrence of prolapse. DISCUSSION We detail in step-wise fashion a technique using linear stapler devices that can be used to locally revise prolapsed stoma segments and therefore avoid a laparotomy. The procedure is technically easy to perform with satisfactory post-operative outcomes. We additionally review all previous reports of local repairs and show the evolution of local prolapse repair to the currently reported technique. CONCLUSION This report offers surgeons an alternative, efficient and effective option for addressing the complications of stoma prolapse. While future studies are needed to assess long-term outcomes, in the short-term, our report confirms the safety and effectiveness of this local technique.",2016,"Monette, Margaret M; Harney, Rodney T; Morris, Melanie S; Chu, Daniel I",Annals of medicine and surgery,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2016.08.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27668078/,15518157.0

We find that misinformation, in terms of tweets containing URLs from low quality misinformation websites, is shared at a higher rate than tweets containing URLs on high quality health information websites. However, both are a relatively small proportion of the overall conversation. In contrast, news sources are shared at a much higher rate. These findings lead us to analyze the network created by the URLs referenced on the webpages shared by Twitter users. When looking at the combined network formed by all three of the source types, we find that the high quality health information network, the low quality misinformation network, and the news information network are all well connected with a clear community structure. While high and low quality sites do have connections to each other, the connections to and from news sources are more common, highlighting the central brokerage role news sources play in this information ecosystem.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed the official data of COVID-19 patients in Mexico through May 18, 2020 (released by the Secretaría de Salud de México). Adjusted logistic regression models were applied to assess the associations of comorbidities with pneumonia and death. The marginal effects were estimated, and the probability of pneumonia or death according to the number of comorbidities was graphed for each year of age. RESULTS: Of the 51 053 COVID-19 patients enrolled in the final analysis, 27 667 (54.2%) had no chronic conditions, while 13 652 (26.7%), 6518 (12.8%) and 3216 (6.3%) were reported to have 1, 2, and 3 or more simultaneous conditions, respectively. Overall, a significant incremental gradient was observed for the association between multimorbidity and pneumonia (p<0.001); for 2 chronic conditions, the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) was 2.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.95 to 2.20), and for &#8805;3 conditions, the aOR was 2.40 (95% CI, 2.22 to 2.60).

Beyond the lungs, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, can infect a range of other tissues, including the kidney, potentially contributing to acute kidney injury in those with severe disease. We hypothesized that the renal abundance of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2, the cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2, may be modulated by diabetes and agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). METHODS: The expression of ACE 2 was examined in 49 archival kidney biopsies from patients with diabetic kidney disease and from 12 healthy, potential living allograft donors using next-generation sequencing technology (RNA Seq). RESULTS: Mean ACE 2 messenger RNA was increased approximately 2-fold in diabetes when compared with healthy control subjects (mean ± SD, 13.2±7.9 vs 7.7±3.6 reads per million reads, respectively; p=0.001). No difference in transcript abundance was noted between recipients and nonrecipients of agents that block the RAAS (12.2±6.7 vs 16.2±10.7 reads per million reads, respectively; p=0.25).

Bubble continuous positive airway pressure (bCPAP) can offer effective and affordable non-invasive respiratory support. OBJECTIVE To determine the best physical components of bubble CPAP circuits for respiratory support of children in low-resource settings. METHODS Using PubMed, CINAHL and LILACS, studies of any design in any language published before June 2017 which examined the physical components of bCPAP circuits were identified and reviewed. RESULTS After screening, the review included 45 articles: 17 clinical trials, 11 literature reviews, 10 technical assessments of bCPAP components, three reports of real-world implementation in low-resource settings, three cost analyses and one case report. There is no ideal bCPAP circuit for all settings and patients, but some choices are generally better than others in designing a circuit for low-resource settings. Oxygen concentrators are usually the best source of oxygen. As yet, there is no affordable and accurate oxygen blender. Nasal prongs are the simplest patient interface to use with the fewest complications but are not the cheapest option. Expiratory limbs should be at least 1 cm in diameter. Home-made pressure generators are effective, safe and affordable.

Anti-cytokine treatments are being evaluated but optimal patient selection remains unclear, and the aim of our study is to address this point. METHODS: Between February 29 to April 6, 2020, 111 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were evaluated in a single centre retrospective study. Patients were divided in two groups: 42 severe cases (TOCI) with adverse prognostic features including raised CRP and IL-6 levels, who underwent anti-cytokine treatments, mostly tocilizumab, and 69 standard of care patients (SOC). RESULTS: In the TOCI group, all received anti-viral therapy and 40% also received glucocorticoids. In TOCI, 62% of cases were ventilated and there were 3 deaths (17.8 ± 10.6 days, mean follow up) with 7/26 cases remaining on ventilators, without improvement, and 17/26 developed bacterial superinfection. One fatality occurred in the 15 TOCI cases treated on noninvasive ventilation and 1 serious bacterial superinfection. Of the 69 cases in SOC, there was no fatalities and no bacterial complications. The TOCI group had higher baseline CRP and IL-6 elevations (p < 0.0001 for both) and higher neutrophils and lower lymphocyte levels (p = 0.04 and p = 0.001, respectively) with the TOCI ventilated patients having higher markers than non-ventilated TOCI patients. CONCLUSION: Higher inflammatory markers, more infections and worse outcomes characterized ventilated TOCI cases compared to ward based TOCI.

hmn5uym6,,WHO,Morphological and physiological properties of Rohon-Beard neurons along the zebrafish spinal cord,,,,unk,"Primary mechanosensory neurons play an important role in converting mechanical forces into the sense of touch. In zebrafish, Rohon-Beard (RB) neurons serve this role at embryonic and larval stages of development. Here we examine the morphology and physiology of RBs in larval zebrafish to better understand how mechanosensory stimuli are represented along the spinal cord. We report that the morphology of RB neurons differs along the rostrocaudal body axis. Rostral RB neurons arborize in the skin near the cell body whereas caudal cells arborize at a distance posterior to their cell body. Using a novel electrophysiological approach, we also found longitudinal differences in the mechanosensitivity and physiological properties of RB neurons. Rostral RB neurons respond to mechanical stimulations close to the soma and produce up to three spikes with increasing stimulus intensity, whereas caudal cells respond at more distal locations and can produce four or more spikes when the intensity of the mechanical stimulus increases. The mechanosensory properties of RB neurons are consistent with those of rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors and can signal the onset, offset and intensity of mechanical stimulation. This is the first report of the intensity encoding properties of RB neurons, where an increase in spike number and a decrease in spike latency are observed with increasing stimulation intensity. This study reveals an unappreciated complexity of the larval zebrafish mechanosensory system and demonstrates how differences in the morphological and physiological properties of RBs related to their rostrocaudal location can influence the signals that enter the spinal cord.",2020,"Katz, Hilary R; Menelaou, Evdokia; Hale, Melina E",J. comp. neurol,,#32935362,,,,,221747085.0

For Austrian cities, depending on location and topography, heavy rainfall events, storms and heat waves in particular could become increasingly relevant in the tourism context. For medium-sized and large cities, heat is the most frequently discussed topic in connection with possible adaptation potentials. The analysis of challenges shows a strong overlap of adaptation targets in city tourism with adaptation challenges for city planning including connection to the sub-urban surrounding areas to confront climate change impacts. Covid-19 pandemic, additionally, offered the opportunity to discuss a new re-start of the city-tourism against the experience during the shutdown period in spring 2020. The paper argues that we can learn from the current health crisis for coping with climate change related extreme events and to increase achievements in climate change mitigation. Firstly, the pandemic provides a strong ability to discuss the impact of city tourism due to short-term air travel and options to enhance more climate-friendly options on the other hand. Secondly, Covid-19 emphasized the need to reconsider the role of free spaces in metropolitan areas as well as their accessibility. Herewith synergies with climate change adaptation are likely when questioning the availability and accessibility of green and blue infrastructure as well as their capacities. Challenges including crowding and impacts by over tourism on public free spaces will require joint strategies involving all public and private institutions (including local communities and businesses) responsible for the maintenance of green and blue free spaces. Thirdly, the strong interactions between urban and suburban areas became evident once more, which will also be very relevant for city tourism in the future (e.g. in times of heat waves). Reflection on the transferability of coping with such crowding effects, related to the adaptive behaviour of residents and tourists in times of severe heat waves, might be relevant for both city tourism and summer tourism destinations near metropolitan areas. Finally, the Covid-19 crisis encourages discussions on over-tourism in metropolitan destinations in favour of a more balanced approach, in particular in inner city areas and around major sightseeing attractions.",2020-09-30,"Jiricka-Pürrer, Alexandra; Brandenburg, Christiane; Pröbstl-Haider, Ulrike",Journal of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/2dea189ead65d66343b6e9a365c1ce5c7630ed72.json,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213078020300530; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213078020300530,221796339.0

OBJECTIVE We explored the clinical management of inpatients with COVID-19 in Italy. METHODS A self-administered survey was sent by email to Italian physicians caring for adult patients with COVID-19. A panel of experts was selected according to their clinical curricula and their responses were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 1,215 physicians completed the survey questionnaire (17.4% response rate). Of these, 188 (15.5%) were COVID-19 experts. Chest computed tomography was the most used method to detect and monitor COVID-19 pneumonia. Most of the experts managed acute respiratory failure with CPAP (56.4%), high flow nasal cannula (18.6%), and non-invasive mechanical ventilation (8%), while an intensivist referral for early intubation was requested in 17% of the cases. Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed as an antiviral in 90% of cases, both as monotherapy (11.7%), and combined with protease inhibitors (43.6%) or azithromycin (36.2%). The experts unanimously prescribed low-molecular-weight heparin to patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and half of them (51.6%) used a dose higher than standard. The respiratory burden in patients who survived the acute phase was estimated as relevant in 28.2% of the cases, modest in 39.4%, and negligible in 9%. CONCLUSIONS In our survey some major topics, such as the role of non-invasive respiratory support and drug treatments, show disagreement between experts, likely reflecting the absence of high-quality evidence studies.

Relevant articles were compiled by searching plant names combined with keywords describing antiviral activity. The antiviral effect is direct, with prominent activity against enveloped viral species. Initial stages of the viral life cycle are the most affected, as these plants appear to be targeting mainly viral structures responsible for attachment to target cells. In case of HIV, there is some activity against key enzymes in the viral life cycle. Even in the case of drug resistance, there is an equal susceptibility to applied herbal preparations.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of nebulised surfactant in COVID-19 adult patients requiring mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. TRIAL DESIGN: This study is a dose-escalating randomized open-label clinical trial of 20 COVID-19 patients. PARTICIPANTS: This study is conducted in two centres: University Hospital Southampton and University College London Hospitals. Eligible participants are aged &#8805;18, hospitalised with COVID-19 (confirmed by PCR), who require endotracheal intubation and are enrolled within 24 hours of mechanical ventilation. For patients unable to consent, assent is obtained from a personal legal representative (PerLR) or professional legal representative (ProfLR) prior to enrolment. The following are exclusion criteria: imminent expected death within 24 hours; specific contraindications to surfactant administration (e.g. known allergy, pneumothorax, pulmonary hemorrhage); known or suspected pregnancy; stage 4 chronic kidney disease or requiring dialysis (i.e., eGFR < 30); liver failure (Child-Pugh Class C); anticipated transfer to another hospital, which is not a study site, within 72 hours; current or recent (within 1 month) participation in another study that, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent enrollment for safety reasons; and declined consent or assent. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention: The study is based on an investigational drug/device combination product. The surfactant product is Bovactant (Alveofact®), a natural animal derived (bovine) lung surfactant formulated as a lyophilized powder in 108 mg vials and reconstituted to 45 mg/mL in buffer supplied in a prefilled syringe. It is isolated by lung lavage and, by weight, is a mixture of: phospholipid (75% phosphatidylcholine, 13% phosphatidylglycerol, 3% phosphatidylethanolamine, 1% phosphatidylinositol and 1% sphingomyelin), 5% cholesterol, 1% lipid-soluble surfactant-associated proteins (SP-B and SP-C), very low levels of free fatty acid, lyso-phosphatidylcholine, water and 0.3% calcium. The Drug Delivery Device is the AeroFact-COVID&#8482; nebulizer, an investigational device based on the Aerogen® Solo vibrating mesh nebulizer. The timing and escalation dosing plans for the surfactant are as follows. Cohort 1: Three patients will receive 10 vials (1080 mg) each of surfactant at dosing times of 0 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours. 2 controls with no placebo intervention. Cohort 2: Three patients will receive 10 vials (1080 mg) of surfactant at dosing times of 0 hours and 8 hours, and 30 vials (3240 mg) at a dosing time of 24 hours. 2 controls with no placebo intervention. Cohort 3: Three patients will receive 10 vials (1080 mg) of surfactant at a dosing time of 0 hours, and 30 vials (3240 mg) at dosing times of 8 hours and 24 hours. 2 controls with no placebo intervention. Cohort 4: Three patients will receive 30 (3240 mg) vials each of surfactant at dosing times of 0 hours, 8 hours and 24 hours. 2 controls. 2 controls with no placebo intervention. The trial steering committee, advised by the data monitoring committee, will review trial progression and dose escalation/maintenance/reduction after each cohort is completed (48-hour primary outcome timepoint reached) based on available feasibility, adverse event, safety and efficacy data. The trial will not be discontinued on the basis of lack of efficacy. The trial may be stopped early on the basis of safety or feasibility concerns. Comparator: No placebo intervention. All participants will receive usual standard of care in accordance with the local policies for mechanically ventilated patients and all other treatments will be left to the discretion of the attending physician. MAIN OUTCOMES: The co-primary outcome is the improvement in oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 ratio) and pulmonary ventilation (Ventilation Index (VI), where VI = [RR x (PIP - PEEP) × PaCO2]/1000) at 48 hours after study initiation. The secondary outcomes include frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), Adverse Device Effects (ADEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Serious Adverse Device Events (SADEs), change in pulmonary compliance, change in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) requirement of ventilatory support at 24 and 48 hours after study initiation, clinical improvement defined by time to one improvement point on the ordinal scale described in the WHO master protocol (2020) recorded while hospitalised, days of mechanical ventilation, mechanical ventilator free days (VFD) at day 21, length of intensive care unit stay, number of days hospitalised and mortality at day 28. Exploratory end points will include quantification of SARS-CoV-2 viral load from tracheal aspirates using PCR, surfactant dynamics (synthesis and turnover) and function (surface tension reduction) from deep tracheal aspirate samples (DTAS), surfactant phospholipid concentrations in plasma and DTAS, inflammatory markers (cellular and cytokine) in plasma and DTAS, and blood oxidative stress markers. RANDOMISATION: After informed assent, patients fulfilling inclusion criteria will be randomised to 3:2 for the treatment and control arms using an internet-based block randomization service (ALEA tool for clinical trials, FormsVision BV) in combination with electronic data collection. Randomisation will be done by the recruiting centre with a unique subject identifier specific to that centre. BLINDING (MASKING): This is an open-labelled unblinded study. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The total sample size is 20 COVID-19 mechanically ventilated patients (12 intervention; 8 control).

Although SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19) is primarily respiratory in nature, multiple studies confirmed its genetic material could be detected in the feces of infected individuals, thereby highlighting sewage as a potential indicator of community incidence or prevalence. Numerous wastewater surveillance studies subsequently confirmed detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater and wastewater-associated solids/sludge. However, the methods employed in early studies vary widely so it is unclear whether differences in reported concentrations reflect true differences in epidemiological conditions, or are instead driven by methodological artifacts. The current study aimed to compare the performance of virus recovery and detection methods, detect and quantify SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in two Southern Nevada sewersheds from March–May 2020, and better understand the potential link between COVID-19 incidence/prevalence and wastewater concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. SARS-CoV-2 surrogate recovery (0.34%–55%) and equivalent sample volume (0.1 mL–1 L) differed between methods and target water matrices, ultimately impacting method sensitivity and reported concentrations. Composite sampling of influent and primary effluent resulted in a ∼10-fold increase in concentration relative to corresponding grab primary effluent samples, presumably highlighting diurnal variability in SARS-CoV-2 signal. Detection and quantification of four SARS-CoV-2 genetic markers (up to ∼10(6) gene copies per liter), along with ratios of SARS-CoV-2 to pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), exhibited comparability with public health data for two sewersheds in an early phase of the pandemic.

7kou9itc,,WHO,Management of Advanced Chronic Kidney Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Suggestions From the Canadian Society of Nephrology COVID-19 Rapid Response Team,,,,unk,"Purpose of program: To provide guidance on the management of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) not requiring kidney replacement therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sources of information: Program-specific documents, pre-existing, and related to COVID-19; documents from national and international kidney agencies; national and international webinars, including webinars that we hosted for input and feedback; with additional information from formal and informal review of published academic literature. Methods: Challenges in the care of patients with advanced CKD during the COVID-19 pandemic were highlighted within the Canadian Senior Renal Leaders Forum discussion group. The Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN) developed the COVID-19 rapid response team (RRT) to address these challenges. They identified a lead with expertise in advanced CKD who identified further nephrologists and administrators to form the workgroup. A nation-wide survey of advanced CKD clinics was conducted. The initial guidance document was drafted and members of the workgroup reviewed and discussed all suggestions in detail via email and a virtual meeting. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The document was reviewed by the CSN COVID-19 RRT, an ethicist and an infection control expert. The suggestions were presented at a CSN-sponsored interactive webinar, attended by 150 kidney health care professionals, for further peer input. The document was also sent for further feedback to experts who had participated in the initial survey. Final revisions were made based on feedback received until April 28, 2020. Canadian Journal of Kidney Health and Disease (CJKHD) editors reviewed the parallel process peer review and edited the manuscript for clarity. Key findings: We identified 11 broad areas of advanced CKD care management that may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) clinic visit scheduling, (2) clinic visit type, (3) provision of multidisciplinary care, (4) bloodwork, (5) patient education/support, (6) home-based monitoring essentials, (7) new referrals to multidisciplinary care clinic, (8) kidney replacement therapy, (9) medications, (10) personal protective equipment, and (11) COVID-19 risk in CKD. We make specific suggestions for each of these areas. Limitations: The suggestions in this paper are expert opinion, and subject to the biases associated with this level of evidence. To expedite the publication of this work, a parallel review process was created that may not be as robust as standard arms’ length peer-review processes. Implications: These suggestions are intended to provide guidance for advanced CKD directors, clinicians, and administrators on how to provide the best care possible during a time of altered priorities and reduced resources.",2020,"White, Christine A.; Kappel, Joanne E.; Levin, Adeera; Moran, Sarah M.; Pandeya, Sanjay; Thanabalasingam, Susan J.",Can.

Data comes from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), a probability-based online survey panel representative of the US adult population. The analytic sample consisted of 9,687 individuals with no prior history of a mental health condition who completed the survey between March 19-24, 2020. Explanatory variables included sociodemographic factors and items related to behavior, perceptions, and experiences surrounding the pandemic. The outcome was psychological distress, measured by five items on symptoms of anxiety, depression, loneliness, sleep difficulties, and hyperarousal. A multivariable linear regression model was used to identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress. Fifteen percent of the sample experienced 2 psychological distress symptoms for at least 3 days over the past week; 13% had three or more symptoms.

These plasmids are constructed as cassettes that harbor genes involved in replication and its control, mobilization, resistance determinants and one or two origins of lagging strand synthesis. Any given plasmid may contain all, some, or just only the replication cassette. We discuss here the family of the promiscuous streptococcal plasmid pMV158, with emphasis on its mobilization functions: the product of the mobM gene, prototype of the MOB(V) relaxase family, and its cognate origin of transfer, oriT. Amongst the subfamily of MOB(V1) plasmids, three groups of oriT sequences, represented by plasmids pMV158, pT181, and p1414 were identified. In the same subfamily, we found four types of single-strand origins, namely ssoA, ssoU, ssoW, and ssoT. We found that plasmids of the rolling-circle Rep_2 family (to which pMV158 belongs) are more frequently found in Lactobacillales than in any other bacterial order, whereas Rep_1 initiators seemed to prefer hosts included in the Bacillales order. In parallel, MOB(V1) relaxases associated with Rep_2 initiators tended to cluster separately from those linked to Rep_1 plasmids. The updated inventory of MOB(V1) plasmids still contains exclusively mobilizable elements, since no genes associated with conjugative transfer (other than the relaxase) were detected. These plasmids proved to have a great plasticity at using a wide variety of conjugative apparatuses. The promiscuous recognition of non-cognate oriT sequences and the role of replication origins for lagging-strand origin in the host range of these plasmids are also discussed.",2014-06-02,"Lorenzo-Díaz, Fabián; Fernández-López, Cris; Garcillán-Barcia, M.

Insufficient attention has been given to the challenge posed by the 2019 novel coronavirus to legislatures, the vital organ of democracy. This article develops a comprehensive analysis of the multiple ways in which the pandemic challenges legislatures and their operation, drawing on illustrative examples from various countries around the world. It argues that covid-19 poses a unique and complex challenge for legislatures; resulting from the characteristics of this pandemic and the ways they interact with the fundamental institutional features of legislatures; the typical demographic traits of legislators; the psychological biases that can prejudice legislatures’ ability to evaluate the risk; and the effects of emergencies on legislatures. The article then delves into an in-depth case study analysis of Israel to analyze how the pandemic particularly challenges parliaments in countries where covid-19 coincides with a pre-existing political crisis. By understanding the complex challenges posed by covid-19 on parliaments, we can help ensure that parliaments, and perhaps ultimately democracy itself, would not become casualties of covid-19.",2020,"Bar-Siman-Tov, Ittai",Theo.

A machine learning algorithm was developed in order to identify a subpopulation of COVID-19 patients for whom hydroxychloroquine was associated with improved survival; this population might be relevant for study in a clinical trial. A pragmatic trial was conducted at six United States hospitals. We enrolled COVID-19 patients that were admitted between 10 March and 4 June 2020. Treatment was not randomized. The study endpoint was mortality; discharge was a competing event. Hazard ratios were obtained on the entire population, and on the subpopulation indicated by the algorithm as suitable for treatment. A total of 290 patients were enrolled. In the subpopulation that was identified by the algorithm, hydroxychloroquine was associated with a statistically significant (p = 0.011) increase in survival (adjusted hazard ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11–0.75). Adjusted survival among the algorithm indicated patients was 82.6% in the treated arm and 51.2% in the arm not treated.

Interleukins (IL) -35 and IL-37 are newly discovered cytokines that play an important role in suppressing the immune system. However, the expression of these interleukins in patients with Madurella mycetomatis (M. mycetomatis) induced eumycetoma has not yet been explored. The aim of this study is to determine the levels of IL-1 family (IL-1β, IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in a group of these patients and the association between these cytokines levels and the patients’ demographic characteristics. The present, case-control study was conducted at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Soba University Hospital, University of Khartoum, Sudan and it included 140 individuals. They were divided into two groups; group I: healthy controls [n = 70; median age 25 years (range 12 to 70 years)]. Group II: mycetoma patients [n = 70 patients; median age 25 (range 13 to 70 years)]. Cytokines levels were measured in sera using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There was a significant negative correlation between IL-1β and IL-12 levels and lesion size and disease duration, while IL-37 and IL-35 levels were significantly positively correlated with both lesion size and disease duration. The analysis of the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of mycetoma showed a negative significant association with IL-1β cytokine, where a unit increment in IL-1β will decrease the levels of IL-37 by 35.28 pg/ml. The levels of IL-37 among the patients with a duration of mycetoma infection ≤ 1 year were significantly low by an average of 18.45 pg/ml compared to patients with a mycetoma infection’s duration of ≥ 5years (reference group). Furthermore, the risk factors of higher levels of IL-35 in mycetoma patients revealed a negative significant association with IL-12, as a unit increment in IL-12 decreases the levels of IL-35 by 8.99 pg/ml (p < 0.001). Levels of IL-35 among the patients with duration of mycetoma infection ≤ one year were significantly low on average by 41.82 pg/ml (p value = 0.002) compared to patients with a duration of mycetoma infection ≥ 5 years (reference group).

The transmembrane protein CD26 with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) activity shows an increased expression in inflamed tissue. We tested whether CD26/DPP4 deficiency leads to reduced inflammation and decreased structural damage when infected with PA. METHODS: CD26/DPP4(+) and CD26/DPP4(−) rats were instilled intratracheally with NaCl (controls) or with PA. Six hours later, bacterial distribution was detected with the in vivo imaging system 200 (IVIS). Lungs were then processed for molecular biology, light and electron microscopy and analyzed qualitatively, quantitatively and stereologically. Bacterial numbers were determined in homogenized lungs. RESULTS: Compared to saline treated controls, in both infected groups (1) the acinar airspace was significantly increased, (2) the volume density of the alveolar epithelium was significantly decreased, (3) the septal thickness was significantly reduced, (4) more than 40% of the alveolar epithelial surface was damaged, and up to 36% of the epithelial surface was covered with edema. In infected CD26(−) rats, the increase in lung weight was significantly less pronounced, the portion of edematous alveolar airspace was significantly lower and the part of edema interspersed with PA was decreased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: CD26/DPP4 deficiency resulted in reduced pulmonary edema under sublethal PA infection, implicating a role for CD26 in infection progression.

Sialic acids present on the epithelial surface have long been considered to be determinants of influenza virus tropism. However, mucus which is also rich in sialic acids may serve as the first barrier of selection. It was investigated how influenza virus interacts with the mucus to infect epithelial cells. Two techniques were applied to track SIV H1N1 in porcine mucus. The microscopic diffusion of SIV particles in the mucus was analyzed by single particle tracking (SPT), and the macroscopic penetration of SIV through mucus was studied by a virus in-capsule-mucus penetration system, followed by visualizing the translocation of the virions with time by immunofluorescence staining. Furthermore, the effects of neuraminidase on SIV getting through or binding to the mucus were studied by using zanamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI), and Arthrobacter ureafaciens neuraminidase. The distribution of the diffusion coefficient shows that 70% of SIV particles were entrapped, while the rest diffused freely in the mucus. Additionally, SIV penetrated the porcine mucus with time, reaching a depth of 65 µm at 30 min post virus addition, 2 fold of that at 2 min. Both the microscopic diffusion and macroscopic penetration were largely diminished by NAI, while were clearly increased by the effect of exogenous neuraminidase. Moreover, the exogenous neuraminidase sufficiently prevented the binding of SIV to mucus which was reversely enhanced by effect of NAI. These findings clearly show that the neuraminidase helps SIV move through the mucus, which is important for the virus to reach and infect epithelial cells and eventually become shed into the lumen of the respiratory tract.",2014-10-15,"Yang, Xiaoyun; Steukers, Lennert; Forier, Katrien; Xiong, Ranhua; Braeckmans, Kevin; Van Reeth, Kristien; Nauwynck, Hans",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/6eb145a990b1132457f78c4e1521ab827b715ad0.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4198190.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0110026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25333824/,6683953.0

Although many endemic zoonoses can be treated, timely diagnosis and appropriate clinical management of human cases is often challenging. Preventive ‘One Health’ interventions, e.g. interventions in animal populations that generate human health benefits, may provide a useful approach to overcoming some of these challenges. Effective strategies, such as animal vaccination, already exist for the prevention, control and elimination of many endemic zoonoses, including rabies, and several livestock zoonoses (e.g. brucellosis, leptospirosis, Q fever) that are important causes of human febrile illness and livestock productivity losses in low- and middle-income countries. We make the case that, for these diseases, One Health interventions have the potential to be more effective and generate more equitable benefits for human health and livelihoods, particularly in rural areas, than approaches that rely exclusively on treatment of human cases. We hypothesize that applying One Health interventions to tackle these health challenges will help to build trust, community engagement and cross-sectoral collaboration, which will in turn strengthen the capacity of fragile health systems to respond to the threat of emerging zoonoses and other future health challenges. One Health interventions thus have the potential to align the ongoing needs of disadvantaged communities with the concerns of the broader global community, providing a pragmatic and equitable approach to meeting the global goals for sustainable development and supporting the global health security agenda.

Controlling the local and systemic inflammatory response in COVID-19 may be as important as anti-viral therapies. Endogenous lipid autacoid mediators, referred to as eicosanoids, play a critical role in the induction of inflammation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. SARS-CoV-2 may trigger a cell death (“debris”)-induced “eicosanoid storm”, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which in turn initiates a robust inflammatory response. A paradigm shift is emerging in our understanding of the resolution of inflammation as an active biochemical process with the discovery of novel endogenous specialized pro-resolving lipid autacoid mediators (SPMs), such as resolvins. Resolvins and other SPMs stimulate macrophage-mediated clearance of debris and counter pro-inflammatory cytokine production, a process called inflammation resolution. SPMs and their lipid precursors exhibit anti-viral activity at nanogram doses in the setting of influenza without being immunosuppressive. SPMs also promote anti-viral B cell antibodies and lymphocyte activity, highlighting their potential use in the treatment of COVID-19. Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) inhibitors stabilize arachidonic acid-derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), which also stimulate inflammation resolution by promoting the production of pro-resolution mediators, activating anti-inflammatory processes, and preventing the cytokine storm. Both resolvins and EETs also attenuate pathological thrombosis and promote clot removal, which is emerging as a key pathology of COVID-19 infection. Thus, both SPMs and sEH inhibitors may promote the resolution of inflammation in COVID-19, thereby reducing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other life-threatening complications associated with robust viral-induced inflammation. While most COVID-19 clinical trials focus on “anti-viral” and “anti-inflammatory” strategies, stimulating inflammation resolution is a novel host-centric therapeutic avenue. Importantly, SPMs and sEH inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for other inflammatory diseases and could be rapidly translated for the management of COVID-19 via debris clearance and inflammatory cytokine suppression. Here, we discuss using pro-resolution mediators as a potential complement to current anti-viral strategies for COVID-19.",2020-05-08,"Panigrahy, Dipak; Gilligan, Molly M.; Huang, Sui; Gartung, Allison; Cortés-Puch, Irene; Sime, Patricia J.; Phipps, Richard P.; Serhan, Charles N.; Hammock, Bruce D.",Cancer Metastasis Rev,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/eac1fb5c5fb0a27c858d7fa25fcfbb000b29d079.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7207990.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10555-020-09889-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32385712/,218552598.0

In 2017, urban neuropsychologists and a pediatrician practicing in a rural region of New Mexico started to develop a teleneuropsychology (TeleNP) consultation service model to efficiently triage and determine a clinical course of action. This pilot project, aimed at expanding clinical access to specialized pediatric services in rural areas, evolved over the course of 2 years prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. METHOD: Providers earned the trust of the local community, gained understanding of pertinent sociocultural factors, and acquired knowledge of the clinical and educational concerns for the children residing in the rural community. The application of a culturally informed approach that highlights the importance of community participation and collaboration steered the decision to implement a TeleNP consultation model. By widening access to neuropsychology, this service helped to determine whether neuropsychological testing procedures were medically indicated. RESULTS: We summarize the distinct processes that needed to occur at each location to support the implementation of telemedicine. We propose a clinical service decision tree with specific criteria to help guide providers on how to triage cases in order to increase access to specialized healthcare.

xf1fmgtl,,Medline,Barriers to public health management of a pertussis outbreak in Arkansas.,,,14757606.0,unk,"BACKGROUND During the 2001-2002 respiratory season, Arkansas experienced one of its worst pertussis outbreaks. This crisis occurred shortly after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. OBJECTIVE To determine whether vulnerabilities in the public health infrastructure existed in the context of emerging infectious diseases or possible bioterrorist attacks. DESIGN Key personnel involved in the Arkansas pertussis outbreak were interviewed, and health department epidemiologic data were reviewed. SETTING Observations were made for the statewide private-public management of the epidemic. PARTICIPANTS Physicians, infectious disease specialists, epidemiologists, field nurses, health department staff, laboratory staff, and administrators. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Diagnosis capability; vaccine, prophylaxis, and treatment programs; and effectiveness of global outbreak management. RESULTS Diagnosis of pertussis was a major barrier to management of the outbreak. The nonspecific clinical diagnosis, unreliability of testing methods, excessive number of samples, unavailability of reagents, and inadequate transport system, laboratory personnel, and equipment all impeded effective diagnosis. Vaccine shortage was not believed to contribute to the extent of the outbreak. Prophylaxis was problematic because of feared adverse effects of drugs and uncertainty about the efficacy of new drugs, but compliance was found to be good. From a public health perspective, isolation procedures, school absence policies, and health department referrals to private physicians all contributed to confusion. Problems with communications, staffing, and public cooperation were identified. Despite these barriers, the epidemic was well tolerated, with no known mortality and limited morbidity. CONCLUSIONS Despite many identified barriers to effective public health management, Arkansas tolerated its worst epidemic of pertussis in many years.

Methods According to the clinical characteristics and initial laboratory findings of 175 suspected cases defined by the WHO criteria (20 confirmed as cases of SARS) in 3 university teaching hospitals in Taipei between March 1 and April 20, 2003, the scoring system for SARS was designed by multivariate analysis and stepwise logistic regression as the simple arithmetic sum of point values assigned to 7 parameters. We thereafter applied the scoring system for SARS to the consecutive 232 patients (the validation group) who met the WHO criteria of suspected cases from April 21 to May 22, 2003. Final diagnosis of SARS was determined by the results of real-time polymerase chain reaction and paired serum. Results The scoring system for SARS was defined as radiographic findings of multilobar or bilateral infiltrates (3 points), sputum monocyte predominance (3 points), lymphocytopenia (2 points), history of exposure (1 point), lactate dehydrogenase more than 450 U/L (1 point), C-reactive protein more than 5.0 mg/dL (1 point), and activated partial prothrombin time more than 40 seconds (1 point). Of the validation group, 60 patients (group A) were confirmed as having cases of SARS, and the other 172 (group B) patients tested negative for SARS. The total points of the scoring system for SARS at initial presentation were significantly higher in the SARS group (median 9; range 6 to 11) than in the non-SARS group (median 4; range 3 to 7; P<.001). At the cutoff value of 6 points, the sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system for SARS in diagnosing SARS were 100% and 93%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of the scoring system for SARS were 83% and 100%, respectively.

Susceptibility to stress can entail damaging behaviours, a common problem in pig production. Breeding animals with increased stress resilience is difficult for various reasons. First, studies on neuroendocrine and behavioural stress responses in farm animals are scarce, as it is difficult to record adequate phenotypes under field conditions. Second, damaging behaviours and stress susceptibility are complex traits, and their biology is not yet well understood. Dissecting complex traits into biologically better defined, heritable and easily measurable proxy traits and developing biomarkers will facilitate recording these traits in large numbers. High-throughput molecular technologies (""omics"") study the entirety of molecules and their interactions in a single analysis step. They can help to decipher the contributions of different physiological systems and identify candidate molecules that are representative of different physiological pathways. Here, we provide a general overview of different omics approaches and we give examples of how these techniques could be applied to discover biomarkers.

Assessing the effectiveness of China's current policies on imported cases abroad is very important for China and other countries that are facing or will face overseas imported cases. In April, we used a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model to simulate the epidemic in seven foreign countries, China and the three Chinese key cities. Based on the model outside China, we estimated the proportion of people in incubation period and calculated the risk indexes for Chinese cities through analyzing aviation traffic data from these countries. Based on the model in China and the three key cities, we collected information on control measures and quantified the effectiveness of implementing the current policies at different times and intensities. Our model results showed that Shanghai, Beijing, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and Tianjin have the top five risk indexes. As of April 20, 2020, under current measures, the number of confirmed cases could be reduced by 99% compared with no air traffic restrictions and isolation measures; the reduction could be 93% with isolation of passengers only from key countries.

Objective To elucidate the association between reperfusion and brain edema. The secondary objectives were to evaluate whether brain edema could partially be responsible for worse outcomes in patients with later reperfusion or lower Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a post hoc analysis of the Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN), which was a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial of endovascular treatment compared with conventional care of patients with acute anterior circulation ischemic stroke. Of 502 patients enrolled from December 2010 to June 2014, 2 patients declined to participate. Additionally, exclusion criteria were absence of follow-up imaging or presence of parenchymal hematoma, resulting in 462 patients included in this study. Brain edema was assessed retrospectively, from December 10, 2016, to July 24, 2017, by measuring midline shift (MLS) in all available follow-up scans. Observers were blinded to clinical data. Main Outcomes and Measures Midline shift was assessed as present or absent and as a continuous variable. Reperfusion status was assessed by the modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score in the endovascular treatment arm. The modified arterial occlusive lesion score was used to evaluate the recanalization status in both arms. The modified Rankin scale score at 90 days was used for functional outcome. Results Of 462 patients, the mean (SD) age was 65 (11) years, and 41.8% (n = 193) were women. Successful reperfusion and recanalization were associated with a reduced likelihood of having MLS (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.12-0.53; P < .001 and adjusted common odds ratio, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.21-0.55; P < .001, respectively). Midline shift was partially responsible for worse modified Rankin scale scores in patients without reperfusion or recanalization (MLS changed the logistic regression coefficients by 30.3% and 12.6%, respectively). In patients with delayed reperfusion or lower Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score, MLS mediated part of the worse modified Rankin scale scores, corresponding to a change in the regression coefficient of 33.3% and 64.2%, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance Successful reperfusion was associated with reduced MLS. This study identifies an additional benefit of reperfusion in relation to edema, as well as rescuing ischemic brain tissue at risk for infarction.

kqcdclqb,,WHO,Managing patient flows in radiation oncology during the COVID-19 pandemic : Reworking existing treatment designs to prevent infections at a German hot spot area University Hospital,,,,unk,"PURPOSE: The described work aimed to avoid cancellations of indispensable treatments by implementing active patient flow management practices and optimizing infrastructure utilization in the radiation oncology department of a large university hospital and regional COVID-19 treatment center close to the first German SARS-CoV­2 hotspot region Heinsberg in order to prevent nosocomial infections in patients and personnel during the pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study comprised year-to-date intervention analyses of in- and outpatient key procedures, machine occupancy, and no-show rates in calendar weeks 12 to 19 of 2019 and 2020 to evaluate effects of active patient flow management while monitoring nosocomial COVID-19 infections. RESULTS: Active patient flow management helped to maintain first-visit appointment compliance above 85.5%. A slight appointment reduction of 10.3% daily (pâ¯= 0.004) could still significantly increase downstream planning CT scheduling (pâ¯= 0.00001) and performance (pâ¯= 0.0001), resulting in an absolute 20.1% (pâ¯= 0.009) increment of CT performance while avoiding overbooking practices. Daily treatment start was significantly increased by an absolute value of 18.5% (pâ¯= 0.026). Hypofractionation and acceleration were significantly increased (pâ¯= 0.0043). Integrating strict testing guidelines, a distancing regimen for staff and patients, hygiene regulations, and precise appointment scheduling, no SARS-CoV­2 infection in 164 tested radiation oncology service inpatients was observed. CONCLUSION: In times of reduced medical infrastructure capacities and resources, controlling infrastructural time per patient as well as optimizing facility utilization and personnel workload during treatment evaluation, planning, and irradiation can help to improve appointment compliance and quality management. Avoiding recurrent and preventable exposure to healthcare infrastructure has potential health benefits and might avert cross infections during the pandemic. Active patient flow management in high-risk COVID-19 regions can help Radiation Oncologists to continue and initiate treatments safely, instead of cancelling and deferring indicated therapies.",2020,"Akuamoa-Boateng, Dennis; Wegen, Simone; Ferdinandus, Justin; Marksteder, Regina; Baues, Christian; Marnitz, Simone",Strahlenther.

A substantial minority of patients hospitalized develop an acute COVID-19 cardiovascular syndrome, which can manifest with a variety of clinical presentations but often presents as an acute cardiac injury with cardiomyopathy, ventricular arrhythmias, and hemodynamic instability in the absence of obstructive coronary artery disease. The cause of this injury is uncertain but is suspected to be related to myocarditis, microvascular injury, systemic cytokine-mediated injury, or stress-related cardiomyopathy. Although histologically unproven, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has the potential to directly replicate within cardiomyocytes and pericytes, leading to viral myocarditis. Systemically elevated cytokines are also known to be cardiotoxic and have the potential to result in profound myocardial injury. Prior experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 has helped expedite the evaluation of several promising therapies, including antiviral agents, interleukin-6 inhibitors, and convalescent serum. Management of acute COVID-19 cardiovascular syndrome should involve a multidisciplinary team including intensive care specialists, infectious disease specialists, and cardiologists. Priorities for managing acute COVID-19 cardiovascular syndrome include balancing the goals of minimizing healthcare staff exposure for testing that will not change clinical management with early recognition of the syndrome at a time point at which intervention may be most effective.

Studies show that despite its similarities to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, there are critical differences in key RBD residues when compared to SARS-CoV-2. Here we present a short in silico study, showing that SARS-like bat coronavirus Rs3367 shares a high conservation with SARS-CoV-2 in important RBD residues for ACE2 binding: SARS-CoV-2’s Phe486, Thr500, Asn501 and Tyr505; implicated in receptor-binding strength and host-range determination. These features were not shared with other studied bat coronaviruses belonging to the betacoronavirus genus, including RaTG13, the closest reported bat coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein. Sequence and phylogeny analyses were followed by the computation of a reliable model of the RBD of SARS-like bat coronavirus Rs3367, which allowed structural insight of the conserved residues. Superimposition of this model on the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2-RBD complex revealed critical ACE2 contacts are also maintained. In addition, residue Asn488(Rs3367) interacted with a previously defined pocket on ACE2 composed of Tyr41, Lys353 and Asp355. When compared to available SARS-CoV-2 crystal structure data, Asn501(SARS-CoV-2) showed a different interaction with the ACE2 pocket.

At the time of writing, SARS-CoV-2 has infected over 5 million people worldwide. A key step in understanding the pathobiology of the SARS-CoV-2 was the identification of -converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to gain entry into host cells. ACE2 is an established component of the 'protective arm' of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system (RAAS) that opposes ACE/angiotensin II (ANG II) pressor and tissue remodelling actions. Identification of ACE2 as the entry point for SARS-CoV-2 into cells quickly focused attention on the use of ACE inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) in patients with hypertension and cardiovascular disease given that these pharmacological agents upregulate ACE2 expression in target cells. ACE2 is cleaved from the cells by metalloproteases ADAM10 and ADAM17. Steroid hormone receptors regulate multiple components of the RAAS and may contribute to the observed variation in the incidence of severe COVID-19 between men and women, and in patients with pre-existing endocrine-related disease. Moreover, glucocorticoids play a critical role in the acute and chronic management of inflammatory disease, independent of any effect on RAAS activity. Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, has emerged as a life-saving treatment in severe COVID-19.

ACE2 is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein and mediates viral entry into host cells. Herein, the membrane nanoparticles prepared from ACE2-rich cells are discovered with potent capacity to block SARS-CoV-2 infection. The membrane of human embryonic kidney-239T cell highly expressing ACE2 is screened to prepare nanoparticles. The nanomaterial termed HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs contains 265.1 ng mg−1 of ACE2 on the surface and acts as a bait to trap SARS-CoV-2 S1 in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in reduced recruitment of the viral ligand to host cells. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 S1 can translocate to the cytoplasm and affect the cell metabolism, which is also inhibited by HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs. Further studies reveal that HEK-293T-hACE2 NPs can efficiently suppress SARS-CoV-2 S pseudovirions entry into human proximal tubular cells and block viral infection with a low half maximal inhibitory concentration. Additionally, this biocompatible membrane nanomaterial is sufficient to block the adherence of SARS-CoV-2 D614G-S1 mutant to sensitive cells.

A large number of surgical patients are readmitted to hospitals other than where the primary surgery was performed, resulting in clinical decisions that do not incorporate the primary surgeon and potentially alter outcomes. This study characterizes readmission to primary vs different hospitals after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair and examines the implications with regard to mortality and cost. METHODS Patients who underwent open or endovascular aneurysm repair for AAA were identified from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Chronic Conditions Warehouse, a random 5% national sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 2005 to 2009. Outcomes for patients who underwent AAA repair and were readmitted within 30 days of initial discharge were compared based on readmission location (primary vs different hospital). RESULTS A total of 885 patients underwent AAA repair and were readmitted within 30 days. Of these, 626 (70.7%) returned to the primary facility, and 259 (29.3%) returned to a different facility. Greater distance from patient residence to the primary hospital was the strongest predictor of readmission to a different facility. Patients living 50 to 100 miles from the primary hospital were more likely to be readmitted to a different hospital compared with patients living <10 miles away (odds ratio, 8.50; P < .001). Patients with diagnoses directly related to the surgery (eg, wound infection) were more likely to be readmitted to the primary hospital, whereas medical diagnoses (eg, pneumonia and congestive heart failure) were more likely to be treated at a different hospital. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality between patients readmitted to a different or the primary hospital. Median total 30-day payments were significantly lower at different vs primary hospitals (primary, $11,978 vs different, $11,168; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS Readmission to a different facility after AAA repair is common and occurs more frequently than for the overall Medicare population. Patients travelling a greater distance for AAA repair are more likely to return to different vs the primary hospital when further care is required. For AAA repair, quality healthcare may be achieved at marginally lower cost and with greater patient convenience for selected readmissions at hospitals other than where the initial procedure was performed.",2014,"Saunders, Richard S; Fernandes-Taylor, Sara; Kind, Amy J H; Engelbert, Travis L; Greenberg, Caprice C; Smith, Maureen A; Matsumura, Jon S; Kent, K Craig",Journal of vascular surgery,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2013.12.015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24491237/,20290621.0

A troubling proportion of this decrease was among patients who typically would have been admitted to the hospital, suggesting substantial deferment of care. We sought to describe and characterize the impact of COVID-19 on hospital admissions through EDs, with a specific focus on diagnosis group, age, gender, and insurance coverage. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, observational study of aggregated third-party, anonymized ED patient data. This data included 501,369 patient visits from twelve EDs in Massachusetts from 1/1/2019-9/9/2019, and 1/1/2020-9/8/2020. We analyzed the total arrivals and hospital admissions and calculated confidence intervals for the change in admissions for each characteristic. We then developed a Poisson regression model to estimate the relative contribution of each characteristic to the decrease in admissions after the statewide lockdown, corresponding to weeks 11 through 36 (3/11/2020-9/8/2020). RESULTS: We observed a 32% decrease in admissions during weeks 11 to 36 in 2020, with significant decreases in admissions for chronic respiratory conditions and non-orthopedic needs. Decreases were particularly acute among women and children, as well as patients with Medicare or without insurance. The most common diagnosis during this time was SARS-CoV-2.

As loneliness is recognised as a major public health concern, it is therefore vital that research considers the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on loneliness to provide necessary support. But it remains unclear, who is lonely in lockdown? METHODS: This study compared sociodemographic predictors of loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using cross-cohort analyses of data from UK adults captured before the pandemic (UK Household Longitudinal Study, n = 31,064) and during the pandemic (UCL (University College London) COVID-19 Social Study, n = 60,341). RESULTS: Risk factors for loneliness were near identical before and during the pandemic. Young adults, women, people with lower education or income, the economically inactive, people living alone and urban residents had a higher risk of being lonely. Some people who were already at risk of being lonely (e.g. young adults aged 18–30 years, people with low household income and adults living alone) experienced a heightened risk during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with people living before COVID-19 emerged. Furthermore, being a student emerged as a higher risk factor during lockdown than usual. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that interventions to reduce or prevent loneliness during COVID-19 should be targeted at those sociodemographic groups already identified as high risk in previous research. These groups are likely not just to experience loneliness during the pandemic but potentially to have an even higher risk than normal of experiencing loneliness relative to low-risk groups.",2020-08-05,"Bu, F.; Steptoe, A.; Fancourt, D.",Public Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a73f890d8821c3735086fc1da0c827ca918a4ea0.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7405905.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32768621/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0033350620302742; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.06.036; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0033350620302742,220970625.0

We studied the association between maternal plasma POP concentration in early pregnancy and epigenome-wide placental DNA methylation among 260 pregnant women from the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies. RESULTS: Our analysis focused on POPs with more than 80% plasma concentrations above the limit of quantification, including 3 organochlorine pesticides (hexachlorobenzene, trans-nonachlor, p,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene), 1 polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE 47), 3 polychlorinated biphenyls (138/158, 153, 180), and 6 poly- and perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs) (perfluorodecanoic acid, perfluorohexanesulfonic acid, perfluorononanoic acid, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA)). Using 5% false discovery rate, POPs were associated with a total of 214 differentially methylated CpG sites (nominal p values ranging from 2.61 × 10(−21) to 2.11 × 10(−7)). Out of the 214 CpG sites, 24 (11%) were significantly correlated with placental expression of 21 genes. Notably, higher PFUnDA was associated with increased methylation at 3 CpG sites (cg13996963, cg12089439, cg18145877) annotated to TUSC3, and increased methylation at those 3 CpG sites was correlated with decreased expression of TUSC3 in the placenta. Increased methylation at cg18145877 (TUSC3) and decreased expression of TUSC3 were correlated with shorter birth length. Out of the 214 CpG sites, methylation at 44 CpG sites was correlated (p value < 0.10) with at least one neonatal anthropometry measure (i.e., birth weight, birth length, and head circumference). Seven CpG sites mediated (p value < 0.05) the association between PBDE 47 and neonatal anthropometry measures. Genes annotating the top differentially methylated CpG sites were enriched in pathways related to differentiation of embryonic cells (PBDE 47) and in pathways related to brain size and brain morphology (PFASs). CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation changes in the placenta were significantly associated with maternal plasma POPs concentration. The findings suggest that placental DNA methylation and gene expression mechanism may be involved in the prenatal toxicity of POPs and their association with neonatal anthropometry measures.",2020-07-13,"Ouidir, Marion; Mendola, Pauline; Buck Louis, Germaine M.; Kannan, Kurunthachalam; Zhang, Cuilin; Tekola-Ayele, Fasil",Clin Epigenetics,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/bbcbaa07d3d599c2836df9771eab8058f8f0a30c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7371466.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7371466/,

jab7sbtn,,WHO,The impact of COVID-19 in plastic surgery departments: a comparative retrospective study in a COVID-19 and in a non-COVID-19 hospital,,,,unk,"Background: COVID-19 is a new human-infecting coronavirus for which the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic. The first Italian cases occurred in February 2020: since then, there has been an exponential increase in new cases, hospitalizations and intensive care assistance demand. This new and sudden scenario led to a forced National Health System reorganization and review of welfare priorities. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of this pandemic on ordinary activities in two plastic surgery divisions in Rome, hosted in a COVID-19 and a non-COVID-19 hospital. Methods: The data of this comparative retrospective study was collected between 9 March and 9 April 2019 and the same period of 2020 from two plastic surgery units, one in a COVID-19 hospital and second in a non-COVID-19 hospital in Rome, Italy. The 2019-2020 data of the two hospitals was compared regarding the number of surgeries, post-operative dressings and first consultations performed. Results: Both units sustained a decrease in workload due to lockdown effects. Statistically significant differences for day surgery procedures (p value = 0.0047) and first consultations (p value < 0.0001) were found between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 institutes, with a drastic trend limiting non-urgent access to COVID-19 hospitals. Conclusions: The long-term effects of healthcare reshuffling in the ""COVID-19 era"" imply a delay in the diagnosis and treatment of skin cancer and cancellation of many reconstructive procedures.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients frequently require immunosuppressive therapy and are known to be at risk of opportunistic infections. AREAS COVERED: We hereby review the available literature pertaining to COVID-19 in IBD based on published consensus guidelines, expert opinions, case series, registries and reports. EXPERT OPINION: Preliminary data suggests no increase in incidence of COVID-19 in IBD patients as compared to general population. Morbidity and mortality rates attributable to COVID-19 are also similar in IBD patients as compared to general population. Though exact reason is unknown, some aspects of COVID-19 pathogenesis may explain this paradox. Medications for IBD need to be carefully reviewed during COVID-19 crisis. Steroids may need dose tapering or substitution to avoid complications based on anecdotal evidence. Endoscopic procedures for IBD maybe deferred unless absolutely necessary. General measures recommended for COVID-19 tailored to specific needs of IBD patients maybe the best way to prevent infection.

Bioinformatic analysis of coronaviral N sequences revealed two intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) at the center of the polypeptide. While both IDR structures were found in alpha, beta, and gamma-coronaviruses, the second IDR was absent in deltacoronaviruses. Two novel coronaviruses, currently placed in the Gammacoronavirus genus, appeared intermediate in this regard, as the second IDR structure could be barely discerned with a low probability of disorder. Interestingly, these two are the only coronaviruses thus far isolated from marine mammals, namely beluga whale and bottlenose dolphin, two highly related species; the N proteins of the viruses were also virtually identical, differing by a single amino acid. These two unique viruses remain phylogenetic oddities, since gammacoronaviruses are generally avian (bird) in nature. Lastly, both IDRs, regardless of the coronavirus genus in which they occurred, were rich in Ser and Arg, in agreement with their disordered structure.

We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID‐19 children with different severities and allergic status. METHODS: Data extracted from the electronical medical records, including demographics, clinical manifestations, comorbidities, laboratory and immunological results and radiological images of 182 hospitalized COVID‐19 children were summarized and analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 6 years old, ranging from 3 days to 15 years, and there were more boys (male‐female ratio about 2:1) within the studied 182 patients. Most of the children were infected by family members. Fever (43.4%) and dry cough (44.5%) were common symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations accounted for 11.0%, including diarrhea, abdominal discomfort and vomiting. 71.4% had abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) scan images, and typical signs of pneumonia were ground‐glass opacity and local patchy shadowing on admission. Laboratory results were mostly within normal ranges, and only a small ratio of lymphopenia (3.9%) and eosinopenia (29.5%) were observed. The majority (97.8%) of infected children were not severe, and 24 (13.2%) of them had asymptomatic infections. Compared to children without pneumonia(manifested as asymptomatic and acute upper respiratory infection), children with pneumonia were associated with higher percentages of the comorbidity history, symptoms of fever and cough, and increased levels of serum procalcitonin, alkaline phosphatase and serum interleukins (IL)‐2, IL‐4, IL‐6, IL‐10 and TNF‐α.There were no differences of treatments, duration of hospitalization, time from first positive to first negative nucleic acid testing and outcomes between children with mild pneumonia and without pneumonia. All the hospitalized COVID‐19 children had recovered except one death due to intussusception and sepsis. In 43 allergic children with COVID‐19, allergic rhinitis (83.7%) was the major disease, followed by drug allergy, atopic dermatitis, food allergy and asthma. Demographics and clinical features were not significantly different between allergic and non‐allergic groups. Allergic patients showed less increase in acute phase reactants, procalcitonin, D‐dimer and aspartate aminotransferase levels compared to all patients. Immunological profiles including circulating T, B and NK lymphocyte subsets, total immunoglobulin and complement levels and serum cytokines did not show any difference in allergic and pneumonia groups. Neither eosinophil counts nor serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels showed a significant correlation with other immunological measures, such as other immunoglobulins, complements, lymphocyte subsets numbers and serum cytokine levels. CONCLUSION: Pediatric COVID‐19 patients tended to have a mild clinical course. Patients with pneumonia had higher proportion of fever and cough and increased inflammatory biomarkers than those without pneumonia. There was no difference between allergic and non‐allergic COVID‐19 children in disease incidence, clinical features, laboratory and immunological findings.

One strategy to discourage the fomite-mediated spread of COVID-19 is the development of materials whose surface chemistry can spontaneously inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Silicon nitride (Si3N4), a material used in spine fusion surgery, is one such candidate because it has been shown to inactivate several bacterial species and viral strains. This study hypothesized that contact with Si3N4 would inactivate SARS-CoV-2, while mammalian cells would remain unaffected. MaterialsSARS-CoV-2 virions (2x104 PFU/mL diluted in growth media) were exposed to 5, 10, 15, and 20% (w/v) of an aqueous suspension of sintered Si3N4 particles for durations of 1, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. Before exposure to the virus, cytotoxicity testing of Si3N4 alone was assessed in Vero cells at 24 and 48 hour post-exposure times. Following each exposure to Si3N4, the remaining infectious virus was quantitated by plaque assay. ResultsVero cell viability increased at 5% and 10% (w/v) concentrations of Si3N4 at exposure times up to 10 minutes, and there was only minimal impact on cell health and viability up to 20% (w/v). However, the SARS-CoV-2 titers were markedly reduced when exposed to all concentrations of Si3N4; the reduction in viral titers was between 85% - 99.6%, depending on the dose and duration of exposure. ConclusionsSi3N4 was non-toxic to the Vero cells while showing strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. The viricidal effect increased with increasing concentrations of Si3N4 and longer duration of exposure.

ko8owym3,,WHO,Genetically modified live attenuated vaccine: a potential strategy to combat visceral leishmaniasis,,,,unk,"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by a protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani mainly influencing the population of tropical and subtropical regions across the globe. The arsenal of drugs available is limited, and prolonged use of such drugs makes parasite to become resistant. Therefore, it is very imperative to develop a safe, cost-effective and inexpensive vaccine against VL. Although in recent years many strategies have been pursued by researchers, but so far only some of the vaccine candidates reached for clinical trial and more than half of them are still in pipeline. There is now a broad consent among Leishmania researchers that the perseverance of parasite is very essential for eliciting a protective immune response and may perhaps be attained by live attenuated parasite vaccination. For making a live attenuated parasite it is very essential to ensure that the parasite is deficient of virulence and should further study genetically modified parasites to perceive the mechanism of pathogenesis. So it is believed that in the near future, a complete understanding of the Leishmania genome will explore clear strategies to discover a novel vaccine. This review describes the need for a genetically modified live attenuated vaccine against VL, and obstacles associated with its development.",2020,"Pandey, Satish Chandra; Kumar, Awanish; Samant, Mukesh",Parasite Immunol,,#32418227,,,,,218680451.0

We aim to identify the prevalence and prognostic significance of delirium as the sole onset manifestation of COVID-19. Methods: This is a retrospective single-centre study based on review of medical charts, conducted during the outbreak peak (March 27-April 18, 2020) in a Lombard dementia facility, including 59 elderly subjects with dementia and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Findings: Of the 59 residents, 57 (96â 6%) tested positive (mean age: 82â 8; women: 66â 7%). Comorbidities were present in all participants, with 18/57 (31â 6%) having three or more concomitant diseases. Delirium-Onset COVID-19 (DOC) was observed in 21/57 (36â 8%) subjects who were chiefly older (mean age: 85â 4 y/o) and with multiple comorbidities. Eleven/21 DOC patients (52â 4%) had hypoactive delirium, while hyperactive delirium occurred in ten/21 (47â 6%). Lymphopenia was present in almost all subjects (median: 1â 3 × 109/L). Overall mortality rate was 24â 6% (14/57) and dementia severity per se had no impact on short-term mortality due to COVID-19. DOC was strongly associated with higher mortality (p<0â 001). Also, DOC and male gender were independently associated with increased risk of mortality (OR: 17â 0, 95% CI: 2â 8-102â 7, p = 0â 002 and 13â 6, 95% CI: 2â 3-79â 2, p = 0â 001 respectively). Interpretation: Delirium occurrence in the elderly with dementia may represent a prodromal phase of COVID-19, and thus deserves special attention, especially in the presence of lymphopenia.

Among them, many service operations, which require customers to travel and visit a place indoor, become almost infeasible to run in a crowded city like Hong Kong. Motivated by a recent reported real case on an innovative service operation in Hong Kong, we build analytical models to explore how logistics and technologies together can transform the ""static service operations"" to become the ""bring-service-near-your-home"" mobile service operations. We also highlight how the government may provide the subsidy to support the above mentioned mobile service operation (MSO) to make it financially viable. We specifically show that the government may adopt the fixed-cost-subsidy (FCS) scheme, operations-cost-subsidy (OCS) scheme or safety-technology-support (STS) scheme to help. We further uncover that the OCS scheme would bring a larger consumer surplus than the FCS scheme and is hence more preferable. In the extended models, we first study the case when service fee cannot be changed because of corona virus outbreak (CVO). We then explore the feasibility of adopting MSO in the long run as a financially self-sustainable service operation and derive the analytical conditions under which MSO is a win-win business model for both the service provider and consumers.

Within the first 24 h of life, 27 test calves were experimentally challenged with C. parvum oocysts and 3 control calves were sham dosed. Test calves received 1 of 8 possible doses (25, 50, 100, 500, 1 × 10(3), 1 × 10(4), 1 × 10(5), and 1 × 10(6) oocysts). All 27 test calves developed diarrhea. Fecal oocyst shedding occurred in 25 (92.6%) test calves and in 0 control calves. The 2 non-shedding test calves both received 25 oocysts. There was an inverse relationship between dose and time to onset of fecal oocyst shedding (P = 0.005). There was no relationship found between dose and duration (P = 0.2) or cessation (P = 0.3) of fecal oocyst shedding. In addition, there was not a significant relationship between log-dose and the log-peak oocysts (P = 0.2) or log-total oocysts (P = 0.5) counted/g of feces across the dose groups. There was a positive dose–response relationship between log-dose and diarrhea (P = 0.01). However, when controlling for other factors, such as onset and cessation of fecal oocyst shedding, dose was not a significant predictor of diarrhea (P = 0.5). Onset and cessation of fecal oocyst shedding were found to be the best predictors of diarrhea (P = 0.0006 and P = 0.04, respectively). The ID(50) for fecal oocyst shedding was 5.8 oocysts, for diarrhea was 9.7 oocysts, and for fecal oocyst shedding with diarrhea was 16.6 oocysts.

The involvement of T cell immunity in this exacerbation remains unclear. To identify predictive markers of COVID-19 progress and outcome, we analyzed peripheral blood of 10 COVID-19-associated ARDS patients and 35 mild/moderate COVID-19 patients, not requiring intensive care. Using multi-parametric flow cytometry, we compared quantitative, phenotypic, and functional characteristics of circulating bulk immune cells, as well as SARS-CoV-2 S-protein-reactive T cells between the two groups. ARDS patients demonstrated significantly higher S-protein-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells compared to non-ARDS patients. Of interest, comparison of circulating bulk T cells in ARDS patients to non-ARDS patients demonstrated decreased frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets, with activated memory/effector T cells expressing tissue migration molecule CD11a++. Importantly, survival from ARDS (4/10) was accompanied by a recovery of the CD11a++ T cell subsets in peripheral blood. Conclusively, data on S-protein-reactive polyfunctional T cells indicate the ability of ARDS patients to generate antiviral protection. Furthermore, decreased frequencies of activated memory/effector T cells expressing tissue migratory molecule CD11a++ observed in circulation of ARDS patients might suggest their involvement in ARDS development and propose the CD11a-based immune signature as a possible prognostic marker.",2020,"Anft, Moritz; Paniskaki, Krystallenia; Blazquez-Navarro, Arturo; Doevelaar, Adrian; Seibert, Felix S; Hölzer, Bodo; Skrzypczyk, Sarah; Kohut, Eva; Kurek, Julia; Zapka, Jan; Wehler, Patrizia; Kaliszczyk, Sviatlana; Bajda, Sharon; Thieme, Constantin J; Roch, Toralf; Konik, Margarethe Justine; Berger, Marc Moritz; Brenner, Thorsten; Kölsch, Uwe; Meister, Toni L; Pfaender, Stephanie; Steinmann, Eike; Tempfer, Clemens; Watzl, Carsten; Dolff, Sebastian; Dittmer, Ulf; Abou-El-Enein, Mohamed; Westhoff, Timm H; Witzke, Oliver; Stervbo, Ulrik; Babel, Nina",Mol Ther,,#837386,,,,,222213299.0

A QSAR model is developed by correlating the information obtained from chemical structures (numerical descriptors/independent variables) with the experimental response values (the dependent variable). METHODS In the current study, we have developed a QSAR model to predict inhibitory activity of small molecule carboxamides against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3CLpro enzyme. Due to the structural similarity of this enzyme with that of SARS-CoV-2, the causative organism of the recent pandemic, the former may be used for development of therapies against corona virus disease 19 (COVID-19). RESULTS The final multiple linear regression (MLR) model was based on four two-dimensional descriptors with definite physicochemical meaning. The model was strictly validated using different internal and external quality metrics. The model showed significant statistical quality in terms of determination cofficient (R20.748, adjusted R2(R2adj 0.700), cross-validated leave-one-out Q2(Q20.628 and external predicted variance (R2pred 0.723). The final validated model was used for the prediction of external set compounds as well as to virtually design a new library of small molecules. We have also performed docking analysis of the most active and least active compounds present in the data set for comparative analysis and to explain the features obtained from the 2D-QSAR model.

In humans, the major classes of host defence peptides include the α- and β-defensins and the cathelicidin, hCAP-18/LL-37. These peptides are expressed in the granules of neutrophils and by a wide variety of tissue types. They have many roles in the immune response including both indirect and direct antimicrobial activity, the ability to act as chemokines as well as induce chemokine production leading to recruitment of leukocytes to the site of infection, the promotion of wound healing and an ability to modulate adaptive immunity. It appears that many of these properties are mediated though direct interaction of peptides with the cells of the innate immune response including monocytes, dendritic cells, T cells and epithelial cells. The importance of these peptides in immune responses has been demonstrated since animals defective in the expression of certain host defence peptides showgreater susceptibility to bacterial infections. In the very few instances in which human patients have been demonstrated to have defective host defence peptide expression, these individuals suffer from frequent infections.

Therapeutic strategies to target mutant-p53 cancers are urgently needed. We show that accumulated mutant-p53 protein suppresses the expression of SLC7A11, a component of the cystine/glutamate antiporter, system xC-, through binding to the master antioxidant transcription factor NRF2. This diminishes glutathione synthesis, rendering mutant-p53 tumours susceptible to oxidative damage. System xC- inhibitors specifically exploit this vulnerability to preferentially kill cancer cells with stabilized mutant-p53 protein. Moreover, we demonstrate that SLC7A11 expression is a novel and robust predictive biomarker for APR-246, a first-in-class mutant-p53 reactivator that also binds and depletes glutathione in tumours, triggering lipid peroxidative cell death.

With the spread of the virus, the global epidemic situation has become extremely serious, especially in the United States, Spain and Italy. Due to a series of control measures, the epidemic situation in Wuhan has been alleviated to a certain extent, and this region has entered into a post-epidemic period. The treatment of some acute and worsened cardiovascular diseases has become more complex because of epidemic prevention measures. Patients and Methods: We examined cardiovascular patients in the emergency department, as well as outpatient clinics and inpatient units in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, from March 20th to April 17th, 2020, as the study subjects, and we performed standard medical activities according to the principles of border treatment and border protection. Additionally, we aimed to minimize the adverse effects of the epidemic on the therapy that was administered to cardiology patients. Results: Due to this standard and feasible strategy, the cardiology department admitted a total of 97 patients, with 36 patients being discharged. No patients have been observed to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the cardiology department. In addition, we have no outpatient, caregivers or medical staff infected. Conclusion: Our study aimed to provide prevention and treatment strategies for the rapid and effective medical recovery of patients in non-COVID-19 designated hospitals in high-risk areas after remission, as well as in low- and medium-risk areas.",2020,"Fan, Qian; Chen, Xin; Lin, Yan; Wang, Zhiquan",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,,#703762,,,,,221116095.0

DESIGN Prospective surveillance of elderly people. INTERVENTION None. SETTING Leicestershire, England SUBJECTS 533 subjects 60 to 90 years of age. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Pathogens, symptoms, restriction of activity, duration of illness, medical consultations, interval between onset of illness and medical consultation, antibiotic use, admission to hospital, and death. RESULTS 231 pathogens were identified for 211 (43%) of 497 episodes for which diagnostic specimens were available: 121 (52%) were rhinoviruses, 59 (26%) were coronaviruses, 22 (9.5%) were influenza A or B, 17 (7%) were respiratory syncytial virus, 7 (3%) were parainfluenza viruses, and 3 (1%) were Chlamydia species; an adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae caused one infection each. Infections occurred at a rate of 1.2 episodes per person per annum (95% confidence interval 1.0 to 1.7; range 0-10) and were clinically indistinguishable. Lower respiratory tract symptoms complicated 65% of upper respiratory infections and increased the medical consultation rate 2.4-fold (chi 2 test P < 0.001). The median interval between onset of illness and medical consultation was 3 days for influenza and 5 days for other infections. Rhinoviruses caused the greatest disease burden overall followed by episodes of unknown aetiology, coronaviruses, influenza A and B, and respiratory syncytial virus. CONCLUSIONS Respiratory viruses cause substantial morbidity in elderly people. Although respiratory syncytial virus and influenza cause considerable individual morbidity, the burden of disease from rhinovirus infections and infections of unknown aetiology seems greater overall. The interval between onset of illness and consultation together with diagnostic difficulties raises concern regarding the role of antiviral drugs in treating influenza.",1997,"Nicholson, K G; Kent, J; Hammersley, V; Cancio, E",BMJ,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9366736/,29304376.0

The CMAH gene is thought to be present in most deuterostomes, but it has been inactivated in a number of lineages, including humans. The inability of humans to synthesize Neu5Gc has had several evolutionary and biomedical implications. Remarkably, Neu5Gc is a xenoantigen for humans, and consumption of Neu5Gc-containing foods, such as red meats, may promote inflammation, arthritis, and cancer. Likewise, xenotransplantation of organs producing Neu5Gc can result in inflammation and organ rejection. Therefore, knowing what animal species contain a functional CMAH gene, and are thus capable of endogenous Neu5Gc synthesis, has potentially far-reaching implications. In addition to humans, other lineages are known, or suspected, to have lost CMAH; however, to date reports of absent and pseudogenic CMAH genes are restricted to a handful of species. Here, we analyze all available genomic data for nondeuterostomes, and 322 deuterostome genomes, to ascertain the phylogenetic distribution of CMAH. Among nondeuterostomes, we found CMAH homologs in two green algae and a few prokaryotes. Within deuterostomes, putatively functional CMAH homologs are present in 184 of the studied genomes, and a total of 31 independent gene losses/pseudogenization events were inferred. Our work produces a list of animals inferred to be free from endogenous Neu5Gc based on the absence of CMAH homologs and are thus potential candidates for human consumption, xenotransplantation research, and model organisms for investigation of human diseases.",2017-12-30,"Peri, Sateesh; Kulkarni, Asmita; Feyertag, Felix; Berninsone, Patricia M; Alvarez-Ponce, David",Genome Biol Evol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e4ff00b9e8eec242803472b134846a7dbec01989.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5767959.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29206915/; https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evx251,30194174.0

While no vaccine or anti‐viral drugs for COVID‐19 are available, lockdown acts as a protective public health measures to reduce human interaction and lower transmission. The study aims to explore the impact of delayed planning or lack of planning for the lockdown and inadequate implementation of the lockdown, on the transmission rate of COVID‐19. METHOD: Epidemiological data on the incidence and mortality of COVID‐19 cases as reported by public health authorities were accessed from six countries based on total number of infected cases, namely, United States and Italy (more than 100 000 cases); United Kingdom, and France (50 000‐100 000 cases), and India and Russia (6000‐10 000 cases). The Bayesian inferential technique was used to observe the changes (three points) in pattern of number of cases on different duration of exposure (in days) in these selected countries 1 month after World Health Organization (WHO) declaration about COVID‐19 as a global pandemic. RESULTS: On comparing the pattern of transmission rates observed in these six countries at posterior estimated change points, it is found that partial implementation of lockdown (in the United States), delayed planning in lockdown (Russia, United Kingdom, and France), and inadequate implementation of the lockdown (in India and Italy) were responsible to the spread of infections.

Mineral and vitamin supplementation can improve the immune system and could therefore be of assistance for calves during weaning. We studied the effects of injectable (subcutaneous) supplementation with copper, zinc, selenium, manganese, and vitamins A and E. Calves were supplemented twice, before weaning and on the day of weaning. We evaluated variables related to the immune status and the immune response to a vaccine containing bovine herpesvirus type 1, as well as body weight and average daily gain. Parenteral supplementation of minerals and vitamins with antioxidant effects in a low-stress weaning system prevented the decrease in variables related to the immune system, improved antibody response, and had positive effects on body weight. ABSTRACT: We aimed to evaluate the effects of injectable mineral and vitamin supplementation on weaning calves subjected to a low-stress (fence-line) weaning system. Seven-month-old Aberdeen Angus female calves (n = 40, 152 ± 11 kg body weight) from a selenium-deficient area of extensive cattle production on natural grass were randomly assigned to two groups (n = 20 each). One group received subcutaneous supplementation with copper, zinc, selenium, manganese and vitamins A and E (SG), and the other was given sterile saline solution (CG). The animals were supplemented twice, seven days before weaning (day −7) and on the day of weaning (day 0), and they were evaluated 30 (+30) and 60 (+60) days after weaning. Total antioxidant status (TAS), selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, body weight, and average daily gain (ADG) were evaluated. Additionally, antibody titers were assessed prior to and after each immunization with a vaccine containing bovine herpes virus type 1 (BoHV-1). On day +30, body weight (p = 0.03) was higher in SG, whereas TAS (p = 0.02) and GPx (p = 0.0038) activity were lower in CG and remained constant in SG. Antibody titers increased in SG and CG following immunization, being higher in SG on days +30 and +60 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, parenteral supplementation of minerals and vitamins with antioxidant effects in a low-stress weaning system prevented the decrease in TAS and GPx activity, improved antibody response and had positive effects on body weight.",2020-07-29,"Mattioli, Guillermo Alberto; Rosa, Diana Esther; Turic, Esteban; Picco, Sebastián Julio; Raggio, Santiago José; Minervino, Antonio Humberto Hamad; Fazzio, Luis Emilio",Animals (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7a0051490557e352e9ab7c73ebb73524b0a2afe8.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7459712.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32751362/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10081298,220976582.0

We propose a novel COVID-19 management approach that is efficient in eliminating the virus load from the airways and protecting the lungs from the fatal effects of the virus. This approach relies on targeting the virus using ACE-2-functionalized gold nanorods (AuNRs) followed by irradiation with near-infrared (NIR) light for the selective eradication of SARS-CoV-2 without off-target effects, i.e., targeted plasmonic photothermal therapy. Using discrete dipole approximation (DDA), we quantitatively determined the efficiency of AuNRs (31 nm × 8 nm) in absorbing NIR when present at different orientations relative to one another on the surface of the virus. The safety and the local administration of AuNRs using a well-tolerated flexible bronchoscopy technique, commonly used for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, ensure feasibility and clinical translation.

Primary outcome was number of diagnostic radiology examinations per day compared pre- and post-COVID-19 shutdown. Univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression determined features associated with completing an examination. RESULTS: Despite resumption of nonurgent services, marked decrease in radiology examination utilization persisted in all care settings post-COVID-19 shutdown (869 examinations per day preshutdown [59,080 examinations in 68 days] versus 502 examinations per day postshutdown [19,594 examinations in 39 days]), with more significantly decreased odds ratios for having examinations in inpatient and outpatient settings versus in the emergency department. Inequities worsened, with patients from communities with high rates of poverty, unemployment, and chronic disease having significantly lower odds of undergoing radiology examinations post-COVID-19 shutdown. Patients of Asian race and Hispanic ethnicity had significantly lower odds ratios for having examinations post-COVID-19 shutdown compared with White and non-Hispanic patients, respectively.

We hypothesized that following implementation of a molecular multiplex respiratory viral panel (RVP), AECOPD patients with viral infections would be more easily identified, limiting antibiotic use in this population. The primary objective of our study was to investigate if availability of the RVP decreased antibiotic prescription at discharge among patients with AECOPD. METHODS: This is a single center, retrospective, before (pre-RVP) - after (post-RVP) study of patients admitted to a tertiary medical center from January 2013 to March 2016. The primary outcome was antibiotic prescription at discharge. Groups were compared using univariable and multivariable logistic-regression. RESULTS: A total of 232 patient-episodes were identified, 133 following RVP introduction. Mean age was 68.1 (pre-RVP) and 68.3 (post-RVP) years respectively (p = 0.88).

The dynamics of the droplets is governed by the Maxey-Riley equation with the Basset-Boussinesq history term neglected. We find that, in the absence of gravity, there are two distinct behaviors for the droplets: small droplets cannot go further than a specific distance, which we determine analytically, from the source before getting pulled into the sink. Larger droplets can travel further from the source before getting pulled into the sink by virtue of their larger inertia, and their maximum traveled distance is determined analytically. We investigate the effects of gravity, and we find that there are three distinct droplet behaviors categorized by their relative sizes: small, intermediate-sized, and large. Counterintuitively, we find that the droplets with a minimum horizontal range are neither small nor large, but of intermediate size. Furthermore, we show that in conditions of regular human respiration, these intermediate-sized droplets range in size from a few µm to a few hundred µm.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The specificity of the GPS™ CoVID‐19 dtec‐RT‐qPCR test by analysis of sequence alignments was approached and compared with other RT‐qPCR designs. The GPS™ CoVID‐19 dtec‐RT‐qPCR test was validated following criteria of UNE/EN ISO 17025:2005 and ISO/IEC 15189:2012. Diagnostic validation was achieved by two independent reference laboratories, the Instituto de Salud Carlos III, (Madrid, Spain), the Public Health England (Colindale, London, UK), and received the label CE‐IVD. The GPS design showed the highest exclusivity and passed all parameters of validation with strict acceptance criteria. Results from reference laboratories 100% correlated with these obtained by using reference methods and showed 100% of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: The CE‐IVD GPS™ CoVID‐19 dtec‐RT‐qPCR test, available worldwide with full analytical and diagnostic validation, is the more exclusive for SARS‐CoV‐2 by far. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Considering the CoVID‐19 pandemic status, the exclusivity of RT‐qPCR tests is crucial to avoid false positives due to related coronaviruses.

Although distributions of hospital length of stay (LOS) are highly skewed, a surprisingly effective summary measure is the percentage of patients previously undergoing the same category of procedure as that scheduled whose LOS was zero or one day. We evaluated how to forecast each hospital's percentage of cases with LOS of <2 days, segmented by category of surgical procedure. The large teaching hospital studied included several inpatient adult surgical suites, an ambulatory surgery center, and a pediatric surgical suite. We included 98,540 cases in a training dataset to predict 24,338 cases in a test dataset. For each category of procedure, we calculated the cumulative count of cases among quarters, from the most recent quarter, second most recent quarter, and so forth up to the quarter resulting in at least 800 cases. If every quarter combined had fewer than 800 cases for a given category of procedure, we included all cases for that category. For each combination of category and quarter, we used the cumulative counts of cases and cases with LOS of <2 days, excluding the current quarter. Then, for each category of procedure, and for each of the preceding quarters included for the category, we used the cumulative counts to calculate the asymptotic standard error (SE) for the proportion of cases with LOS of <2 days. If all preceding quarters combined provided a sample size such that the estimated SE for the proportion exceeded 1.25%, we included all preceding quarters. The observed absolute percentage error was 0.76% (SE: 0.12%). This error was nearly 100-fold smaller than the percentage of cases to which it would be used (i.e., 0.76% versus 73.1% with LOS of <2 days). The principal weakness of the forecasting methodology was a small bias caused by a progressive reduction in the overall LOS over time. However, this bias is unlikely to be important for predicting cases’ LOS when the hospital census is high. When performing these time series calculations quarterly, a reasonable approach is to perform calculations of both case counts and SEs for each category of procedure. We recommend using the fewest historical quarters, starting with the most recent quarter, either with at least 800 cases or an estimated asymptotic SE for the estimated percentage no greater than 1.25%. Applying our methodology with local LOS data will allow OR managers to estimate the number of patients on the elective OR schedule each day who will be hospitalized for longer than overnight, facilitating communication and decision-making with surgical departments when census considerations constrain the ability to run a full surgical schedule.",2020-10-08,"Dexter, Franklin; Epstein, Richard H; Shi, Pengyi",Cureus,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/72cd582807dcc7199b60c66ddc97c505c90d055b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7651771.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33178503/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10847,225125950.0
c0n8fwjm,,WHO,Many shades of wrong: what governments do when they manipulate statistics,,,,unk,"A considerable number of recent analyses report statistical evidence indicating that governments manipulate official macroeconomic indicators. Employing creative strategies to identify systematic biases in statistical outputs, these studies have shown that political manipulation of economic statistics does occur. But they have paid less attention to the question how official statistics are being manipulated. To shed light on the processes behind data manipulation, this article examines three recent high-profile cases in depth: Greece’s public deficit figures, controversies about Argentina’s inflation statistics, and the Brazilian “fiscal pedaling” scandal. We make two main contributions: first, macroeconomic indicators are much more ambiguous than it is commonly realized. Therefore, the line between accurate and manipulated data is more blurry than typical narratives about manipulation acknowledge. Second, in recognition of this ambiguity we introduce a typology distinguishing four types of manipulation: outright manipulation (type 1), politically motivated guesstimating (type 2), the opportunistic use of methodology space (type 3), and indicators-management through indirect means (type 4). The findings from our cases highlight that the politics of statistics do not revolve around “right” and “wrong” numbers. They are better understood as contestations about different shades of wrong.",2020,"Aragão, Roberto; Linsi, Lukas",Rev. Int. Polit. Econ.,,#361512,,,,,219472442.0

Robustness of the results was tested by one-way and multiway as well as probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Treatment with either neuraminidase inhibitor results in reduced morbidity and faster return to normal activities.

Although several studies have demonstrated the potential of deep learning in the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 using CT and X-ray, the generalization on unseen samples needs to be improved. To tackle this problem, we present the contrastive multi-task convolutional neural network (CMT-CNN), which is composed of two tasks. The main task is to diagnose COVID-19 from other pneumonia and normal control. The auxiliary task is to encourage local aggregation though a contrastive loss: first, each image is transformed by a series of augmentations (Poisson noise, rotation, etc.). Then, the model is optimized to embed representations of a same image similar while different images dissimilar in a latent space. In this way, CMT-CNN is capable of making transformation-invariant predictions and the spread-out properties of data are preserved. We demonstrate that the apparently simple auxiliary task provides powerful supervisions to enhance generalization. We conduct experiments on a CT dataset (4,758 samples) and an X-ray dataset (5,821 samples) assembled by open datasets and data collected in our hospital. Experimental results demonstrate that contrastive learning (as plugin module) brings solid accuracy improvement for deep learning models on both CT (5.49%-6.45%) and X-ray (0.96%-2.42%) without requiring additional annotations.

METHODS: This retrospective study included consecutive symptomatic patients who underwent chest CT and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from March 2020 to May 2020 for suspected COVID-19. Twelve readers with different levels of expertise independently scored each CT using the CO-RADS scheme for detecting pulmonary involvement by COVID-19. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were computed to investigate diagnostic yield. Fleiss’ kappa statistics was used to evaluate interreader agreement. RESULTS: A total of 572 patients (mean age, 63 ± 20 [standard deviation]; 329 men; 142 patients with COVID-19 and 430 patients without COVID-19) were evaluated. There was a moderate agreement for CO-RADS rating among all readers (Fleiss’ K = 0.43 [95% CI 0.42–0.44]) with a substantial agreement for CO-RADS 1 category (Fleiss’ K = 0.61 [95% CI 0.60–0.62]) and moderate agreement for CO-RADS 5 category (Fleiss’ K = 0.60 [95% CI 0.58–0.61]). ROC analysis showed the CO-RADS score ≥ 4 as the optimal threshold, with a cumulative area under the curve of 0.72 (95% CI 66–78%), sensitivity 61% (95% CI 52–69%), and specificity 81% (95% CI 77–84%). CONCLUSION: CO-RADS showed high diagnostic accuracy and moderate interrater agreement across readers with different levels of expertise. Specificity is higher than previously thought and that could lead to reconsider the role of CT in this clinical setting.

METHODS: Prospective sub-study of the ongoing ArcHIV cohort between May and July 2020. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were measured using the recomWell SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA (Mikrogen, Neuried, Germany); positive and borderline results were re-tested using the recomLine SARS-CoV-2 IgG immunoassay (Mikrogen, Neuried, Germany). Demographic and medical data were extracted from the electronic patient files. RESULTS: Overall, 500 people living with HIV were included in the study (83% male, median age 51 years). Three participants had been diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to study inclusion. Of those, nine were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies, resulting in an estimated seroprevalence (accounting for sensitivity and specificity of the test) of 1.5% (CI 95%: 0.69; 3.13) for the entire study sample, and 2.2% (CI 95%: 1.1; 3.9) for the subset of the Munich citizens. There were no marked differences for people living with HIV with and without SARS-CoV-2 co-infection. CONCLUSION: The seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in people living with HIV as found in our study does not seem to exceed previous reports from general populations of 'hot-sport' areas; comparative data from the Munich population can be expected to be published soon.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess whether chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin decreased COVID-19 mortality compared with the standard of care. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase Cochrane Library, Google Scholar and MedRxiv were searched up to 25 July 2020. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included published and unpublished studies comparing the mortality rate between patients treated with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin and patients managed with standard of care. PARTICIPANTS: Patients &#8805;18 years old with confirmed COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: Chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin. METHODS: Effect sizes were pooled using a random-effects model. Multiple subgroup analyses were conducted to assess drug safety. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 839 articles, of which 29 met our inclusion criteria. All studies except one were conducted on hospitalized patients and evaluated the effects of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin. Among the 29 articles, three were randomized controlled trials, one was a non-randomized trial and 25 were observational studies, including 11 with a critical risk of bias and 14 with a serious or moderate risk of bias. After excluding studies with critical risk of bias, the meta-analysis included 11 932 participants for the hydroxychloroquine group, 8081 for the hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin group and 12 930 for the control group. Hydroxychloroquine was not significantly associated with mortality: pooled relative risk (RR) 0.83 (95% CI 0.65-1.06, n = 17 studies) for all studies and RR = 1.09 (95% CI 0.97-1.24, n = 3 studies) for randomized controlled trials. Hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin was associated with an increased mortality (RR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.04-1.54, n = 7 studies). We found similar results with a Bayesian meta-analysis.

We aimed to compare the long-term risk of restenosis after these treatments and to investigate if restenosis causes stroke in a secondary analysis of the International Carotid Stenting Study (ICSS). METHODS ICSS is a parallel-group randomised trial at 50 tertiary care centres in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. Patients aged 40 years or older with symptomatic carotid stenosis measuring 50% or more were randomly assigned either stenting or endarterectomy in a 1:1 ratio. Randomisation was computer-generated and done centrally, with allocation by telephone or fax, stratified by centre, and with minimisation for sex, age, side of stenosis, and occlusion of the contralateral carotid artery. Patients were followed up both clinically and with carotid duplex ultrasound at baseline, 30 days after treatment, 6 months after randomisation, then annually for up to 10 years. We included patients whose assigned treatment was completed and who had at least one ultrasound examination after treatment. Restenosis was defined as any narrowing of the treated artery measuring 50% or more (at least moderate) or 70% or more (severe), or occlusion of the artery. The degree of restenosis based on ultrasound velocities and clinical outcome events were adjudicated centrally; assessors were masked to treatment assignment. Restenosis was analysed using interval-censored models and its association with later ipsilateral stroke using Cox regression. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN25337470. This report presents a secondary analysis, and follow-up is complete. FINDINGS Between May, 2001, and October, 2008, 1713 patients were enrolled and randomly allocated treatment (855 were assigned stenting and 858 endarterectomy), of whom 1530 individuals were followed up with ultrasound (737 assigned stenting and 793 endarterectomy) for a median of 4·0 years (IQR 2·3-5·0). At least moderate restenosis (≥50%) occurred in 274 patients after stenting (cumulative 5-year risk 40·7%) and in 217 after endarterectomy (29·6%; unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1·43, 95% CI 1·21-1·72; p<0·0001). Patients with at least moderate restenosis (≥50%) had a higher risk of ipsilateral stroke than did individuals without restenosis in the overall patient population (HR 3·18, 95% CI 1·52-6·67; p=0·002) and in the endarterectomy group alone (5·75, 1·80-18·33; p=0·003), but no significant increase in stroke risk after restenosis was recorded in the stenting group (2·03, 0·77-5·37; p=0·154; p=0·10 for interaction with treatment). No difference was noted in the risk of severe restenosis (≥70%) or subsequent stroke between the two treatment groups. INTERPRETATION At least moderate (≥50%) restenosis occurred more frequently after stenting than after endarterectomy and increased the risk for ipsilateral stroke in the overall population. Whether the restenosis-mediated risk of stroke differs between stenting and endarterectomy requires further research.

ikdexa6i,,Medline,Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis on the Use of Photon-based Stereotactic Radiosurgery Versus Fractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy for the Treatment of Uveal Melanoma.,10.1097/coc.0000000000000775,,33208706,unk,"PURPOSE The purpose of this report is to assess the efficacy and adverse event profile of photon-based stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) compared with fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (fSRT) for the treatment of uveal melanoma. Primary outcomes include incidence proportions of local control, enucleation, metastatic progression, disease-specific, and overall mortality. Treatment-related toxicities such as incidence proportions of radiation retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma, optic neuropathy, and cataract formation were examined as secondary outcomes. Five-year survival and 5-year local control rates were also assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and 2 Cochrane databases were searched up to December 31, 2018. Random effects models were used to calculate pooled incidence proportions of outcome measures. Meta-regression was carried out to explore the potential impact of dose per fraction on local control. RESULTS Twenty-four articles with a total of 1745 patients were included in the meta-analysis. There were no statistically significant differences between photon-based fSRT and SRS for all primary, secondary and 5-year outcome measures, including local control (P=0.28), enucleation (P=0.51), and neovascular glaucoma (P=0.40). The 5-year local control rate was 90% (95% confidence interval: 76%, 96%) for fSRT and 89% (70%, 97%) for SRS. CONCLUSIONS Our meta-analysis showed no difference in tumor control, survival and toxicities, as defined in this paper, between SRS and fSRT for uveal melanoma. Confounding biases remain an expected limitation in this study of novel treatment modalities deployed in rare tumors.

In this study, we have demonstrated that under nonreducing conditions the N protein forms disulfide-linked homodimers. However, inclusion of an alkylating agent (N-ethylmaleimide [NEM]) prevented disulfide bond formation, suggesting that these intermolecular disulfide linkages were formed as a result of spurious oxidation during cell lysis. In contrast, N protein homodimers isolated from extracellular virions were shown to have formed NEM-resistant intermolecular disulfide linkages, the function of which is probably to impart stability to the virion. Pulse-chase analysis revealed that N protein homodimers become specifically disulfide linked within the virus-infected cell, albeit at the later stages of infection, conceivably when the virus particle buds into the oxidizing environment of the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, NEM-resistant disulfide linkages were shown to occur only during productive PRRSV infection, since expression of recombinant N protein did not result in the formation of NEM-resistant disulfide-linked homodimers. Mutational analysis indicated that of the three conserved cysteine residues in the N protein, only the cysteine at position 23 was involved in the formation of disulfide linkages. The N protein dimer was shown to be stable both in the presence and absence of intermolecular disulfide linkages, indicating that noncovalent interactions also play a role in dimerization. Non-disulfide-mediated N protein interactions were subsequently demonstrated both in vitro by the glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay and in vivo by the mammalian two-hybrid assay. Using a series of N protein deletion mutants fused to GST, amino acids 30 to 37 were shown to be essential for N-N interactions. Furthermore, since RNase A treatment markedly decreased N protein-binding affinity, it appears that at least in vitro, RNA may be involved in bridging N-N interactions. In cross-linking experiments, the N protein was shown to assemble into higher-order structures, including dimers, trimers, tetramers, and pentamers. Together, these findings demonstrate that the N protein possesses self-associative properties, and these likely provide the basis for PRRSV nucleocapsid assembly.",2003,"Wootton, Sarah K; Yoo, Dongwan",Journal of virology,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12663761/,2603041.0

METHODS Retrospectively, 48 consecutive patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 71.0 ± 11.9 years; 24 women) treated for acute MCA occlusion using pREset solely or in combination with other MT devices were identified. Recanalization success was evaluated using the modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score (TICI), and complications were detected by 24-h follow-up computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. MCA anatomy was assessed in angiograms. Clinical outcome was evaluated with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at admission and discharge, and modified Rankin scale (mRS) score at discharge and follow-up. RESULTS Successful recanalization (TICI 2b/3) was achieved in 39 patients (81.3 %). Rate of procedure-related complications was 8.3 %. In four patients, a subarachnoid hemorrhage occurred (8.3 %), and parenchymal hematoma was detected in four patients (8.3 %). None of those events was associated with clinical deterioration. MCA curvature significantly influenced recanalization success (P < 0.005). Successful recanalization correlated significantly with lower NIHSS scores and favorable clinical outcome (mRS score 0-2) at discharge (P < 0.05). Mortality within 90 days was significantly lower in patients with TICI 2b/3 (P < 0.005).

Early detection of affected patients within the large and heterogeneous group of patients with common cold symptoms is an important element of this effort, but often hindered by limited testing resources, false-negative test results and the lack of pathognomonic symptoms in COVID-19. Therefore, we aimed to identify anamnestic items with an increased/decreased odds ratio for a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR (CovPCR) result in a primary care setting. METHODS: We performed a multi-center cross-sectional cohort study on predictive clinical characteristics for a positive CovPCR over a period of 4 weeks in primary care patients in Germany. RESULTS: In total, 374 patients in 14 primary care centers received CovPCR and were included in this analysis. The median age was 44.0 (IQR: 31.0-59.0) and a fraction of 10.7% (n = 40) tested positive for COVID-19. Patients who reported anosmia had a higher odds ratio (OR: 4.54; 95%-CI: 1.51-13.67) for a positive test result while patients with a sore throat had a lower OR (OR: 0.33; 95%-CI: 0.11-0.97).

Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most important pathogen; however, emerging resistance of this organism to antimicrobial agents has affected empirical treatment of CAP. Atypical pathogens have been quite commonly identified in several prospective studies. The clinical significance of these pathogens (with the exception of Legionella spp) is not clear, partly because of the lack of rapid, standardised tests. Diagnostic evaluation of CAP is important for appropriate assessment of severity of illness and for establishment of the causative agent in the disease. Until better rapid diagnostic methods are developed, most patients will be treated empirically. Antimicrobials continue to be the mainstay of treatment, and decisions about specific agents are guided by several considerations that include spectrum of activity, and pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles. Several factors have been shown to be associated with a beneficial clinical outcome in patients with CAP. These factors include administration of antimicrobials in a timely manner, choice of antibiotic therapy, and the use of a critical pneumonia pathway.

METHODS: Data were obtained from the ABP Certification Management System. We determined, within each subspecialty, the annual number of first-year fellows. We assessed for changes in the population using variables available throughout the study period (gender, medical school location, program region, and program size). We fit linear trendlines and calculated χ(2) statistics. RESULTS: The number of first-year pediatric medical subspecialty fellows increased from 751 in 2001 to 1445 in 2018. Fields with the growth of 3 or more fellows per year were Cardiology, Critical Care, Emergency Medicine, Gastroenterology, Neonatology, and Hematology Oncology (P value <0.05 for all).

Specific proteomic patterns might be present in serum in response to the infection and could be useful for early detection of the disease. Methods: Using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) ProteinChip technology, we profiled and compared serum proteins of 39 patients with early-stage SARS infection and 39 non-SARS patients who were suspected cases during the SARS outbreak period. Proteomic patterns associated with SARS were identified by bioinformatic and biostatistical analyses. Features of interest were then purified and identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Twenty proteomic features were significantly different between the 2 groups. Fifteen were increased in the SARS group, and 5 were decreased. Their concentrations were correlated with 2 or more clinical and/or biochemical variables. Two were correlated with the SARS-CoV viral load. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that a majority of the SARS patients (95%) had similar serum proteomic profiles and identified 2 subgroups with poor prognosis. ROC curve analysis identified individual features as potential biomarkers for SARS diagnosis (areas under ROC curves, 0.733–0.995).

tiroihqt,,WHO,COVID-19 era healthcare ethics education: Cultivating educational and moral resilience,,,,unk,"The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has had profound effects on global health, healthcare, and public health policy. It has also impacted education. Within undergraduate healthcare education of doctors, nurses, and allied professions, rapid shifts to distance learning and pedagogic content creation within new realities, demands of healthcare practice settings, shortened curricula, and/or earlier graduation have also challenged ethics teaching in terms of curriculum allotments or content specification. We propose expanding the notion of resilience to the field of ethics education under the conditions of remote learning. Educational resilience starts in the virtual classroom of ethics teaching, initially constituted as an ""unpurposed space"" of exchange about the pandemic's challenging impact on students and educators. This continuously transforms into ""purposed space"" of reflection, discovering ethics as a repertory of orientative knowledge for addressing the pandemic's challenges on personal, professional, societal, and global levels and for discovering (and then addressing) that the health of individuals and populations also has moral determinants. As such, an educational resilience framework with inherent adaptability rises to the challenge of supporting the moral agency of students acting both as professionals and as global citizens. Educational resilience is key in supporting and sustaining professional identify formation and facilitating the development of students' moral resilience and leadership amid moral complexity and potential moral transgression-not only but especially in times of pandemic.",2021,"Wald, Hedy S; Monteverde, Settimio",Nurs Ethics,,#1021288,,,,,231576428.0

We previously demonstrated that early recovery of Vδ2+ T cells inversely correlated to EBV reactivation after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Studies in vitro and in the mouse models showed the cytotoxic activity of Vδ2+ T cells on EBV-transformed lymphoproliferative cells, but the efficacy was moderate. Bisphosphonate, such as pamidronate (PAM), have been reported as a sensitizer to trigger tumor cells for Vδ2+ T cells recognition. Valproic acid (VPA) has attracted attentions due to its adjuvant anti-tumor effect with chemotherapy or immunotherapy. Whether PAM and VPA facilitate the immunogenicity of EBV-infected cells towards Vδ2+ T cells cytotoxicity remains unknown. Herein, we demonstrated that lower dosage of VPA and/or PAM did not induce apoptosis of EBV-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell lines (EBV-LCLs) or Vδ2+ T cells. Notably, pre-treatment with PAM significantly increased the cell death of EBV-LCLs after co-culture with Vδ2+ T cells at different ratios. Combining treatment with VPA reinforced the sensitizing effect of PAM. This efficacy was through inducing the accumulation of mevalonate pathway intermediates and dependent on the γδ T cell receptor of Vδ2+ T cells. Similar sensitizing effects of PAM and PAM plus VPA were also demonstrated on the primary PTLD cells. These results highlight the roles of PAM and VPA in the enhancement of immune surveillance and expand the fields of these two drugs in the treatment of different types of malignancies.",2020-08-17,"Gao, Haitao; Liu, Ruoyang; Wu, Ning; Mo, Xiao-Dong; Han, Wei; Huang, Xin; Huang, Xiao-Jun; Liu, Jiangying",International immunopharmacology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2020.106890; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818705/,221221446.0

In several purchased in-house primers/probe sets, quantification cycle values as low as 17 were measured for negative control samples. However, there were also primers/probe sets that displayed very low-level contaminations, which were detected only during thorough internal validation. Hence, it appears imperative to pre-test each batch of reagents extensively before use in routine diagnosis, to avoid false-positive results and low positive predictive value in low-prevalence situations.

As our understanding of the disease is evolving, our approach to the patient management is also changing swiftly. Available new evidence is helping us take radical decisions in COVID-19 management. We searched for inclusion of the published literature on treatment of COVID-19 from around the globe. All relevant evidences available till the time of submission of this article were briefly discussed. Once advised as blanket therapy for all patients, recent reports of hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin indicated no potential benefit and use of such combination may increase the risk of arrhythmias. Clinical evidence with newer antivirals such as remdesivir and favipiravir is promising that can hasten the patient recovery and reduce the mortality. With steroids, evidence is much clear in that it should be used in low dose and for short period not extending beyond 7 days in moderate to severe hospitalized patients. Low-molecular-weight heparin should be initiated in all hospitalized COVID-19 patients and dose should be based on the coagulation profile and risk of thromboembolism. Immunomodulatory drugs such tocilizumab may be considered for severe and critically ill patients to improve the outcomes. Though ulinastatin can be a potential alternative immunomodulator, there is lack of clinical evidence on its usage in COVID-19. Convalescent plasma therapy can be potentially lifesaving in critically ill patients. However, there is need to generate further evidence with various such therapies. Though availability of a potent vaccine is awaited, current treatment of COVID-19 is based on available therapies, which is guided by the evidence.

We have isolated cl-2-derived variant viruses resistant to neutralization by monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for the spike (S) protein of cl-2. The variants MM6 and MM13, selected by the MAbs specific for the JHMV S protein, were revealed to have a point mutation located within the N-terminal 100 amino acids (aa) of the S1 protein. The variants MM56, MM85, and MM78, selected by MAbs specific for the larger S protein of JHMV, were shown to have a deletion composed of about 150 aa located in the middle of the S1 subunit (MM56 and MM85) or one amino acid deletion, aspattic acid at number 543 from the N-terminus of the S1 (MM78). These five MAb-resistant variants were not different from cl-2 in growth pattern on cultured DBT cells. MM6 and MM13 were shown to be highly neurovirulent for 4-week-old Lewis rats, growing to high titers in the brain and causing as high an incidence of neurological disease and death as the parental cl-2. In contrast, MM56 and MM85 were nonneurovirulent for rats. They did not cause any central nervous system disorders nor did they multiply in the rat brains. MM78 showed intermediate neurovirulence as well as intermediate growth potential in the rat brain. However, there was no apparent difference in neurovirulence between the parental and the MAb-resistant variants for mice; all of these viruses showed high neurovirulence for mice. These results suggest that the domain composed of about 150 aa in the middle of the S1 is critical for high neurovirulence of JHMV for rats.

Methods and Results: The filter’s physical and viable removal efficiencies (VRE) were investigated with challenges of MS2 bacteriophage aerosols, and the infectivity of MS2 collected on the filter was analysed. To test a proposed inactivation mechanism, media containing thiosulfate or bovine serum albumin (BSA) were put in impingers to quench and consume I(2) released from the filter. In direct plating experiments, treated filters presented significantly higher VREs than did untreated filters; however, collection in excess BSA decreased VRE by half and in thiosulfate the apparent VRE decreased drastically. No significant difference in infectivity of retained viruses on treated and untreated filters was observed at the same environmental condition. Conclusions: Evidence presented herein for competition by dissolved I(2) in infectivity assays supports a mechanism of induced displacement and capture of I(2.) It also requires that dissociation of iodine from the filter and capture of iodine by MS2 aerosols as they pass through the filter be factored in the design of the assessment methodology. The filter’s strong retention capability minimizes reaerosolization but also makes it difficult to discriminate the antimicrobial effect at the surface. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study shows the direct plating assay method to be sensitive to interference by iodine‐releasing materials.

In more recent years, increasing interest in the use of local therapy for metastases likely has arisen from improvements in systemic therapy. In the absence of effective systemic therapies, such local treatments were often considered futile given both the difficulty in eliminating all sites of identifiable metastatic disease as well as realities regarding the rapid natural history of uncontrolled tumor dissemination. However, with a higher likelihood of patients surviving longer after effective systemic therapy, even if not cured, the goal of the eradication of residual metastases via potent local therapies can be rationalized. However, this rationalization should be evidence-based so as to avoid harming patients for no established benefit. Although surgical metastectomy remains the most common and first-line standard among local therapies, nonsurgical alternatives, including thermal ablation and stereotactic body radiotherapy, have become increasingly popular because they are generally less invasive than surgery and have demonstrated considerable promise in eradicating macroscopic tumor. Rather than eliminating the need for local therapies, improvements in systemic therapies appear to be increasing the prudent utilization of modern local therapies in patients presenting with more advanced cancer.",2009,"Timmerman, Robert D; Bizekis, Costas S; Pass, Harvey I; Fong, Yuman; Dupuy, Damian E; Dawson, Laura A; Lu, David",CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.20013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19364702/,25423810.0

As several pertussis cases seek care earlier, a clinical tool independent of cough duration may support earlier recognition. We developed a data-driven algorithm aimed at predicting a laboratory confirmed pertussis. METHODS: We enrolled children <12 months of age presenting with apnoea, paroxistic cough, whooping, or post-tussive vomiting, irrespective of the duration of cough. Patients underwent a RT-PCR test for pertussis and other viruses. Through a logistic regression model, we identified symptoms associated with laboratory confirmed pertussis. We then developed a predictive decision tree through Quinlan's C4.5 algorithm to predict laboratory confirmed pertussis. RESULTS: We enrolled 543 children, of which 160 had a positive RT-PCR for pertussis. A suspicion of pertussis by a physician (aOR 5.44) or a blood count showing leukocytosis and lymphocytosis (aOR 4.48) were highly predictive of lab confirmed pertussis. An algorithm including a suspicion of pertussis by a physician, whooping, cyanosis and absence of fever was accurate (79.9%) and specific (94.0%) and had high positive and negative predictive values (PPV 76.3% NPV 80.7%). CONCLUSIONS: An algorithm based on clinical symptoms, not including the duration of cough, is accurate and has high predictive values for lab confirmed pertussis. Such a tool may be useful in low resource settings where lab confirmation is unavailable, to guide differential diagnosis and clinical decisions.

Herc5, the major E3 enzyme for ISG15, mediates the ISGylation of over 300 proteins in interferon-stimulated cells. In addressing this broad substrate selectivity of Herc5, we found that: 1) the range of substrates extends even further and includes many exogenously expressed foreign proteins, 2) ISG15 conjugation is restricted to newly synthesized pools of proteins, and 3) Herc5 is physically associated with polyribosomes. These results lead to a model for ISGylation in which Herc5 broadly modifies newly synthesized proteins in a co-translational manner. This represents a novel mechanism for conjugation of a Ubl and further suggests that, in the context of an interferon-stimulated cell, newly translated viral proteins may be primary targets of ISG15.

Our primary objective was to determine whether lung ultrasound (LUS) B-lines, when excluding patients with alternative etiologies for B-lines, are more sensitive for the associated diagnosis of COVID-19 than CXR. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients who presented to a single, academic emergency department in the United States between March 20 and April 6, 2020, and received LUS, CXR, and viral testing for COVID-19 as part of their diagnostic evaluation. The primary objective was to estimate the test characteristics of both LUS B-lines and CXR for the associated diagnosis of COVID-19. Our secondary objective was to evaluate the proportion of patients with COVID-19 that have secondary LUS findings of pleural abnormalities and subpleural consolidations. RESULTS: We identified 43 patients who underwent both LUS and CXR and were tested for COVID-19. Of these, 27/43 (63%) tested positive. LUS was more sensitive (88.9%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 71.1-97.0) for the associated diagnosis of COVID-19 than CXR (51.9%, 95% CI, 34.0-69.3; p = 0.013). LUS and CXR specificity were 56.3% (95% CI, 33.2-76.9) and 75.0% (95% CI, 50.0-90.3), respectively (p = 0.453). Secondary LUS findings of patients with COVID-19 demonstrated 21/27 (77.8%) had pleural abnormalities and 10/27 (37%) had subpleural consolidations. CONCLUSION: Among patients who underwent LUS and CXR, LUS was found to have a higher sensitivity than CXR for the evaluation of COVID-19.

This study observed the expression of plasma sCD138, a soluble component shedding from the glycocalyx (GCX) to the circulating blood, and evaluated its predictive value on disease severity and prognosis of HFRS. METHODS: One hundred and seventy-six patients with HFRS who were treated at our center between January 2011 and December 2013 were randomly enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into a mild-type group, a moderate-type group, a severe-type group and a critical-type group according to the HFRS criteria for clinical classification. Thirty-five blood samples from healthy subjects were obtained as the controls. The concentrations of sCD138 were detected using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The levels of prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), fibrinogen (Fib), albumin (ALB), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), white blood cells (WBC), platelets (PLT), glucose (GLU), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Scr) in the samples were routinely tested. The levels of sCD138 among the different types were compared; the correlation among sCD138 and the laboratory parameters mentioned above were analyzed. The predictive effectiveness for prognosis of sCD138 was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Except for the mild-type, the levels of sCD138 in the moderate-, severe- and critical-type patients during the acute stage were significantly higher than that of the convalescent stage and the control (P<0.05). With the aggravation of the disease, the levels of sCD138 during the acute stage had an increasing tendency, while demonstrated no significant difference among the moderate-, severe- and critical-type patients (P>0.05). sCD138 was negatively correlated with Fib, PLT and ALB, and was positively correlated with WBC and AST (P<0.05). sCD138 demonstrated predictive effectiveness for prognosis with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.778 (P<0.001).

Pneumatic compression devices (PCDs) during HD may help maintain CBV. METHODS We performed a randomized, crossover trial to determine the effect of PCDs on CBV during HD. Patients underwent two consecutive mid-week HD sessions, randomized to begin the first session either with or without PCDs [stratified by intradialytic hypotension (IDH)-prone status]. The primary outcome was change in CBV during HD. The secondary outcomes were change in other hemodynamic and volume status parameters. RESULTS Fifty-one patients (median age 65 years, 75% male, 22% IDH-prone) were randomized; forty-six completed the study. During HD, the median change in CBV for PCD and control sessions was -0.08 versus -0.05 L (P = 0.62). There was no difference in the change in cardiac output (CO) (-0.63 versus -0.49 L/min, P = 0.78) or systemic vascular resistance (SVR) (+1.30 versus +1.55 mmHg/L/min, P = 0.67) for PCDs versus control. Based on the bioimpedance measurements, patients were not volume overloaded pre-dialysis. There was a greater reduction in total body water (TBW) (-2.6 versus -2.3 L, P = 0.05) and intracellular fluid (ICF) volume (-1.3 versus -1.1 L, P = 0.03), and no difference in change in the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume (1.3 versus 1.2 L, P = 0.09) with PCDs versus control.

Animal models are extremely important in understanding this interface as well as in bridging the gap between basic science discoveries and clinical medicine. The complex nature of pharmacological and toxicological research involving exposure to xenobiotic and therapeutic compounds necessitates the use of animal models to better understand how these compounds interact with multiple organ systems and cell types. As genomics has expanded, we have become increasingly aware of the impact an individual’s genetic makeup influences these responses. Novel methods have emerged that allow for the rapid development of animal models containing mutant alleles, allowing investigators to model these complex genetic interactions in a dramatically shortened timeline. In this chapter, we emphasize the methods and approaches that can be used in gene targeting, screening strategies, and a variety of genetically modified model organisms. The goal is to provide toxicologists an up to date review on the creation of genetically engineered animal models, which can be used to model genetic susceptibility to disease.",2018-12-31,"Veith, A.

This had led to the development of many bariatric procedures. Nevertheless, the primary surgery could fails due to several conditions. There is no standard re-operative procedure of revision for primary bariatric failure. Re-operate in the place of the primary surgery imply high rate of risks. We have developed a new procedure for revision surgery working only on not previously operated tissue. METHODS We measure the common channel from gastro- jejunal anastomosis until the ileocecal valve. Depending on the measure, we decide the length of intestine to be excluded (biliopancreatic limb and common channel). We interrupt the afferent loop before gastro-jejunostomy and the efferent loop 20 cm below the gastro-jejunostomy. For restoring the gastro-intestinal transit, we anastomose the upper part of the afferent and efferent loop side-to-side and the efferent loop segment to the upper part of the new common channel. DISCUSSION There is no standard procedure for revision of primary surgery. Even, the gold standard surgery Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is one of the most failed procedure (≤ 35%). We have developed the revision for One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass (BAGUA) working always in healthy tissue not previously used. CONCLUSIONS A few number of patients with tailored BAGUA for morbid obesity will require a surgical rescue procedure due to excess or insufficient weight loss or weight regain. This new procedure has been proven to be easy and safe, avoiding the surgical difficulties of the classical revision through the scar tissue.",2014,"Garciacaballero, Manuel; Reyes-Ortiz, Alexander; Martínez-Moreno, Manuel; Mínguez-Mañanes, Alfredo; Toval-Mata, José Antonio; Osorio-Fernández, Diego; Mata-Martín, José María",Nutricion hospitalaria,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3305/nh.2014.30.6.8121; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25433102/,43997352.0

CIPA is caused by mutations in the neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 gene (NTRK1) that encodes the high-affinity receptor of nerve growth factor (NGF). CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we present clinical and molecular findings in a 9-year-old girl with CIPA. The high-altitude indigenous Ecuadorian patient presented several health problems such as anhidrosis, bone fractures, self-mutilation, osteochondroma, intellectual disability and Riga-Fede disease. After the mutational analysis of NTRK1, the patient showed a clearly autosomal recessive inheritance pattern with the pathogenic mutation rs763758904 (Arg602*) and the second missense mutation rs80356677 (Asp674Tyr). Additionally, the genomic analysis showed 69 pathogenic and/or likely pathogenic variants in 46 genes possibly related to phenotypic heterogeneity, including the rs324420 variant in the FAAH gene. The gene ontology enrichment analysis showed 28 mutated genes involved in several biological processes. As a novel contribution, the protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that NTRK1, SPTBN2 and GRM6 interact with several proteins of the pain matrix involved in the response to stimulus and nervous system development.

An awareness of the ethical aspects of surgical practice that involve non-technical skills and judgment is of vital concern to surgical educators and encompasses disparate issues ranging from adequate supervision of trainees to surgical care access. METHODS: This bibliographical research effort seeks to report on ethical challenges from a sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) perspective as found in the peer-reviewed literature employing African Journals Online, Bioline, and other sources with African information as well as PubMed and PubMed Central. The principles of autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice offer a framework for a study of issues including: access to care (socioeconomic issues and distance from health facilities); resource utilization and decision making based on availability and cost of resources, including ICU and terminal extubation; informed consent (both communication about reasonable expectations post-procedure and research participation); research ethics, including local projects and international collaboration; quality and safety including supervision of less experienced professionals; and those religious and cultural issues that may affect any ethical decision making. The religious and cultural environment receives attention because beliefs and traditions affect medical choices ranging from acceptance of procedures, amputations, to end-of-life decisions.

AIMS To examine exposure to work-related crises and resiliency of health care workers in public hospitals in Singapore. METHODS We sent questionnaires to health care workers in seven public hospitals. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. We asked about mental health training and exposure to work-related and personal crises. We measured resiliency using a pilot 5-point Likert questionnaire reflecting resistance and resilience constructs. RESULTS We received 496 responses, a response rate of 58%. More than 70% of hospital staff experienced aggression or violence from patients and relatives, and about a third experienced significant personal crises, most commonly interpersonal conflicts. Those with mental health training were twice as likely to be resistant (OR = 1.8, 95% CI 1.2-2.7) and resilient (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 1.3-2.7) and also more likely to have experienced sudden/unexpected patient deaths (OR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.9-4.0) and aggression or violence from patients and relatives (OR = 5.1, 95% CI 3.0-8.7).

Ever since it was first detected in December 2019, the number of confirmed cases has continued to increase. Within a short period, this disease has become a global issue, and therefore it is characterized as a pandemic. The current understanding and explanations are based on epidemiological, clinical and physiological observations. Besides, it remains a great challenge, as much remains to be understood about this new disease-causing virus. Therefore, we seek to provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2, including its classification, origin, genomic structure, replication cycle, transmission, pathogenesis, clinical aspects, diagnosis, treatments, prevention and vaccine options. We conducted a literature search for the articles published up to August 2020 using the keywords 'SAR-CoV-2' and 'COVID19' in medical databases; PubMed, google scholar, EMBASE, and web of science. Based on the information collected, the emerging COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, exhibits strong infectivity but less virulence in terms of severity of disease and mortality rates in certain age groups. It inflicts more damage in terms of peoples' health and well-being, social life, and global economic impacts. Unfortunately, there is no adequate global and standard response to this pandemic to date, and each country is facing a crisis based on its situation, expertise, and hypotheses. While there is no effective therapy and vaccine against the novel SARS-CoV-2 yet, preventive measures are the only tool available to our disposal to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Early in the previous century there was an outbreak of the Spanish Flue and towards the end of the 60's, the AIDS epidemic (HIV). Since the start of the current century, several epidemics broke out and spread to various places around the world, for instance, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), the Avian Influenza and the Swine Influenza. In 2014 there was an outbreak of Ebola (Ebola virus disease) and in 2015 the Zika virus emerged and there were more. Epidemics cause havoc and impact all areas of life. Each epidemic takes an unfathomable price in lives. It is estimated, for example, that the AIDS epidemic took the lives of some 30 million people. The Corona virus (Covid-19) broke out in China, towards the end of 2019 and spread to most parts of the world. The implications of the outbreak are similar in many countries, among others, due to the uncertainty regarding the way the virus spreads, the appropriate treatment, the lack of vaccination and the high rate of deaths. Naturally, at such times physical protection is a top priority. However, coping with the implications to people's mental health is no less important and these may result in long-term negative impacts.",2020-05-01,"Shelef, Leah; Zalsman, Gil",Harefuah,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32431119/,218758876.0

We test our approach in Colombia, which has implemented an unparalleled number of mitigation measures and has reopened its economy earlier than regional neighbors. We find that COVID-19 increases the poverty headcount to a daunting degree (between 3.0 and 9.1 pp increases). Mitigation measures vary considerably in their individual impact (up to 0.9 pp poverty reduction). A fiscally neutral Universal Basic Income program would cause larger poverty reductions.

Covid19 emergency levels were stratified according to the World Health Organization: phase I (January 25–February 25, 2020), phase II (February 26–March 19), phase III (March 20–April 20). RESULTS: There were fewer outpatient FNAs and surgeries in 2020 than in 2019. There were no thyroid surgeries during phase I. There were also fewer surgeries for cancer with a significant reduction of advanced stage cancer treatments, mainly stage T1b N1a in phase II and T3bN1b in phase III. Operative times and postoperative stays were significantly shorter during the pandemic compared to our institutional baseline.

There is growing evidence describing pathophysiological resemblance of SARS-CoV-2 infection with other coronavirus infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 receptors play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of the virus. Disruption of this receptor leads to cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysfunction, and heart failure. Patients with cardiovascular disease are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and they are more likely to develop severe symptoms. Hypertension, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy and coronary heart disease are amongst major cardiovascular disease comorbidities seen in severe cases of COVID-19. There is growing literature exploring cardiac involvement in SARS-CoV-2. Myocardial injury is one of the important pathogenic features of COVID-19. As a surrogate for myocardial injury, multiple studies have shown increased cardiac biomarkers mainly cardiac troponins I and T in the infected patients especially those with severe disease. Myocarditis is depicted as another cause of morbidity amongst COVID-19 patients. The exact mechanisms of how SARS-CoV-2 can cause myocardial injury are not clearly understood.

METHODS: The PRIORITY (Pregnancy CoRonavIrus Outcomes RegIsTrY) study is an ongoing nationwide prospective cohort study of people in the United States who are pregnant or up to 6 weeks postpregnancy with known or suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We analyzed the clinical presentation and disease course of COVID-19 in participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and reported symptoms at the time of testing. RESULTS: Of 991 participants enrolled from March 22, 2020, until July 10, 2020, 736 had symptoms of COVID-19 at the time of testing; 594 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and 142 tested negative in this symptomatic group. Mean age was 31.3 years (SD 5.1), and 37% will nulliparous. Ninety-five percent were outpatients. Participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-infection were a geographically diverse cohort: 34% from the Northeast, 25% from the West, 21% from the South, and 18% from the Midwest. Thirty-one percent of study participants were Latina, and 9% were Black. The average gestational age at enrollment was 24.1 weeks, and 13% of participants were enrolled after pregnancy. The most prevalent first symptoms in the cohort of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were cough (20%), sore throat (16%), body aches (12%), and fever (12%). Median time to symptom resolution was 37 days (95% CI 35-39). One quarter (25%) of participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection had persistent symptoms 8 or more weeks after symptom onset.

This review summarizes current knowledge about ACE2 as a multifunctional protein, focusing on its relevance in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). As an enzyme, ACE2 may be protective in IBD because it favors the counter-regulatory arm of the renin-angiotensin system or deleterious because it metabolizes other anti-inflammatory/repairing elements. Meanwhile, as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the impact of ACE2 expression/activity on infection is still under debate because no direct evidence has been reported and, again, both protective and deleterious pathways are possible. Research has shown that ACE2 regulates the expression of the neutral amino acid transporter B(0)AT1, controlling tryptophan-associated intestinal inflammation and nutritional status. Finally, intact membrane-bound or shed soluble ACE2 can also trigger integrin signaling, modulating the response to anti-integrin biologic drugs used to treat IBD (such as vedolizumab) and fibrosis, a long-term complication of IBD.

wng7m9xo,,WHO,Serpentoviruses: More than Respiratory Pathogens,,,,unk,"In recent years, nidoviruses have emerged as important respiratory pathogens of reptiles, affecting captive python populations. In pythons, nidovirus (recently reclassified as serpentovirus) infection induces an inflammation of the upper respiratory and alimentary tract which can develop into a severe, often fatal proliferative pneumonia. We observed pyogranulomatous and fibrinonecrotic lesions in organ systems other than the respiratory tract during full postmortem examinations on 30 serpentovirus reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)-positive pythons of varying species originating from Switzerland and Spain. The observations prompted us to study whether this not yet reported wider distribution of lesions is associated with previously unknown serpentoviruses or changes in the serpentovirus genome. RT-PCR and inoculation of Morelia viridis cell cultures served to recruit the cases and obtain virus isolates. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining against serpentovirus nucleoprotein demonstrated that the virus infects not only a broad spectrum of epithelia (respiratory and alimentary epithelium, hepatocytes, renal tubules, pancreatic ducts, etc.), but also intravascular monocytes, intralesional macrophages, and endothelial cells. With next-generation sequencing we obtained a full-length genome for a novel serpentovirus species circulating in Switzerland. Analysis of viral genomes recovered from pythons showing serpentovirus infection-associated respiratory or systemic disease did not reveal sequence association to phenotypes; however, functional studies with different strains are needed to confirm this observation. The results indicate that serpentoviruses have a broad cell and tissue tropism, further suggesting that the course of infection could vary and involve lesions in a broad spectrum of tissues and organ systems as a consequence of monocyte-mediated viral systemic spread.IMPORTANCE During the last years, python nidoviruses (now reclassified as serpentoviruses) have become a primary cause of fatal disease in pythons. Serpentoviruses represent a threat to captive snake collections, as they spread rapidly and can be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Our study indicates that, different from previous evidence, the viruses do not only affect the respiratory tract, but can spread in the entire body with blood monocytes, have a broad spectrum of target cells, and can induce a variety of lesions. Nidovirales is an order of animal and human viruses that comprises important zoonotic pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2. Serpentoviruses belong to the same order as the above-mentioned human viruses and show similar characteristics (rapid spread, respiratory and gastrointestinal tropism, etc.). The present study confirms the relevance of natural animal diseases to better understand the complexity of viruses of the order Nidovirales.",2020,"Dervas, Eva; Hepojoki, Jussi; Smura, Teemu; Prähauser, Barbara; Windbichler, Katharina; Blümich, Sandra; Ramis, Antonio; Hetzel, Udo; Kipar, Anja",J. virol,,#640272,,,,,220440010.0

Methods The only highest-quality, large-number Lexis data available were pooled from nine European countries: Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland; raw-data modes (and means/medians ≥60y, plus thin-plate-splines), were analyzed, plus loess-smoothed equivalents for individual countries. Results Here we show that for ~25-30 years (cohorts 1880- ~1909) dramatic overall sex differences existed between pooled raw-death-age changes: male modal ages being near-constant (77.2y + standard deviation 1.58y); females’ increased.

OBJECTIVES To assess the efficacy and safety of a LAMA added to any dose of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) compared with the same dose of ICS alone for adults whose asthma is not well controlled. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register (CAGR) from inception to April 2015, and we imposed no restriction on language of publication. We also searched clinicaltrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal and drug company registries to identify unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA We searched for parallel and cross-over randomised controlled trials in which adults whose asthma was not well controlled by ICS alone were randomly assigned to receive LAMA add-on or placebo (both combined with ICS) for at least 12 weeks. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently screened the searches and extracted data from study reports. We used Covidence for duplicate screening, extraction of study characteristics and numerical data and risk of bias ratings. Pre-specified primary outcomes included exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids, quality of life and all-cause serious adverse events. MAIN RESULTS We identified five studies that met the inclusion criteria. All studies applied a double-blind, double-dummy design, and the population of all studies totalled 2563 adult participants. Study duration ranged from 12 weeks to 52 weeks, and risk of bias across domains in all studies was low. Trials included more women than men (33% to 47% male), and mean age of participants ranged from 41 to 48 years. Participants generally had a long history of asthma, and mean baseline predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was between 72% and 75% in three studies reporting pre-bronchodilator values.The rate of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS) was lower in patients prescribed an LAMA add-on than in those receiving the same dose of ICS alone (odds ratio (OR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46 to 0.93; 2277 participants; four studies; I(2) = 0%; high-quality evidence), meaning that 27 fewer people per 1000 would have an exacerbation over 21 weeks requiring OCS with LAMA compared with ICS alone (95% CI 42 fewer to 6 fewer).All-cause serious adverse events (SAEs) and exacerbations requiring hospital admission were rare and the effects too imprecise to permit firm conclusions, but effects suggested that LAMA add-on may be associated with fewer of both compared with ICS alone (SAEs: OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.57; 2532 participants; four studies; low-quality evidence; exacerbations requiring hospital admission: OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.47; 2562 participants; five studies; moderate-quality evidence). Additional therapy with a LAMA showed no clear benefit in terms of quality of life compared with ICS given alone; high-quality evidence showed only a small mean improvement in quality of life as measured on the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), which was not statistically significant. The same was true for asthma control as measured on the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), which was based on moderate-quality evidence. LAMA combined with ICS showed consistent benefit in a range of lung function measures compared with the same dose of ICS alone, and LAMA was not associated with significantly higher rates of adverse events than were reported with placebo. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS For adults taking ICS for asthma without a long-acting beta₂-agonist (LABA), LAMA given as add-on treatment reduces the likelihood of exacerbations requiring treatment with OCS and improves lung function. The benefits of LAMA combined with ICS for hospital admissions, all-cause serious adverse events, quality of life and asthma control remain unknown.Results of this review, along with findings of related reviews conducted to assess the use of LAMA in other clinical scenarios involving asthma, can help to define the role of LAMA in the management of asthma. Trials of longer duration (up to 52 weeks) would provide a better opportunity to observe rare events such as serious adverse events and exacerbations requiring hospital admission.",2015,"Anderson, Debbie E; Kew, Kayleigh M; Boyter, Anne C",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd011397.pub2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26301488/,205208691.0

We sought to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients being treated inside and outside Hubei province, and explore the factors underlying these differences. METHODS: Collaborating with the National Health Commission, we established a retrospective cohort to study hospitalised COVID-19 cases in China. Clinical characteristics, the rate of severe events and deaths, and the time to critical illness (invasive ventilation or intensive care unit admission or death) were compared between patients within and outside Hubei. The impact of Wuhan-related exposure (a presumed key factor that drove the severe situation in Hubei, as Wuhan is the epicentre as well the administrative centre of Hubei province) and the duration between symptom onset and admission on prognosis were also determined. RESULTS: At the data cut-off (31 January 2020), 1590 cases from 575 hospitals in 31 provincial administrative regions were collected (core cohort). The overall rate of severe cases and mortality was 16.0% and 3.2%, respectively. Patients in Hubei (predominantly with Wuhan-related exposure, 597 (92.3%) out of 647) were older (mean age 49.7 versus 44.9â years), had more cases with comorbidity (32.9% versus 19.7%), higher symptomatic burden, abnormal radiologic manifestations and, especially, a longer waiting time between symptom onset and admission (5.7 versus 4.5â days) compared with patients outside Hubei. Patients in Hubei (severe event rate 23.0% versus 11.1%, death rate 7.3% versus 0.3%, HR (95% CI) for critical illness 1.59 (1.05-2.41)) have a poorer prognosis compared with patients outside Hubei after adjusting for age and comorbidity. However, among patients outside Hubei, the duration from symptom onset to hospitalisation (mean 4.4 versus 4.7â days) and prognosis (HR (95%) 0.84 (0.40-1.80)) were similar between patients with or without Wuhan-related exposure. In the overall population, the waiting time, but neither treated in Hubei nor Wuhan-related exposure, remained an independent prognostic factor (HR (95%) 1.05 (1.01-1.08)). CONCLUSION: There were more severe cases and poorer outcomes for COVID-19 patients treated in Hubei, which might be attributed to the prolonged duration of symptom onset to hospitalisation in the epicentre.

The primary aim is to compare differences in anxiety and depression scores of pregnant women between countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary aim is to assess demographic, economic, and social aspects affecting maternal anxiety and depression scores among pregnant women worldwide in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we will be able to compare differences in perception of the different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic (social distancing, restrictions related to delivery) between countries and according to the epidemic status (number of infected patients, number of reported deaths). The comparisons will also be done according to the COVID-19 status of the participants. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: It is a web-based anonymous survey of pregnant women living in countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey is comprised of 3 sections:Web-based recruitment for health research has proven to be cost-effective and efficient. At current times with the COVID-19 pandemic, limited resources and social distancing restrictions, performing a mental health study involving pregnant women on a large international scale cannot be safely conducted without involving social-media.The fears of pregnant women fall into 3 categories: the medical condition, the economic status and the organization of daily activity.The study has received approval of the medical ethics committee and has been registered on Clinicaltrials.gov.

These mathematical models play a significant role in the understanding of COVID-19 transmission mechanisms, structures, and features. Considering that the disease has spread sporadically around the world, causing large scale socioeconomic disruption unwitnessed in contemporary ages since World War II, researchers, stakeholders, government, and the society at large are actively engaged in finding ways to reduce the rate of infection until a cure or vaccination procedure is established. We advanced argument for the various forms of the mathematical model of epidemics and highlighted their relevance in the containment of COVID-19 at the present time.

cwkj1tbf,,WHO,Medicaid prescription limits and their implications for naloxone accessibility,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Expanding access to and utilization of naloxone is a vitally important harm reduction strategy for preventing opioid overdose deaths, particularly in vulnerable populations like Medicaid beneficiaries. The objective of this study was to characterize the landscape of monthly prescription fill limit policies in Medicaid programs and their potential implications for expanding naloxone use for opioid overdose harm reduction. METHODS: A cross-sectional, multi-modal online and telephonic data collection strategy was used to identify and describe the presence and characteristics of monthly prescription fill limit policies across state Medicaid programs. Contextual characteristics were described regarding each state's Medicaid enrollment, opioid prescribing rates, and overdose death rates. Data collection and analysis occurred between February and May 2020. RESULTS: Medicaid-covered naloxone fills are currently subject to monthly prescription fill limit policies in 10 state Medicaid programs, which cover 20 % of the Medicaid population nationwide. Seven of these programs are located in states ranking in the top 10 highest per-capita opioid prescribing rates in the country. However, 8 of these programs are located in states with opioid overdose death rates below the national average. CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid beneficiaries at high risk of opioid overdose living in states with monthly prescription fill limits may experience significant barriers to obtaining naloxone. Exempting naloxone from Medicaid prescription limit restrictions may help spur broader adoption of naloxone for opioid overdose mortality prevention, especially in states with high opioid prescribing rates. Achieving unfettered naloxone coverage in Medicaid is critical as opioid overdoses and Medicaid enrollment increase amid the COVID-19 pandemic.",2021,"Roberts, Andrew W; Look, Kevin A; Trull, Grace; Carpenter, Delesha M",Drug Alcohol Depend,,#866644,,,,,223518758.0

The items of the CSS were constructed based on a review of existing scales, expert evaluations, and participant interviews. The factor structure of COVID-19 Stress Scale (CSS) was examined through the use of an exploratory factor analysis.

Results suggest a five-factor structure: Vexation with Others, Immediate Concerns, Routine Disruption, Uncertainty about the Future, and Systemic stressors (abbreviated as VIRUS) explaining 55.269% of the total variance in COVID-19 stress. Coefficient alphas for the entire scale (0.90) and for each of the five factors, ranging from 0.69–0.85, indicate satisfactory internal consistency. One-way analysis of variance was done to assess the differences among emotion-focused, problem-solving, and seeking social support coping strategy. Correlations were calculated between various coping strategies and COVID-19 Stress. Results suggested that seeking social support was the most used coping strategy.

Human Flesh Searching (HFS) is a form of collective online behavior where netizens contribute information to social media and/or networking platforms about a certain event or a target individual or group to achieve what they regard as justice. It has been used to identify and investigate crime. Some netizens go further and take justice into their own hands by punishing alleged criminals and deviants through online shaming. Using the results of a survey conducted in Hong Kong, the research found both gender and time spent online are not significant variables to predict netizens’ intention to contribute to HFS. A positive attitude toward HFS was the strongest predictor of HFS intention. Vigilantism was also a strong predictor of HFS intention. Vigilantism not only affects HFS intention directly, but also indirectly through a positive attitude on HFS. Fairness might negatively influence people’s HFS intention and attitude toward HFS; however, this influence was found to be weak in the present study. Social Justice might not affect HFS intention directly, yet it might exert its effect via a positive attitude toward HFS.

Existing scoring systems have been ineffective for identifying patient decompensation. Machine learning (ML) may offer an alternative strategy. A prospectively validated method to predict the need for ventilation in COVID-19 patients is essential to help triage patients, allocate resources, and prevent emergency intubations and their associated risks. METHODS: In a multicenter clinical trial, we evaluated the performance of a machine learning algorithm for prediction of invasive mechanical ventilation of COVID-19 patients within 24 h of an initial encounter. We enrolled patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis who were admitted to five United States health systems between March 24 and May 4, 2020. RESULTS: 197 patients were enrolled in the REspirAtory Decompensation and model for the triage of covid-19 patients: a prospective studY (READY) clinical trial. The algorithm had a higher diagnostic odds ratio (DOR, 12.58) for predicting ventilation than a comparator early warning system, the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS). The algorithm also achieved significantly higher sensitivity (0.90) than MEWS, which achieved a sensitivity of 0.78, while maintaining a higher specificity (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In the first clinical trial of a machine learning algorithm for ventilation needs among COVID-19 patients, the algorithm demonstrated accurate prediction of the need for mechanical ventilation within 24 h. This algorithm may help care teams effectively triage patients and allocate resources.

They can be colonized with the Staphylococcus aureus complex, which includes Staphylococcus schweitzeri and Staphylococcus argenteus. Fecal carriage of S. aureus complex in the straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) has been described. However, data on their transmission and adaptation in animals and humans are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the population structure of the S. aureus complex in E. helvum and to assess the geographical spread of S. aureus complex among other animals and humans. Fecal samples were collected from E. helvum in Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. The isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, spa typing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Isolates were screened for the presence of lukS/lukF-PV and the immune evasion cluster (scn, sak, chp) which is frequently found in isolates adapted to the human host. A Neighbor-Joining tree was constructed using the concatenated sequences of the seven MLST genes. A total of 250 fecal samples were collected and 53 isolates were included in the final analysis. They were identified as S. aureus (n = 28), S. schweitzeri (n = 11) and S. argenteus (n = 14). Only one S. aureus was resistant to penicillin and another isolate was intermediately susceptible to tetracycline. The scn, sak, and chp gene were not detected. Species-specific MLST clonal complexes (CC) were detected for S. aureus (CC1725), S. argenteus (CC3960, CC3961), and S. schweitzeri (CC2463). STs of S. schweitzeri from this study were similar to STs from bats in Nigeria (ST2464) and Gabon (ST1700) or from monkey in Côte d'Ivoire (ST2058, ST2072). This suggests host adaptation of certain clones to wildlife mammals with a wide geographical spread in Africa. In conclusion, there is evidence of fecal carriage of members of S. aureus complex in E. helvum. S. schweitzeri from bats in Nigeria are closely related to those from bats and monkeys in West and Central Africa suggesting a cross-species transmission and wide geographical distribution. The low antimicrobial resistance rates and the absence of the immune evasion cluster suggests a limited exposure of these isolates to humans.",2018-02-13,"Olatimehin, Ayodele; Shittu, Adebayo O.; Onwugamba, Francis C.; Mellmann, Alexander; Becker, Karsten; Schaumburg, Frieder",Front Microbiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/af475b1445628312443de29d85bff40825d411e0.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5816944.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29487577/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00162,3587643.0

Indeed, in recent years controversy has intensified over strains resistant to carbapenem and/or colistin. Various therapeutic solutions are used to overcome administration of last line antibiotics. In this context, drug repurposing, which consists of using a non-antibiotic compound to treat multi-drug resistant bacteria (MDR), is encouraged. In this review, we first report what may have led to drug repurposing. Main definitions, advantages and drawbacks are summarized. Three major methods are described: phenotypic, computational and serendipity. In a second time we will focus on the current knowledge in drug repurposing for carbapenem and colistin-resistant bacteria with different studies describing repurposed compounds tested on Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, we show that drug combination therapies can increase successful by drug repurposing strategy.

The susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 is of concern due to the potential for interspecies transmission, and the requirement for pre-clinical animal models to develop effective countermeasures. In the current study, we determined the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to (i) replicate in porcine cell lines, (ii) establish infection in domestic pigs via experimental oral/intranasal/intratracheal inoculation, and (iii) transmit to co-housed naïve sentinel pigs. SARS-CoV-2 was able to replicate in two different porcine cell lines with cytopathic effects. Interestingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2-inoculated pigs showed evidence of clinical signs, viral replication or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. Moreover, none of the sentinel pigs displayed markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that although different porcine cell lines are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, five-week old pigs are not susceptible to infection via oral/intranasal/intratracheal challenge.

METHODS Two metal catalysts Ag/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 were pressed into wafers. One hundred microL 10(6) TCID50/mL SARS-CoV, 100 microL 10(6) PFU/mL recombinant baculovirus expressing hamster's prion protein (haPrP) protein and roughly 10(6) E. coli were slowly dropped onto the surfaces of the catalyst wafers and exposed for 5 and 20 min, respectively. After eluted from the surfaces of wafers, the infectivity of viruses and propagation of bacteria were measured. The expression of PrP protein was determined by Western blot. The morphological changes of bacteria were observed by electronic microscopy. RESULTS After exposure to the catalysts surfaces for 5 and 20 min, the infectivity of SARS-CoV in Vero cells and baculovirus in Sf9 cells dropped down to a very low and undetectable level, and no colony was detected using bacteria culture method. The expression of haPrP protein reduced to 21.8% in the preparation of Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus exposed for 5 min and was undetectable exposed for 20 min. Bacterial membranes seemed to be cracked and the cytoplasm seemed to be effluent from cell bodies. CONCLUSION Exposures to the surfaces of Ag/Al2O3 and Cu/Al2O3 destroy the replication and propagation abilities of SARS-CoV, baculovirus and E. coli.

To improve the immune response, an adjuvant consisting of plasmid encoding either porcine interleukin (IL)-12 or IFN-α was co-administered during vaccination. In the presence of either adjuvant, at least a three-fold increase in the primary virus-specific IFN-γ response was observed. While this enhancement was only transient (1 week) when the IL-12 expressing plasmid was used, the effect was not only still apparent at 6 weeks after vaccination in the presence of the IFN-α expressing plasmid but even after challenge with a virulent genetically divergent PRRSV. In contrast, no effect of either adjuvant on the production of anti-virus antibodies was noticed throughout the study. Despite the apparent augmentation of a T helper (Th) 1 type response by the inclusion of IFN-α or IL-12 during vaccination, this modulation did not necessarily correlate with a reduction in viremia. Since a similar increase in the degree of the IFN-γ response to the PRRSV vaccine could be achieved by substituting polyinosinic–polycytidylic acid in lieu of either cytokine, exposure to PRRSV in the presence of a variety of Th 1 polarizing molecules can positively influence the development of the cell-mediated immune response of swine to this pathogen.

We sequenced and analyzed two new PRVC strains, RV0104 (G3), and RV0143 (G6) and compared their pathogenesis with that of the historic strain Cowden (G1) in gnotobiotic (Gn) pigs. Near complete genome sequence analysis confirmed that these two strains were distinct from one another and the Cowden strain. VP1, VP2, VP6, NSP1-NSP3, and NSP5 genes were more similar between Cowden and RV0143, whereas VP3, VP7, and NSP4 shared higher nucleotide identity between Cowden and RV0104.

All 3-day-old piglets developed severe diarrhea, anorexia, and lethargy, with mean PRVC fecal shedding titers peaking and numerically higher in RV0104 and RV0143 piglets on post infection day (PID) 2. Histopathological examination of the small intestine revealed that the 3-day-old Cowden and RV0104 inoculated piglets were mildly affected, while significant destruction of small intestinal villi was observed in the RV0143 inoculated piglets. Consistent with the highest degree of pathological changes in the small intestines, the RV0143 inoculated piglets had numerically higher levels of serum IL-17 and IFN-α cytokines and numerically lower PRVC IgA geometric mean antibody titers. Milder pathological changes and overall higher titers of PRVC IgA antibodies were observed in 3-week-old vs. 3-day-old piglets. Additionally, diarrhea was only observed in RV0104 and RV0143 (but not Cowden) inoculated 3-week-old piglets, while levels of serum IL-10 and PRVC IgA antibodies were higher in Cowden inoculated pigs, consistent with the lack of diarrhea.

Better understanding of these approaches, particularly efforts to create a single point of entry to comprehensive, evidence-based services through youth service hubs, is needed to help guide future implementation and evaluation. This scoping review identifies the key principles and characteristics of these models of care, as well as the state of the literature, particularly with regard to implementation and replicability. Method Electronic databases and grey literature sources were searched for material from 2001 to 2019, with diverse search terms capturing the concept of ""integrated"" or ""one-stop shop"" youth mental health services. Title/abstract and full text review were conducted, as well as additional focused searching. After screening 4891 texts at the title/abstract level and 496 at the full-text level, 110 documents were included for data extraction. Results Several integrated care hub models for youth mental health services and related frameworks were identified internationally, largely in high-income countries. Common principles included an emphasis on rapid access to care and early intervention, youth and family engagement, youth-friendly settings and services, evidence-informed approaches, and partnerships and collaboration. Program characteristics also revealed similarities (e.g., providing evidence-informed or evidence-based services in youth-friendly spaces), with some differences (e.g., care coordination methods, types of service providers), potentially attributable to lack of available information about key ingredients. Outcome research was limited, with few rigorous evaluations of youth outcomes. Moreover, sufficient information for replication, community evaluation of feasibility or actual implementation was rarely provided. Conclusion Internationally, integrated youth service hubs were found to share common key principles, while providing comprehensive services to youth with mental health difficulties. There is a great need for common language and measurement framework to facilitate replication, rigorous evaluation of outcomes, knowledge exchange, and dissemination of findings.",2019,"Settipani, Cara A; Hawke, Lisa D; Cleverley, Kristin; Chaim, Gloria; Cheung, Amy; Mehra, Kamna; Rice, Maureen; Szatmari, Peter; Henderson, Joanna",International journal of mental health systems,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13033-019-0306-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31367230/,198198107.0

This report summarizes the expected impact of COVID-19 on behavioral health, as well as strategies to address mental health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. The state of Michigan in the USA is used to illustrate the complexity of the mental health issues and the critical gaps in the behavioral health infrastructure as they pertain to COVID-19. Scoping review was conducted to identify potential mental health needs and issues during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath. RECENT FINDINGS: The ramifications of COVID-19 on mental health are extensive, with the potential to negatively impact diverse populations including healthcare providers, children and adolescents, older adults, the LGBTQ community, and individuals with pre-existing mental illness. Suicide rates, alone, are expected to rise for Michiganders due to the economic downturn, isolation and quarantine, increased substance use, insomnia, and increased access to guns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This report promotes awareness of a behavioral health crisis due to COVID-19. Increasing access to behavioral health care should minimize COVID-19's negative influence on mental health in Michigan. We propose a three-prong approach to access: awareness, affordability, and technology. Addressing workforce development and fixing gaps in critical behavioral health infrastructure will also be essential. These actions need to be implemented immediately to prepare for the expected ""surge"" of behavioral health needs in the ensuing months.",2020,"Edwards, Evonne; Janney, Carol A; Mancuso, Amy; Rollings, Heide; VanDenToorn, Amy; DeYoung, Mariah; Halstead, Scott; Eastburg, Mark",Curr Psychiatry Rep,,#962966,,,,,227502684.0

COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is estimated to have an cumulative global case-fatality rate as high as 7.2%[1]. As the SARS-CoV-2 spread across the globe it catalyzed new urgency in building systems to allow rapid sharing and dissemination of data between international healthcare infrastructures and governments in a worldwide effort focused on case tracking/tracing, identifying effective therapeutic protocols, securing healthcare resources, and in drug and vaccine research. In addition to the worldwide efforts to share clinical and routine population health data, there are many large-scale efforts to collect and disseminate medical imaging data, owing to the critical role that imaging has played in diagnosis and management around the world. Given reported false negative rates of the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of up to 61%[2, 3], imaging can be used as an important adjunct or alternative. Furthermore, there has been a shortage of test-kits worldwide and laboratories in many testing sites have struggled to process the available tests within a reasonable time frame.

The changing geopolitical landscape has led to its resurgence in recent years. The public rejection of traditional forms of torture that rely on the infliction of physical pain has paradoxically increased the reliance on psychological methods of torture. This critical commentary aims to define and characterize psychological torture (PT) while exploring practical, legal, ethical and therapeutic implications relevant to clinicians and policymakers. Psychological torture comes in a range of forms. It is being increasingly justified and adopted by legitimate authorities in the name of national security. The emphasis on the avoidance of physical pain leads to the assumption that PT does not produce the levels of suffering and harm that are associated with physically violent forms of torture. This same assumption has allowed for the implication of mental health professionals in theorizing and providing legitimacy for the actions of perpetrators. Psychological torture is still poorly defined with limited understanding of its long-term psychiatric impact on those who are subjected to it.

Herein, we describe a new mock circuit that enables experimental ECCO(2)R research without animal models. In a second step, we use this model to investigate three experimental scenarios of ECCO(2)R: (I) the influence of hemoglobin concentration on CO(2) removal. (II) a potentially portable ECCO(2)R that uses air instead of oxygen, (III) a low-flow ECCO(2)R that achieves effective CO(2) clearance by recirculation and acidification of the limited blood volume of a small dual lumen cannula (such as a dialysis catheter). RESULTS: With the presented ECCO(2)R mock, CO(2) removal rates comparable to previous studies were obtained. The mock works with either fresh porcine blood or diluted expired human packed red blood cells. However, fresh porcine blood was preferred because of better handling and availability. In the second step of this work, hemoglobin concentration was identified as an important factor for CO(2) removal. In the second scenario, an air-driven ECCO(2)R setup showed only a slightly lower CO(2) wash-out than the same setup with pure oxygen as sweep gas. In the last scenario, the low-flow ECCO(2)R, the blood flow at the test membrane lung was successfully raised with a recirculation channel without the need to increase cannula flow. Low recirculation ratios resulted in increased efficiency, while high recirculation ratios caused slightly reduced CO(2) removal rates. Acidification of the CO(2) depleted blood in the recirculation channel caused an increase in CO(2) removal rate. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a simple and cost effective, yet powerful, “in-vitro” ECCO(2)R model that can be used as an alternative to animal experiments for many research scenarios.

Initial interaction between DCs and viruses facilitates cell activation and migration to secondary lymphoid tissues, where these antigen presenting cells (APCs) prime specific adaptive immune responses. Some viruses, however, have evolved strategies to subvert the migratory capacity of DCs as a way to disseminate infection systemically. Here we focus on the role of Siglec-1, a sialic acid-binding type I lectin receptor potently upregulated by type I interferons on DCs, that acts as a double edge sword, containing viral replication through the induction of antiviral immunity, but also favoring viral spread within tissues. Such is the case for distant enveloped viruses like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 or Ebola virus (EBOV), which incorporate sialic acid-containing gangliosides on their viral membrane and are effectively recognized by Siglec-1. Here we review how Siglec-1 is highly induced on the surface of human DCs upon viral infection, the way this impacts different antigen presentation pathways, and how enveloped viruses have evolved to exploit these APC functions as a potent dissemination strategy in different anatomical compartments.",2019-12-19,"Perez-Zsolt, Daniel; Martinez-Picado, Javier; Izquierdo-Useros, Nuria",Viruses,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/bc763a4c1cb0175d61d1332af8d137d0482df73b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7019426.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7019426/,

As fast as the virus spread, it became evident that COVID‐19 is a multi‐system disease, that may involve multiple organs, and has a high risk of thrombosis, associated with striking elevations in pro‐inflammatory cytokines, D‐dimer and fibrinogen, but without disseminated intravascular coagulation. Postmortem studies have confirmed the high incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), but also notably revealed diffuse microvascular thrombi with endothelial swelling, consistent with a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), and inter‐alveolar endothelial deposits of complement activation fragments. The clinicopathologic presentation of COVID‐19 thus parallels that of other thrombotic diseases, such as atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), that are caused by dysregulation of the complement system. This raises the specter that many of the thrombotic complications arising from SARS‐CoV‐2 infections may be triggered and/or exacerbated by excess complement activation. This is of major potential clinical relevance, as currently available anti‐complement therapies that are highly effective in protecting against thrombosis in aHUS, could be efficacious in COVID‐19. In this review, we provide mounting evidence for complement participating in the pathophysiology underlying the thrombotic diathesis associated with pathogenic coronaviruses, including SARS‐CoV‐2.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the level of awareness, perception, and attitude regarding the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and infection control among Jordanian dentists. METHODS: The study population consisted of dentists who worked in private clinics, hospitals, and health centers in Jordan. An online questionnaire was sent to a sample of Jordanian dentists in March 2020. The questionnaire was comprised of a series of questions about dentists’ demographic characteristics; their awareness of the incubation period, the symptoms of the disease, mode of transmission of COVID-19 and infection control measures for preventing COVID-19; and their attitude toward treating patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: This study included a total of 368 dentists aged 22-73 years (mean 32.9 years, SD 10.6 years). A total of 112 (30.4%) dentists had completed a master or residency program in dentistry, 195 (53.0%) had received training in infection control in dentistry, and 28 (7.6%) had attended training or lectures regarding COVID-19. A total of 133 (36.1%) dentists reported that the incubation period is 1-14 days. The majority of dentists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms and ways of identifying patients at risk of having COVID-19, were able to correctly report known modes of transmission, and were aware of measures for preventing COVID-19 transmission in dental clinics. A total of 275 (74.7%) believed that it was necessary to ask patients to sit far from each other, wear masks while in the waiting room, and wash hands before getting in the dental chair to decrease disease transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Jordanian dentists were aware of COVID-19 symptoms, mode of transmission, and infection controls and measures in dental clinics. However, dentists had limited comprehension of the extra precautionary measures that protect the dental staff and other patients from COVID-19.

Without government intervention, our simulation shows that the epidemic peaks on 22 March, 2020 and ends on 29 August, 2022. By the end of the epidemic, more than 21 million people will be infected, and the death toll is close to 3.8 million. We further conduct counterfactual experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of different polices against the virus. We find that no single policy can effectively suppress the epidemic, and the most effective policy is a hybrid policy with lockdown and broadening testing. Lockdown policy alone is ineffective in controlling the epidemic as agents would have optimally stayed at home anyway if the infection risk is high even without a lockdown. Broadening testing solely will accelerate the return to normal life as there are fewer infected people hanging around. However, as people do not internalize the social costs of returning to normal life, the epidemic could get even worse. Increasing medical capacity without any other measures only has temporary effects on reducing the death toll. We also find that random testing is too inefficient unless a majority of population is infected.",2020-06-10,"Ng, Wung Lik",J Macroecon,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/52f34b660efa5864af5bd428ce3091083bde0b82.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7286282.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0164070420301567; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32542061/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164070420301567?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmacro.2020.103230,219560745.0

The unavailability of a specific antiviral drug against the chikungunya virus (CHIKV) disease has created an alarming situation to identify or develop potent chemical molecules for remedial management of CHIKV. In the present investigation, in silico studies of dihydrorugosaflavonoid derivatives (5a–f) with non-structural protein-3 (nsP3) were carried out. nsP3 replication protein has recently been considered as a possible antiviral target in which crucial inhibitors fit into the adenosine-binding pocket of the macrodomain. The 4′-halogenated dihydrorugosaflavonoids displayed intrinsic binding with the nsp3 macrodomain (PDB ID: 3GPO) of CHIKV. Compounds 5c and 5d showed docking scores of −7.54 and −6.86 kcal mol(–1), respectively. Various in vitro assays were performed to confirm their (5a–f) antiviral potential against CHIKV. The non-cytotoxic dose was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and was found to be <100 μM. The compounds 5c and 5d showed their inhibitory potential for CHIKV, which was determined through cytopathic effect assay and plaque reduction assay, which show inhibition up to 95 and 92% for 70 μM concentration of the compounds, respectively. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay result confirmed the ability of 5c and 5d to reduce the viral RNA level at 70 μM concentration of compounds to nearly 95 and 93% concentration, respectively, in cells with CHIKV infection. Further, the CHIKV-inhibitory capacity of these compounds was corroborated by execution of immunofluorescence assay. The executed work will be meaningful for the future research of studied dihydrorugosaflavonoids against prime antiviral entrants, leading to remedial management to preclude CHIKV infection.",2019-11-18,"Puranik, Ninad V.; Rani, Ruchi; Singh, Vedita Anand; Tomar, Shailly; Puntambekar, Hemalata M.; Srivastava, Pratibha",ACS Omega,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e1dc3ea3a7ad4303e6e57417de0daee78e31d5bb.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6893968.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6893968/,

These techniques are considered curative for small hepatic tumors, with post-ablation outcomes most commonly assessed by an imaging follow up. However, there is increasing evidence of a discrepancy between radiological and pathological findings when ablated lesions are evaluated following liver resection or liver transplantation. A comprehensive review of the available literature reporting the complete pathological response (cPR) following RFA and MWA was performed to estimate the success rate and identify the factors associated with treatment failure. Following RFA, cPR is reported in 26-96% of tumors compared to 57-95% with MWA. Larger tumor size and vessels larger than 3 mm adjacent to the treated tumor are the most important factors identified by previous studies associated with viable residual tumors after RFA. Correlating post-ablation radiological studies with pathological findings shows that computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have low sensitivity but high specificity for detecting residual viable or recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors. There are promising recent reports combining multiprobe ablation techniques with three-dimensional treatment planning software and stereotactic-aiming instrumentation to achieve more than 90% cPR in both small and large HCC tumors. In conclusion, the reported success for achieving cPR in HCC following RFA and MWA is highly variable in different studies and decreases with increasing lesion size and unfavorable tumor characteristics. Very few studies have reported a high rate of cPR.

However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, circumstances have become anything but normal and predictable, thus putting employees' sense of occupational calling to the test. In this study, we investigate the possibility that occupational calling fluctuates across days during situations of crisis, and we identify antecedents and consequence of such fluctuations. To test our model, we conducted a daily diary study of 66 nurses working in intensive care units over 5 consecutive work days in a specialized Wuhan hospital that only admitted confirmed COVID-19 patients during the peak of the pandemic in China. We found that the daily number of code blue events (i.e., cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts with the primary goal of patient revival) was positively related to daily occupational calling for nurses. Moreover, individual differences in prosocial motivation predicted the average level and variability of occupational calling over the 5 days, which subsequently related to the nurses' job performance. Our study sheds light on how occupational calling enables people with the needed occupational knowledge and skills to function effectively in crisis situations.

RECENT FINDINGS: SAP-E sets targets for the implementation of evidence-based preventive actions and stroke services to 2030. A recent mapping of stroke care in Europe has documented massive inequalities and even in high-income European countries access to reperfusion therapy and mortality after ischaemic stroke varies significantly. Organized stroke care providing stroke unit care and access to reperfusion therapies reduces mortality and long-term disability. Stroke prevention and care are highly cost-effective. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged organized care, diverged attention from stroke and necessitated a novel approach to the implementation program because of the continued need for social distancing and reduced travelling. Consequently, meetings, training and engagement will be handled by online resources. SUMMARY: Stroke can be prevented and treated but there remain massive inequalities in Europe. SAP-E has set targets for development of stroke care. COVID-19 pandemic has led to further challenges for stroke care and implementation of the Action Plan will rely on online meetings and resources as it is yet unforeseeable when things will return to normal.

Previous studies demonstrated that concentrations of CCL11 are elevated in the sera and cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) of patients with neuroinflammatory disorders, including multiple sclerosis. Moreover, the levels of CCL11 in plasma and CSF increase with age, and CCL11 suppresses adult neurogenesis in the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in memory impairment. However, the precise source and function of CCL11 in the CNS are not fully understood. In this study, we found that activated astrocytes release CCL11, whereas microglia predominantly express the CCL11 receptor. CCL11 significantly promoted the migration of microglia, and induced microglial production of reactive oxygen species by upregulating nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase 1 (NOX1), thereby promoting excitotoxic neuronal death.

We undertook this study to evaluate and compare cost of care and reimbursement with robotic versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS AND PROCEDURES The charges and reimbursement of all robotic and laparoscopic cholecystectomies at one hospital undertaken from June 2012 to June 2013 were determined. Operative duration is defined as time into and time out of the operating room. Data are presented as median data. Comparisons were undertaken using the Mann-Whitney U-test with significance accepted at p ≤ 0.05. RESULTS Robotic cholecystectomy took longer (47 min longer) and had greater charges ($8,182.57 greater) than laparoscopic cholecystectomy (p < 0.05 for each). However, revenue, earnings before depreciation, interest, and taxes (EBDIT), and Net Income were not impacted by approach. CONCLUSIONS Relative to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, robotic cholecystectomy takes longer and has greater charges. Revenue, EBDIT, and Net Income are similar after either approach; this indicates that costs with either approach are similar. Notably, this is possible because much of hospital-based costs are determined by cost allocation and not cost accounting. Thus, the cost of longer operations and costs inherent to the robotic approach for cholecystectomy do not translate to a perceived financial burden.",2015,"Rosemurgy, Alexander; Ryan, Carrie; Klein, Richard; Sukharamwala, Prashant; Wood, Thomas; Ross, Sharona",Surgical endoscopy,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3933-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25492447/,12740867.0

During the global pandemic COVID19, urology surgeons had to reorganize their daily surgical practice. A concern with the use of minimally invasive techniques arose due to a proposed risk of viral transmission of the coronavirus disease with the creation of pneumoperitoneum. Due to this, we reviewed the literature to evaluate the use of laparoscopy and robotics during the pandemic COVID19. A literature review of viral transmission in surgery and of the available literature regarding the transmission of the COVID19 virus was performed up to April 30, 2020. We additionally reviewed surgical society guidelines and recommendations regarding surgery during this pandemic. Few studies have been performed on viral transmission during surgery. No study has been made regarding this area during minimally invasive urology cases. To date there is no study that demonstrates or can suggest the ability for a virus to be transmitted during surgical treatment whether open, laparoscopic or robotic. There is no society consensus on restricting laparoscopic or robotic surgery. However, there is expert consensus on modification of standard practices to minimize any risk of transmission. During the pandemic COVID19 we recommend the use of specific personal protective equipment for the surgeon, anesthesiologist and nursing staff in the operating room.

From January to June 2010, 63 cow-calf-pairs from 20 different farms near Zürich, Switzerland have been investigated. Each cowcalf- pair was visited three times within the first 6 weeks of life to collect data of the farm and animals, as well as blood, faecal, colostral and milk samples. An ELISA using sporozoite antigen was developed for the specific detection of anti-Cryptosporidium-IgG in blood- and colostral serum. The IgG concentration in the bloodand colostral serum was determined using radial immuno diffusion test (RID). White blood cell isolation and differential blood cell counts and California Mastitis Test were performed. Bacteriological studies on quarter-milk-samples were carried out. Cryptosporidium oocysts were diagnosed with the modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining, other protozoa with the SAFC method and Eimeria oocysts and helminth eggs were diagnosed with the combined sedimentation/floatation test. ELISAs were performed for the detection of rota- and coronavirus, E. coli F5 and Cryptosporidium spp. in bovine feces (bio-X Diagnostics®, Belgium). The highest prevalence of Cryptosporidium oocysts was 54.0% and found 7 to 20 days post natum, whereas 47.1% were suffering from diarrhea. The transfer of total IgG with the colostrum and the humoral immunity of the calf could not prevent any infection with Cryptosporidium, but the severity of the diarrhea symptoms decreased with increasing total IgG concentrations. Calves housed in open sheds showed significantly more often diarrhea, i. e. they shed more Cryptosporidium oocysts during the first 4 days and 7 to 20 days post natum, respectively. Halofuginone (Halocur®) is approved for prophylaxis against cryptosporidiosis, but it showed no effect on the excretion of Cryptosporidium oocysts in the present study.",2016,"Weber, S E; Lippuner, C; Corti, S; Deplazes, P; Hässig, M",Schweizer Archiv fur Tierheilkunde,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.17236/sat00062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27518579/,27968204.0

This paper uses data from the American Time Use Survey to explore the relationship between daily work locations and travel in the United States from 2003 to 2017. Outcome variables include travel duration and travel during peak periods. Home is by far the most common non-office work location, but working from other people’s homes, cafés/libraries, vehicles, and combinations of multiple locations are also measured. Findings show that working from home only on a day (full-day telework) decreases daily travel duration and increases the likelihood of avoiding peak hour travel for both work and non-work related travel. However, for homeworkers who also conduct work from their workplace on the same day (part-day telework), there is no reduction in daily travel time, and avoiding peak hour travel is limited to work-related travel. Working from other locations such as cafés/libraries or vehicles increases the likelihood of not traveling at peak hours. Findings also indicate that morning peak periods are more affected by work location decisions than evening peak periods. A survival analysis of daily departure times for both full-day and part-day homeworkers provides insight into this mechanism.

m3bjpdvd,,WHO,Cross-Sectional Evaluation of Humoral Responses against SARS-CoV-2 Spike,,,,unk,"SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, infecting millions of people and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths. The Spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 mediate viral entry and are the main targets for neutralizing antibodies. Understanding the antibody response directed against SARS-CoV-2 is crucial for the development of vaccine, therapeutic, and public health interventions. Here, we perform a cross-sectional study on 106 SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to evaluate humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 Spike. Most infected individuals elicit anti-Spike antibodies within 2 weeks of the onset of symptoms.

A large portion of our everyday social interactions is non-verbal. Of the sensory modalities we use for non-verbal communication, olfaction (i.e., the sense of smell) is often considered the most enigmatic medium. Outside of our awareness, smells provide information about our identity, emotions, gender, mate compatibility, illness, and potentially more. Yet, body odors are astonishingly complex, with their composition being influenced by various factors. Is there a chemical basis of olfactory communication? Can we identify molecules predictive of psychological states and traits? We propose that answering these questions requires integrating two disciplines: psychology and chemistry. This new field, coined sociochemistry, faces new challenges emerging from the sheer amount of factors causing variability in chemical composition of body odorants on the one hand (e.g., diet, hygiene, skin bacteria, hormones, genes), and variability in psychological states and traits on the other (e.g., genes, culture, hormones, internal state, context). In past research, the reality of these high-dimensional data has been reduced in an attempt to isolate unidimensional factors in small, homogenous samples under tightly controlled settings. Here, we propose big data approaches to establish novel links between chemical and psychological data on a large scale from heterogeneous samples in ecologically valid settings.

METHODS: We created a one-week virtual urology course utilizing interactive lectures, case-based exercises, and faculty-proctored surgical video reviews. Students were assigned self-study modules and participated in case-based discussions and presentations on a topic of their choice. Students’ perceptions of urology as a specialty and the utility of the course was evaluated through pre- and post-course surveys. Understanding of urologic content was evaluated with a multiple-choice exam. RESULTS: A total of nine students were enrolled in the course. All students reported increased understanding of the common urologic diagnoses and of urology as a specialty by an average of 2.6 points (standard deviation 1.2) on a 10-point Likert scale (p= 0.0002). Additionally, 56% of students reported increased interest, 22% reported no change and 22% reported a decreased interest in pursuing urology as a specialty following the course. Students self-reported increased knowledge of a variety of urologic topics on a 10-point Likert scale. The average exam score on the multiple-choice exam improved from 50% before the course to 89% after the course. CONCLUSIONS: Various teaching techniques can be employed through a virtual platform to introduce medical students to the specialty of urology and increase clinical knowledge surrounding common urologic conditions.

ibhhqqvm,,WHO,A work-life conflict perspective on telework,,,,unk,"Telework has been promoted for decades as one of the traffic demand management policies to alleviate congestion during peak periods and reduce work-related trips, along with other benefits. However, less clear is the role played by life stages (i.e., gender, marital status and parenthood) on telework behavior. This study investigated to which extent telework frequency associated with life stages, and how these associations could be explained based on the work-life conflict perspective. Representative data were obtained from German Microcensus 2010 (N = 188,081 participants). The outcome variable was measured as ordered telework participation levels (i.e., never, infrequently and frequently). After testing for multicollinearity, a zero-inflated ordered probit regression model was applied to assess the associations between telework and family-life stages, while adjusting for individual, household, job-related and environmental characteristics. Results suggest that life stages associate with telework behavior in a complex way. Three patterns have been distinguished. Specifically, irrespective of gender and marital status, parents are less likely to telework compared to those without children. Regarding individuals without children, single individuals are more likely to telework than married ones, and males more likely than females. In contrast, for individuals with children, the partnered parents are more likely to telework than single parents, and females more likely than males. Our findings suggest that as the most important feature in family-life stages, children play a vital role in telework behavior. It not only increases both work-to-family conflict and family-to-work conflict, but also triggers housework re-division within couples and aggravates gender differences. Policies that support formal childcare resources could relieve the family-to-work conflict and encourage people to work at home.",2020,"Zhang, Shihang; Moeckel, Rolf; Moreno, Ana Tsui; Shuai, Bin; Gao, Jie",Transp.

The GI epithelium also contributes to the poor permeability of numerous antioxidant agents. Thus, lipophilic vitamins do not readily dissolve in the GI tract, and therefore they have low bioavailability. Nanomedicine has the potential to improve the delivery efficiency of oral vitamins. In particular, the use of lipid nanocarriers for certain vitamins that are administered orally can provide improved solubility, chemical stability, epithelium permeability and bioavailability, half-life, nidus targeting, and fewer adverse effects. These lipid nanocarriers include self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDSs), nanoemulsions, microemulsions, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). The use of nontoxic excipients and sophisticated material engineering of lipid nanosystems allows for control of the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles and improved GI permeation via mucosal or lymphatic transport. In this review, we highlight recent progress in the development of lipid nanocarriers for vitamin delivery. In addition, the same lipid nanocarriers used for vitamins may also be effective as carriers of vitamin derivatives, and therefore enhance their oral bioavailability. One example is the incorporation of d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) as the emulsifier in lipid nanocarriers to increase the solubility and inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux.

All ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Few studies had reported milder course in children however, severe course of illness has been reported. We aimed to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 in pediatric patients including diagnostic findings and therapeutic interventions in sever disease manifestation. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 742 patients with SARS-CoV-2 proven infection at King Abdullah Specialist Children’s Hospital, from April 2020 and July 2020. Inpatients, outpatient, including those with sever manifestation treated at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were included. We collected data including demographic data, comorbidities, symptoms, imaging data, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: Among of 742 patients, 71 (9.6%) were hospitalized. The median age of patients was 75 months old and 53.6 were male. A total of 461 (62.1%) had close contact with confirmed cases, 45 (6.1%) had no contact history, and 236 (31.8%) with unknown exposure risk. The most common symptoms at the onset of illness were fever (32.5%), respiratory symptoms (21%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (10.3%). Among the entire cohort, 7 patients were admitted to PICU with COVID-19 related symptoms, five patients diagnosed with MIS-C, one patient with Kawasaki, and one patient with pneumonia. All patients received supportive therapy, no antiviral treatment had been used however, in MIS-C patients IVIG had been given to all patients, five patients received Anakinra; and one patient received tocilizumab. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, children infected with SARS-CoV-2 are less likely to develop symptomatic or serious diseases.

Participants later rated the perceived accuracy of a larger set of headlines that included previously rated and new headlines. In both experiments, prior exposure increased perceived accuracy for participants who made initial interest ratings, but not for participants who made initial truthfulness ratings. The increase in perceived accuracy that accompanies repeated exposure was attenuated when participants considered the accuracy of the headlines at initial exposure. Experiment 2 also found evidence for a political bias: participants rated politically concordant headlines as more accurate than politically discordant headlines. The magnitude of this bias was related to performance on a cognitive reflection test; more analytic participants demonstrated greater political bias.

The aim of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures on upper stenting during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, as well as the use of personal protection equipment (PPE) and risk of contamination for patients and staff. Patients and methods This was a multicenter, retrospective study of consecutive patients who underwent stent placement for upper gastrointestinal obstruction during the second half of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak period in comparison to same period one year before. Results A total of 29 stents were placed for upper gastrointestinal obstruction during the study period, corresponding to an increase of 241 % comparing to the same period in 2019 (n = 12). No significant major differences were found between the two time periods regarding patients’ baseline characteristics, post-stenting management and number of staff involved in stent placement. Fellows’ involvement was significantly lower in 2020 compared to 2019 (21 % vs 67 %; P = 0.01).

Here we analyzed the effects of apilimod, a PIKfyve inhibitor that was reported to be well tolerated in humans in phase 2 clinical trials, for its effects on entry and infection of EBOV and Marburg virus (MARV). We first found that apilimod blocks infections by EBOV and MARV in Huh 7, Vero E6 and primary human macrophage cells, with notable potency in the macrophages (IC(50), 10 nM). We next observed that similar doses of apilimod block EBOV-glycoprotein-virus like particle (VLP) entry and transcription-replication competent VLP infection, suggesting that the primary mode of action of apilimod is as an entry inhibitor, preventing release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication. After providing evidence that the anti-EBOV action of apilimod is via PIKfyve, we showed that it blocks trafficking of EBOV VLPs to endolysosomes containing Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), the intracellular receptor for EBOV. Concurrently apilimod caused VLPs to accumulate in early endosome antigen 1-positive endosomes. We did not detect any effects of apilimod on bulk endosome acidification, on the activity of cathepsins B and L, or on cholesterol export from endolysosomes. Hence by antagonizing PIKfyve, apilimod appears to block EBOV trafficking to its site of fusion and entry into the cytoplasm. Given the drug’s observed anti-filoviral activity, relatively unexplored mechanism of entry inhibition, and reported tolerability in humans, we propose that apilimod be further explored as part of a therapeutic regimen to treat filoviral infections.",2017-04-12,"Nelson, Elizabeth A.; Dyall, Julie; Hoenen, Thomas; Barnes, Alyson B.; Zhou, Huanying; Liang, Janie Y.; Michelotti, Julia; Dewey, William H.; DeWald, Lisa Evans; Bennett, Richard S.; Morris, Patrick J.; Guha, Rajarshi; Klumpp-Thomas, Carleen; McKnight, Crystal; Chen, Yu-Chi; Xu, Xin; Wang, Amy; Hughes, Emma; Martin, Scott; Thomas, Craig; Jahrling, Peter B.; Hensley, Lisa E.; Olinger, Gene G.; White, Judith M.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/9018234c987db8e1aec9ca3cae1806b75e4835ad.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5402990.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5402990/,

However, the mechanism of NG‐induced enhanced HIV‐1 transmission is unknown. METHODS: (a) The cervical tissues were exposed to NG, and cytokine induction was monitored by measuring cytokine proteins in culture supernatants and cytokine mRNAs in tissues. (b) Transcription and replication of HIV‐1 in TZM‐bl, U1, and ACH2 cells were measured by Beta‐Gal activity and p24 proteins in the supernatant, respectively. (c) HIV‐1 transmission was assayed in an organ culture system by measuring transmitted HIV‐1 in supernatant and HIV‐1 gag mRNA in the tissues. (d) Transcriptome analysis was done using second generation sequencing. RESULTS: (a) NG induced membrane ruffling of epithelial layer, caused migration of CD3+ cells to the intraepithelial region, and induced high levels of inflammatory cytokines IL‐1β and TNF‐α. (b) NG‐induced supernatants (NGIS) increased HIV‐1 transcription, induced HIV‐1 from latently infected cells, and increased transmission of HIV‐1 across cervical mucosa. (c) Transcriptome analysis of the epithelial layer of the tissues exposed to NG, and HIV‐1 showed significant upregulation of CXCL10 and IL8. IL‐1β increased the induction of CXCL10 and IL‐8 expression in cervical mucosa with a concomitant increase in HIV‐1 transmission. CONCLUSION: We present a model in which IL‐1β produced from cervical epithelium during NG exposure increases CXCL10 and IL8 in epithelia. This in turn causes upon HIV‐1 infection, the migration of HIV‐1 target cells toward the subepithelium, resulting in increased HIV‐1 transcription in the sub‐mucosa and subsequent enhancement of transmission across cervical mucosa.",2019-04-11,"Sanyal, Anwesha; Shen, Chengli; Ding, Ming; Reinhart, Todd A.; Chen, Yue; Sankapal, Soni; Gupta, Phalguni",Am J Reprod Immunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/39c58dbaa3f69e91698b2efe6d3b12504aa3904d.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6540971.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1111/aji.13111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30903720/,85455768.0

The genomes were assembled into telomere-to-telomere chromosomes and a consistent set of gene predictions was generated. The genomes of both subspecies were largely co-linear, and especially the chromosome ends differed in gene model content between the two subspecies. A single large cluster of repeats was found on each chromosome at the same respective position in all strains, harbouring nearly 50% of all repeats and likely representing centromeres. Repeats were all heavily methylated. Finally, a mapping population of var. burnettii confirmed an even distribution of crossovers in meiosis, contrasting the recombination landscape of var. bisporus.

We compared efficacy and safety of the Trevo Retriever, a new stent-like device, with its US Food and Drug Administration-cleared predecessor, the Merci Retriever. METHODS In this open-label randomised controlled trial, we recruited patients at 26 sites in the USA and one in Spain. We included adults aged 18-85 years with angiographically confirmed large vessel occlusion strokes and US National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores of 8-29 within 8 h of symptom onset. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) with sequentially numbered sealed envelopes to thrombectomy with Trevo or Merci devices. Randomisation was stratified by age (≤68 years vs 69-85 years) and NIHSS scores (≤18 vs 19-29) with alternating blocks of various sizes. The primary efficacy endpoint, assessed by an unmasked core laboratory, was thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) scores of 2 or greater reperfusion with the assigned device alone. The primary safety endpoint was a composite of procedure-related adverse events. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01270867. FINDINGS Between Feb 3, 2011, and Dec 1, 2011, we randomly assigned 88 patients to the Trevo Retriever group and 90 patients to Merci Retriever group. 76 (86%) patients in the Trevo group and 54 (60%) in the Merci group met the primary endpoint after the assigned device was used (odds ratio 4·22, 95% CI 1·92-9·69; p(superiority)<0·0001).

Ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed the replication of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in cultured cells. The 90% effective concentration (EC90) of ciclesonide for SARS-CoV-2 in differentiated human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells was 0.55 µM. Eight consecutive passages of 43 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the presence of ciclesonide generated 15 resistant mutants harboring single amino acid substitutions in nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) or nsp4. Of note, ciclesonide suppressed the replication of all these mutants by 90% or more, suggesting that these mutants cannot completely overcome ciclesonide blockade. Under a microscope, the viral RNA replication-transcription complex in cells, which is thought to be detectable using antibodies specific for nsp3 and double-stranded RNA, was observed to fall in the presence of ciclesonide in a concentration-dependent manner. These observations indicate that the suppressive effect of ciclesonide on viral replication is specific to coronaviruses, highlighting it as a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.IMPORTANCE The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is ongoing. New and effective antiviral agents that combat the disease are needed urgently. Here, we found that an inhaled corticosteroid, ciclesonide, suppresses the replication of coronaviruses, including betacoronaviruses (murine hepatitis virus type 2 [MHV-2], MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) and an alphacoronavirus (human coronavirus 229E [HCoV-229E]), in cultured cells. Ciclesonide is safe; indeed, it can be administered to infants at high concentrations. Thus, ciclesonide is expected to be a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is effective against many members of the coronavirus family.

In Italy, these effects have been particularly pronounced. While research on the COVID-19 outbreak has mainly focused on the clinical features of infected patients and the psychological impact on the general population and health professionals, no investigation has yet assessed the psychological impact of the pandemic on parents. In the present research, we conducted a web-based survey of Italian parents to examine the prevalence of parenting-related exhaustion—and to identify its associated risk and protective factors—4 weeks into the lockdown. METHODS: A total of 1,226 parents provided their consent to participate in the study and completed a demographic questionnaire, information relating to particular COVID-19 experiences, and measures of emotional exhaustion, parental resilience, social connections, and psychological distress during the lockdown. RESULTS: Seventeen percent of our sample experienced significant parenting-related exhaustion, with mothers more severely affected. Multiple regression analyses showed that greater parenting-related exhaustion was predicted by psychological distress, lower parental resilience, motherhood, fewer perceived social connections, and being single, as well as having a child with special needs, having a large number of children, and having younger children. CONCLUSION: The findings add further support to the call for preventive programs to support parents throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

This technique has been used for a variety of procedures and has recently been proposed for colonic resections as well. We report our preliminary experience of right colectomy, performed through a SILS approach. Five patients (3 males, 2 females, mean age 81.6 years) were selected to undergo SILS right colectomy for cancer. The procedure was carried out through a SILS multi-port device (SILS™ Port, Covidien Ltd, Norwalk, CT, USA), with either conventional or specially designed instruments. A medial-to-lateral approach and an extra-corporeal anastomosis were performed. In three cases, the procedure was completed through the SILS technique; in two of these cases a combined procedure was carried out (right colectomy plus cholecystectomy, right colectomy plus cholecystectomy plus i.o. colonoscopy and polypectomy). In one case, a switch to standard laparoscopy was necessary because of the large dimension of the tumour, while in the other case an intolerance of pneumoperitoneum was registered, thus requiring a conversion to open surgery. SILS procedures proved to be oncologically correct. No major complications occurred. In selected patients, SILS right colectomy for cancer appears to be feasible and oncologically safe. Beyond the cosmetic advantage, the procedure may reduce postoperative morbidity.

d1okup5t,,WHO,Adapting Policy Guidelines for Spine Surgeries During COVID-19 Pandemic in View of Evolving Evidences: An Early Experience From a Tertiary Care Teaching Hospital,,,,unk,"Introduction The recent novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought the world to a standstill. This outbreak not only affected healthcare systems but the resultant economic losses were also enormous. COVID-19 has demanded that the health care systems globally evolve, develop new strategies, identify new models of functioning, and at times, fall back on the old conservative methods of orthopedic care to decrease the risk of disease transmission. Although, the majority of hospitals are refraining from performing elective surgeries, emergent and urgent procedures cannot be delayed. Various strategies have been developed at the institute level to reduce the risk of infection transmission among the theatre team from an unsuspected patient (asymptomatic and presymptomatic) during the perioperative period. Material and methods The present study is a part of an ongoing project which is being conducted in a tertiary level hospital after obtaining research review board approval. All patients admitted either for vertebral fracture or spinal cord compression from February 2020 to May 2020 were included. The present study included 13 patients (nine males and four females) with an average age of 35.4 years The oldest patient was of 63 years which is considered a risk factor for developing severe COVID-19 infection. Results Eight patients (61.5%) presented with spinal cord injury (SCI) due to vertebral fracture with fall from height (87.5%) as the most common etiology. Among the traumatic SCI patients, six (75%) were managed surgically with posterior decompression and instrumented fusion with pedicle screws while two patients (25%) were managed conservatively. There were four patients (30.8%) of tuberculosis of the spine of whom two (50%) were managed with posterior decompression, debridement, and stabilization with pedicle screws, samples for culture, biopsy, and cartridge-based nucleic acid amplification test (CBNAAT) were collected during the procedure; for the remaining two patients (50%), a trans-pedicular biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis for initiation of anti-tubercular therapy. Prolapsed intervertebral disc causing cauda equina syndrome was the reason for emergency surgery in one patient (7.7%). COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test was performed in four patients (30.8%), in whom the most common symptom was fever (two patients (50%)). These patients were residents of high prevalence area for COVID-19 infection. Sore throat (25%), fatigue (25%), and low oxygen saturation (25%) were present in one patient which prompted us to get the COVID-19 test. All patients were reported negative for COVID-19. Conclusion The structural organization and the management protocol we describe allowed us to reduce infection risk and ultimately hospital stay, thereby maximizing the already stretched available medical resources. These precautions helped us to reduce transmission and exposure to COVID-19 in health care workers (HCW) and patients in our institute. The aim of this article is that our early experience can be of value to the medical communities that will soon be in a similar situation.",2020,"Verma, Virendra; Nagar, Manoj; Jain, Vaibhav; Santoshi, John A; Dwivedi, Manish; Behera, Prateek; Selvanayagam, Rajkumar; Pal, Dharm; Singh, Kuldeep",Cureus,,#679785,,,,,221096298.0

We studied pertussis in hospitalized infants as related to gestational age (GA) and vaccination history. METHODS: Medical record data of 0-2y old patients hospitalized for pertussis during 2005–2014 were linked to vaccination data. Multivariable logistic regression was used to study the association between GA and vaccination history on the clinical disease course. We compared vaccine effectiveness (VE) against hospitalization for pertussis between term and preterm infants (i.e., <37w GA) using the screening method as developed by Farrington. RESULTS: Of 1187 records, medical data from 676 were retrieved. Of these, 12% concerned preterms, whereas they are 8% of Dutch birth cohorts. Median age at admission was 3 m for preterms and 2 m for terms (p < 0.001). Preterms more often had received pertussis vaccination (62% vs 44%; p = 0.01) and more often had coinfections (37% vs 21%; p = 0.01). Preterms tended more often to have complications, to require artificial respiration or to need admittance to the intensive care unit (ICU). Preterms had longer ICU stays (15d vs 9d; p = 0.004). Vaccinated preterms and terms had a lower median length of hospital stay and lower crude risks of apneas and the need for artificial respiration, additional oxygen, and ICU admittance than those not vaccinated. After adjustment for presence of coinfections and age at admittance, these differences were not significant, except the lower need of oxygen treatment in vaccinated terms. Effectiveness of the first vaccination against pertussis hospitalizations was 95% (95% CI 93–96%) and 73% (95% CI 20–91%) in terms and preterms, respectively. Effectiveness of the second dose of the primary vaccination series was comparable in both groups (86 and 99%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Infants hospitalized for pertussis suffer from severe disease. Preterms were overrepresented, with higher need for intensive treatment and less VE of first vaccination. These findings stress the need for alternative prevention, in particular prenatal vaccination of mothers, to reduce pertussis in both groups.",2019-10-29,"van der Maas, Nicoline A.

The “gold standard” in immunotherapy has been the development of a tumor-specific CD8 T cell response to potentiate tumor clearance and immunological memory. While many advances have been made in the field of immunotherapy, few therapies have seen true success. Many of the same principles used to develop immunotherapy in tumors of the peripheral organs have been applied to brain tumor immunotherapy. The immune-specialized nature of the brain should call into question whether this approach is appropriate. Recent results from our own experiments require a rethinking of current dogma.

The clinical presentation of the SARS-CoV-2 varies between a subclinical or flu-like syndrome to that of severe pneumonia with multi-organ failure and death. Initial reports have suggested that cancer patients may have a higher susceptibility to get infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus but current evidence remains poor as it is biased by important confounders. Patients with ongoing or recent cancer treatment for advanced active disease, metastatic solid tumors and hematological malignancies are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 respiratory disease that requires hospitalization and have a poorer disease outcome compared to individuals without cancer. However it is not clear whether these are independent risk factors, or mainly driven by male gender, age, obesity, performance status, uncontrolled diabetes, cardiovascular disease and various other medical conditions. These often have a greater influence on the probability to die due to SARS-CoV-2 then cancer. Delayed diagnosis and suboptimal cancer management due to the pandemic results in disease upstaging and has considerable impact cancer on specific death rates. Surgery during the peak of the pandemic seems to increase mortality, but there is no convincing evidence that adjuvant systemic cancer therapy and radiotherapy are contraindicated, implicating that cancer treatment can be provided safely after individual risk/benefit assessment and some adaptive measures. Underlying immunosuppression, elevated cytokine levels, altered expression of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) and TMPRSS2, and a prothrombotic status may fuel the effects of a SARS-CoV-2 in some cancer patients, but have the potential to be used as biomarkers for severe disease and therapeutic targets.

So far as a result of this epidemic, 4,434,653 confirmed cases and 302,169 deaths are reported. The growing infection rate and death toll demand the use of all possible approaches to design novel drugs and vaccines to curb this disease. In this study, we combined drugs repurposing and virtual drug screening strategies to target 3CLpro, which has an essential role in viral maturation and replication. A total of 31 FDA approved anti-HIV drugs, and Traditional Chinese medicines (TCM) database were screened to find potential inhibitors. As a result, Saquinavir, and five drugs (TCM5280805, TCM5280445, TCM5280343, TCM5280863, and TCM5458190) from the TCM database were found as promising hits. Furthermore, results from molecular dynamics simulation and total binding free energy revealed that Saquinavir and TCM5280805 target the catalytic dyad (His41 and Cys145) and possess stable dynamics behavior. Thus, we suggest that these compounds should be tested experimentally against the SARS-COV-2 as Saquinavir has been reported to inhibit HIV protease experimentally.

Methods: We used a multimodal electrophysiological approach combined with neuropsychological investigations to study functional alteration of both the PNS and CNS in four patients with severe COVID-19. Results: We found electrophysiological evidence for affection of both the PNS and CNS, and particularly affection of brain stem function. Furthermore, our neuropsychological investigations provide evidence of marked impairment of cognition independent of delirium, and outlasting the duration of acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: This case series provides first direct electrophysiological evidence for functional brain stem involvement in COVID-19 patients without evident morphological changes supporting the notion of the brain stem contributing to respiratory failure and thus promoting severe courses of the disease.

The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of the disease are not completely elucidated. Thus, we aim to understand host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection by comparing samples collected from two distinct compartments (infection site and blood), obtained from COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls. Methods We used two publicly available gene expression datasets generated via RNA sequencing in two different samples; nasopharyngeal swabs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We performed a differential gene expression analysis between COVID-19 subjects and healthy controls in the two datasets and then functionally profiled their differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The genes involved in innate immunity were also determined. Results We found a clear difference in the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between the two sample groups. In COVID-19 subjects, the nasopharyngeal sample group indicated upregulation of genes involved in cytokine activity and interferon signalling pathway, as well as downregulation of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and viral transcription. Host response in COVID-19 subjects for the PBMC group, involved upregulation of genes involved in the complement system and immunoglobulin mediated immune response. CXCL13, GABRE, IFITM3 were upregulated and HSPA1B was downregulated in COVID-19 subjects in both sample groups. Conclusion Our results indicate the host response to SARS-CoV-2 is compartmentalized and suggests potential biomarkers of response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Highlights Transcriptomic profiling from publicly available RNA-seq count data revealed a site-specific immune response in COVID-19. Host response was found cellular-mediated in nasopharyngeal samples and humoral-mediated in PBMCs samples.

as3drxf1,,WHO,Novel defect in phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type 2-alpha (PI4K2A) at the membrane-enzyme interface is associated with metabolic cutis laxa,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Inherited cutis laxa, or inelastic, sagging skin is a genetic condition of premature and generalized connective tissue aging, affecting various elastic components of the extracellular matrix. Several cutis laxa syndromes are inborn errors of metabolism and lead to severe neurological symptoms. PATIENT AND METHODS: In a patient with cutis laxa, a choreoathetoid movement disorder, dysmorphic features and intellectual disability we performed exome sequencing to elucidate the underlying genetic defect. We identified the amino acid substitution R275W in phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type II&#945;, caused by a homozygous missense mutation in the PI4K2A gene. We used lipidomics, complexome profiling and functional studies to measure phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate synthesis in the patient and evaluated PI4K2A deficient mice to define a novel metabolic disorder. RESULTS: The R275W residue, located on the surface of the protein, is involved in forming electrostatic interactions with the membrane. The catalytic activity of PI4K2A in patient fibroblasts was severely reduced and lipid mass spectrometry showed that particular acyl-chain pools of PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 were decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Phosphoinositide lipids play a major role in intracellular signalling and trafficking and regulate the balance between proliferation and apoptosis. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases such as PI4K2A mediate the first step in the main metabolic pathway that generates PI4P, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 . Although neurologic involvement is common, cutis laxa has not been reported previously in metabolic defects affecting signalling. Here we describe a patient with a complex neurological phenotype, premature aging and a mutation in PI4K2A, illustrating the importance of this enzyme in the generation of inositol lipids with particular acylation characteristics.

The acute disease bears many similarities both clinically and, potentially, mechanistically, to the systemic diseases caused by bacteria, rickettsia, and viruses. Traditionally the morbidity and mortality associated with severe malarial disease has been explained in terms of mechanical obstruction to vascular flow by adherence to endothelium (termed sequestration) of erythrocytes containing mature-stage parasites. However, over the past few decades an alternative ‘cytokine theory of disease’ has also evolved, where malarial pathology is explained in terms of a balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The final common pathway for this pro-inflammatory imbalance is believed to be a limitation in the supply and mitochondrial utilisation of energy to cells. Different patterns of ensuing energy depletion (both temporal and spatial) throughout the cells in the body present as different clinical syndromes. This chapter draws attention to the over-arching position that inflammatory cytokines are beginning to occupy in the pathogenesis of acute malaria and other acute infections. The influence of inflammatory cytokines on cellular function offers a molecular framework to explain the multiple clinical syndromes that are observed during acute malarial illness, and provides a fresh avenue of investigation for adjunct therapies to ameliorate the malarial disease process.",2007,"Clark, Ian A.; Griffiths, Michael J.",Pediatric Infectious Diseases Revisited,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e4b3a3eca98196afdb6a407514afdaa36c951f23.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7123729/,

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results after laparoscopic surgery in patients with symptomatic rectocele and III/IV stage vaginal vault prolapse METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of women with symptomatic rectoceles and middle compartment prolapse operated on between 2013 and 2015, who underwent a laparoscopic sacrocolpoperineopexy with synthetic Y mesh attached to puborectalis muscles, the anterior and posterior vagina wall and the sacrum. The clinical outcomes measured were symptoms of prolapse, obstructive defecation syndrome and quality of life. Radiological outcomes were distance of the vaginal vault below pubococcigeal line and depth of rectovaginal wall protrusion in dynamic pelvic resonance. RESULTS 33 patients were included. 32 of them remained asymptomatic after a three years follow-up. Significant differences were shown in the obstructed defecation score and quality of life after 6, 12 and 36 months compared to preoperatively. No differences were identified when the postoperative results were compared. Significant differences were shown in preoperative vaginal vault prolapse (3.2 cms ± 0.8 SD below the pubococcigeal Line) and rectocele size, compared with 1 and 3 years after surgery. There were no significant differences in vaginal vault prolapse when compared after 1 and 3 years. When rectocele size after 1 and 3 years was compared, significant differences were shown, but only one clinical recurrence (3%) was identified after a mean follow-up of 47 months.

In Saudi Arabia recent significant hospital outbreaks, including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have resulted from lack of, or breakdown in, infection prevention and control procedures. This study was designed to assess attitudes to, and awareness of, infection prevention and control policies and guidelines among healthcare workers of different professions and institution types in Saudi Arabia. A questionnaire was administered to 607 healthcare workers including physicians (n = 133), nurses (n = 162), laboratory staff (n = 233) and other staff (n = 79) in government hospitals, private hospitals and poly clinics. Results were compared using Chi square analysis according to profession type, institution type, age group and nationality (Saudi or non-Saudi) to assess variability. Responses suggested that there are relatively high levels of uncertainty among healthcare workers across a range of infection prevention and control issues, including institution-specific issues, surveillance and reporting standards, and readiness and competence to implement policies and respond to outbreaks. There was evidence to suggest that staff in private hospitals and nurses were more confident than other staff types. Carelessness of healthcare workers was the top-cited factor contributing to causes of outbreaks (65.07% of total group), and hospital infrastructure and design was the top-cited factor contributing to spread of infection in the hospital (54.20%), followed closely by lack and shortage of staff (53.71%) and no infection control training program (51.73%).

Data on the effectiveness and safety of the use of methylprednisolone for patients with severe COVID‐19 remain limited. METHODS: In this retrospective study, epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, treatment and outcomes data of hospitalized patients with severe COVID‐19 in Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 1 to 7 March 2020, were collected. Binary logistic regression model was used to analyse risk factors for disease progression from severe COVID‐19 illness to critical illness. The effectiveness and safety of the use of methylprednisolone for patients with severe COVID‐19 disease were evaluated. RESULTS: The results of the multivariate analysis from 175 patients with severe COVID‐19 indicate that the use of methylprednisolone was a protective factor against disease progression from severe to critical illness(P < .001; OR: 0.054 95% CI: 0.017‐0.173). Among patients with severe COVID‐19 aged < 65 years, both the proportion of patients who progressed to critical illness (42.2% vs 90.0%, P = .000) and the mortality(6.7% vs 30.0%, P = .002) were lower for patients in methylprednisolone group, compared with those in the non‐methylprednisolone group, whereas no statistical differences between the methylprednisolone group and the non‐methylprednisolone group were found among patients with COVID‐19 older than 65 years. Moreover, both the levels of CD4(+) T lymphocyte counts (646 vs 463/µL, P = .007) and IL‐6 (241.9 vs 82.8 pg/mL, P = .025) were higher among patients with severe COVID‐19 aged < 65 years, compared with those patients ≥ 65 years old.

There are two families of detectors: the first family detects more objects but with imprecise bounding boxes, while those of the second family do the opposite. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by combining the two families, in a way similar to classifier combination. Our solution has been validated through the combination of two famous detectors, Faster R-CNN which detects more objects and YOLO which produces accurate bounding boxes.

However, it is not clear to what extent these measures explain the low numbers of recorded COVID-19 cases and deaths in Africa. One of the main aims of control measures is to reduce respiratory pathogen transmission through direct contact with others. In this study, we collect contact data from residents of informal settlements around Nairobi, Kenya, to assess if control measures have changed contact patterns, and estimate the impact of changes on the basic reproduction number (R(0)). METHODS: We conducted a social contact survey with 213 residents of five informal settlements around Nairobi in early May 2020, 4 weeks after the Kenyan government introduced enhanced physical distancing measures and a curfew between 7 pm and 5 am. Respondents were asked to report all direct physical and non-physical contacts made the previous day, alongside a questionnaire asking about the social and economic impact of COVID-19 and control measures. We examined contact patterns by demographic factors, including socioeconomic status. We described the impact of COVID-19 and control measures on income and food security. We compared contact patterns during control measures to patterns from non-pandemic periods to estimate the change in R(0). RESULTS: We estimate that control measures reduced physical contacts by 62% and non-physical contacts by either 63% or 67%, depending on the pre-COVID-19 comparison matrix used. Masks were worn by at least one person in 92% of contacts. Respondents in the poorest socioeconomic quintile reported 1.5 times more contacts than those in the richest. Eighty-six percent of respondents reported a total or partial loss of income due to COVID-19, and 74% reported eating less or skipping meals due to having too little money for food. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 control measures have had a large impact on direct contacts and therefore transmission, but have also caused considerable economic and food insecurity. Reductions in R(0) are consistent with the comparatively low epidemic growth in Kenya and other sub-Saharan African countries that implemented similar, early control measures.

In Togo, where four in five people practice self-medication, the absence of a cure for COVID-19 and the constant progression of the disease requires an assessment of self-medication patterns in the context of the pandemic. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of self-medication to prevent COVID-19 and its associated factors in Lomé, Togo. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Lomé, the capital city of Togo, from April 23rd to May 8th, 2020, with a sample of participants from five sectors: the healthcare, air transport, police, road transport and informal sectors. The participants were invited to provide information about their self-medication practices to prevent COVID-19 in the 2 weeks preceding the survey. RESULTS: A total of 955 participants (71.6% men) with a median age of 36 (IQR 32–43) were included. Approximately 22.1% were in the air transport sector, 20.5% were in the police sector, and 38.7% were in the health sector. The overall prevalence of self-medication to prevent COVID-19 was 34.2% (95% CI: 31.2–37.3%). The most commonly used products were vitamin C (27.6%) and traditional medicine (10.2%). Only 2.0% of participants reported using chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. Female sex (aOR=1.90; p< 0.001), work in the health sector (aOR=1.89; p= 0.001), secondary education level (aOR= 2.28; p= 0.043) and university education level (aOR= 5.11; p< 0.001) were associated with self-medication.

Whether the round ligament of uterus should be divided to facilitate mesh placement remains controversial. This study aims to review the outcomes of laparoscopic total extraperitoneal (TEP) groin hernia repair in women and to evaluate the impact of division of round ligament. Methods: Consecutive female patients with inguinal or femoral hernias who underwent elective laparoscopic TEP repair at a single institution from 2006 to 2017 were included for retrospective analysis. Primary outcomes were postoperative pain, genital prolapse, and recurrence. Outcomes of patients who had the round ligament divided were further compared with those with round ligament preserved and multivariable adjusted analysis was performed. Results: Sixty-eight patients with a total of 77 TEP repairs were included in the 12-year study period. The mean age was 45 ± 16 years old. Incidental femoral hernia was identified in 4 patients (5.9%). There was 1 (1.3%) recurrence upon mean follow-up of 42.9 ± 37.3 months. The round ligament was divided in 67.5% of patients, and upon multivariable adjusted analysis, there were no statistically significant differences in outcomes in terms of chronic pain (odds ratio [OR] = 2.210, P = .357), paresthesia (OR = 0.241, P = .149), and genital prolapse (OR = 0.327, P = .415) when compared with patients with preserved round ligament.

Locus-by-locus F ST analysis, and four different regressions and interval mapping algorithms of QTL analysis were applied to a phenotypic and genotypic dataset previously obtained from 47 artificial recombinant genomes generated between two begomovirus species. Both approaches assigned the determinant of within-host accumulation—previously identified using standard virology approaches—to a region including the 5׳ end of the replication-associated protein (Rep) gene and the upstream intergenic region.

Here, we investigated the effect of ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker glibenclamide on levcromakalim-induced headache in healthy volunteers. METHODS In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way cross-over study, 15 healthy volunteers aged 18-40 years were randomly allocated to receive glibenclamide and levcromakalim (day 1), glibenclamide and placebo (day 2), and placebo and placebo (day 3) on three different days separated by at least 1 week. The primary endpoints were the difference in incidence of headache and the difference in area under the curve for headache intensity scores (0-12 hours) between the days. RESULTS Fifteen healthy volunteers completed the 3 days of the study. More participants (12/15, 80%) developed headache on the glibenclamide-levcromakalim day compared to the glibenclamide-placebo day (5/15, 33%) (p = 0.01; mean difference 47%; 95% confidence interval 18-75%) and compared to the placebo-placebo day (1/15, 7%) (p = 0.001; mean difference 73%; 95% confidence interval 48-99%). We found no difference in headache incidence between glibenclamide-placebo day and placebo-placebo day (p = 0.12; mean difference 27%; 95% confidence interval 1.3-52%). The area under the curve for headache intensity was significantly larger on the glibenclamide-levcromakalim day compared to the glibenclamide-placebo day (p = 0.003); and compared to the placebo-placebo day (p = 0.001). We found no difference in the area under the curve between the glibenclamide-placebo day compared to the placebo-placebo day (p = 0.07). The median time to onset for headache after levcromakalim infusion with glibenclamide pretreatment was delayed (180 min) compared to levcromakalim without pretreatment (30 min) from a previously published study. CONCLUSION Glibenclamide administration did not cause headache, and glibenclamide pretreatment did not prevent levcromakalim-induced headache.

Herein, we describe the design, fabrication, and testing of a cupric oxide anti-SARS-CoV-2 coating. Rapid loss of infectivity is an important design criterion, so a porous hydrophilic coating was created to allow rapid infiltration of aqueous solutions into the coating where diffusion distances to the cupric oxide surface are short and the surface area is large. The coating was deposited onto glass from a dispersion of cuprous oxide in ethanol and then thermally treated at 700 °C for 2 h to produce a CuO coating that is &#8776;30 µm thick.

Dairy cows in a negative energy balance have an increased risk of developing clinical or subclinical ketosis. The ketosis in dairy cows has a negative impact on milk production, dry matter intake, health, immunity, and reproductive performance. Propylene glycol can be used as an important gluconeogenesis in ruminants and can effectively inhibit the formation of ketones. Supplementary propylene glycol to dairy cows during perinatal is an effective method to alleviate the negative energy balance. This review summarizes the reasons and consequences of negative energy balance as well as the mechanism and effects of propylene glycol in inhibiting a negative energy balance in dairy cows. In addition, the feeding levels and methods of using propylene glycol to alleviate negative energy balance are also discussed. ABSTRACT: With the improvement in the intense genetic selection of dairy cows, advanced management strategies, and improved feed quality and disease control, milk production level has been greatly improved. However, the negative energy balance (NEB) is increasingly serious at the postpartum stage because the intake of nutrients cannot meet the demand of quickly improved milk production. The NEB leads to a large amount of body fat mobilization and consequently the elevated production of ketones, which causes metabolic diseases such as ketosis and fatty liver. The high milk production of dairy cows in early lactation aggravates NEB. The metabolic diseases lead to metabolic disorders, a decrease in reproductive performance, and lactation performance decline, seriously affecting the health and production of cows. Propylene glycol (PG) can alleviate NEB through gluconeogenesis and inhibit the synthesis of ketone bodies. In addition, PG improves milk yield, reproduction, and immune performance by improving plasma glucose and liver function in ketosis cows, and reduces milk fat percentage. However, a large dose of PG (above 500 g/d) has toxic and side effects in cows. The feeding method used was an oral drench. The combination of PG with some other additives can improve the effects in preventing ketosis. Overall, the present review summarizes the recent research progress in the impacts of NEB in dairy cows and the properties of PG in alleviating NEB and reducing the risk of ketosis.",2020-08-28,"Zhang, Fan; Nan, Xuemei; Wang, Hui; Zhao, Yiguang; Guo, Yuming; Xiong, Benhai",Animals (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/6103910528bd9b4710a35fdb2b1547e91538104f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7552166.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10091526; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32872233/,221468198.0

This study adopts a public health ecology approach to systematically understand the relationship between urbanisation, urban environmental change and human health in China. METHOD: Remote sensing image analysis, based on night light data at five different time periods in recent decades, was used to determine changes to the overall urban area. Through a review of the evidence on the relationships between environmental health, urbanisation and health, we advance a pathway framework for explaining urban human health ecology. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to measure the correlation between disease prevalence and urbanisation level, adding a further dimension to a systemic understanding of urban health. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Urban areas have been increasing spatially, but unevenly, in recent decades, with medium and small cities also expanding rapidly in the past decade. Urbanisation and urban expansion result in changes to land use/coverage change, the urban environment and the residents’ lifestyle, which result in human health problems. Regions with the highest urbanisation level were more inclined to have a high prevalence of chronic disease in recent decades. An ecological public health approach provides insights into the multiple types of data which need to be routinely collected if human disease is not to become a barrier to social and economic development.",2012-06-20,"Li, Xinhu; Wang, Cuiping; Zhang, Guoqin; Xiao, Lishan; Dixon, Jane",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/cd9d628f28e666b72ff3c2a99c5b412ea6bb9e12.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088762.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088762/,
4yagplgn,,WHO,Facade of media and social media during covid-19: A review,,,,unk,"A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) arose in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Soon it spread to other countries worldwide to become a pandemic. Globally, governments enforced quarantine and social distancing measures to prevent the spread of the infection. Mass media and social media platforms played a crucial role in providing information regarding the Coronavirus. Since little is known about COVID-19, various fake news, misinformation and rumours spread across the digital media that panicked people into making panic deci-sions. The rapid spread of misinformation and stories via social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube became a vital concern of the government and public health authorities. Medical misinformation and unver-ifiable content about the COVID-19 pandemic are spreading on social media at an unprecedented pace. Mitigating the advent of rumours and misinformation during the COVID-19 epidemic is crucial, since misinformation and fake news creates panic, fear and anxiety among people, predisposing them to various mental health conditions. Instead of considering social media as a secondary medium, it should be utilised to convey important information. Besides, it allows citizens to address their queries directly. Several governments across the world have taken actions to contain the pandemic of misinformation, yet measures are required to prevent such communication complications.",2020,"Srivastava, Kumar Chandan; Shrivastava, Deepti; Chhabra, Kumar Gaurav; Naqvi, Waqar; Sahu, Arti",Int.

q4mh7k1q,,WHO,Upregulation of TRIAP1 by the lncRNA MFI2-AS1/miR-125a-5p Axis Promotes Thyroid Cancer Tumorigenesis,,,,unk,"Background: Thyroid cancer is a very common endocrine cancer worldwide. How long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) regulates thyroid cancer is elusive. LncRNA MFI2-AS1 has been demonstrated to initiate colorectal cancer. Nevertheless, the role of MFI2-AS1 in thyroid cancer remains unknown. This study aims to determine the roles of MFI2-AS1 in thyroid cancer. Methods: qRT-PCR was used to determine the expression of MFI2-AS1 in thyroid cancer tissues and cells. Proliferation was determined by using CCK8 and colony formation assays. Transwell assay was utilized to analyze migration and invasion. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to confirm the interaction between MFI2-AS1 and miR-125a-5p. Results: MFI2-AS1 was shown to be highly expressed in thyroid cancer tissues and predicted poor prognosis. Knockdown of MFI2-AS1 inhibited proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion of thyroid cancer cells in vitro. Bioinformatics screening identified MFI2-AS1 as the sponge for miR-125a-5p. And miR-125a-5p was further confirmed to target TRIAP1 directly. Our data further demonstrated that MFI2-AS1 promoted TRIAP1 expression via repressing miR-125a-5p. Finally, TRIAP1 was found to be upregulated in thyroid cancer tissues and its restoration reversed the effects of MFI2-AS1 depletion. Conclusion: Our results elucidated a novel mechanism that MFI2-AS1 promotes thyroid cancer progression via the miR-125a-5p/TRIAP1 pathway.",2020,"Yu, Tianyu; Tong, Lingling; Ao, Yu; Zhang, Genmao; Liu, Yunpeng; Zhang, Hejia",Onco Targets Ther,,#32764987,,,,,220969961.0

OBJECTIVES To analyze the effectiveness of treatments recommended in the sepsis guidelines. METHODS In a prospective observational study, we studied all adult patients with severe sepsis from 77 intensive care units. We recorded compliance with four therapeutic goals (central venous pressure 8 mm Hg or greater for persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and/or lactate greater than 36 mg/dl, central venous oxygen saturation 70% or greater for persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation and/or lactate greater than 36 mg/dl, blood glucose greater than or equal to the lower limit of normal but less than 150 mg/dl, and inspiratory plateau pressure less than 30 cm H(2)O for mechanically ventilated patients) and four treatments (early broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid challenge in the event of hypotension and/or lactate greater than 36 mg/dl, low-dose steroids for septic shock, drotrecogin alfa [activated] for multiorgan failure). The primary outcome measure was hospital mortality. The effectiveness of each treatment was estimated using propensity scores. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of 2,796 patients, 41.6% died before hospital discharge. Treatments associated with lower hospital mortality were early broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment (treatment within 1 hour vs. no treatment within first 6 hours of diagnosis; odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.90; P = 0.008) and drotrecogin alfa (activated) (odds ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-0.84; P = 0.004).

1fhunzlx,,Medline,The internal open reading frame within the nucleocapsid gene of mouse hepatitis virus encodes a structural protein that is not essential for viral replication.,,,8995618.0,unk,"The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) contains a large open reading frame embedded entirely within the 5' half of its nucleocapsid (N) gene. This internal gene (designated I) is in the +1 reading frame with respect to the N gene, and it encodes a mostly hydrophobic 23-kDa polypeptide. We have found that this protein is expressed in MHV-infected cells and that it is a previously unrecognized structural protein of the virion. To analyze the potential biological importance of the I gene, we disrupted its expression by site-directed mutagenesis using targeted RNA recombination. The start codon for I was replaced by a threonine codon, and a stop codon was introduced at a short interval downstream. Both alterations created silent changes in the N reading frame. In vitro translation studies showed that these mutations completely abolished synthesis of I protein, and immunological analysis of infected cell lysates confirmed this conclusion. The MHV I mutant was viable and grew to high titer. However, the I mutant had a reduced plaque size in comparison with its isogenic wild-type counterpart, suggesting that expression of I confers some minor growth advantage to the virus. The engineered mutations were stable during the course of experimental infection in mice, and the I mutant showed no significant differences from wild type in its ability to replicate in the brains or livers of infected animals. These results demonstrate that I protein is not essential for the replication of MHV either in tissue culture or in its natural host.",1997,"Fischer, F; Peng, D; Hingley, S T; Weiss, S R; Masters, P S",Journal of virology,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8995618/,23445691.0

We investigated whether medically indicated EEGs performed in acutely ill patients under investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19 report epileptiform abnormalities and whether these are more prevalent in COVID-19 positive than negative patients. Methods: In this retrospective case series, adult COVID-19 inpatient PUIs underwent EEGs for acute encephalopathy and/or seizure-like events. PUIs had 8-channel headband EEGs (Ceribell; 20 COVID-19 positive, 6 COVID-19 negative); 2 more COVID-19 patients had routine EEGs. Overall, 26 Ceribell EEGs, 4 routine and 7 continuous EEG studies were reviewed. EEGs were interpreted by board-certified clinical neurophysiologists (n = 16). EEG findings were correlated with demographic data, clinical presentation and history, and medication usage. Fisher's exact test was used. Results: We included 28 COVID-19 PUIs (30-83 years old), of whom 22 tested positive (63.6% males) and 6 tested negative (33.3% male). The most common indications for EEG, among COVID-19-positive vs COVID-19-negative patients, respectively, were new onset encephalopathy (68.2% vs 33.3%) and seizure-like events (14/22, 63.6%; 2/6, 33.3%), even among patients without prior history of seizures (11/17, 64.7%; 2/6, 33.3%). Sporadic epileptiform discharges (EDs) were present in 40.9% of COVID-19-positive and 16.7% of COVID-19-negative patients; frontal sharp waves were reported in 8/9 (88.9%) of COVID-19-positive patients with EDs and in 1/1 of COVID-19-negative patient with EDs. No electrographic seizures were captured, but 19/22 COVID-19-positive and 6/6 COVID-19-negative patients were given antiseizure medications and/or sedatives before the EEG. Significance_ This is the first preliminary report of EDs in the EEG of acutely ill COVID-19-positive patients with encephalopathy or suspected clinical seizures.

GMVs can increase access to integrative care while providing additional benefits including increased clinician-patient contact time, cost savings, and support with prevention and self-management of chronic conditions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many clinical sites are experimenting with new models of care delivery including virtual GMVs using telehealth. Little research has focused on which clinicians offer this type of care, how the GMV approach affects the ways they practice, and their job satisfaction. Workplace-based interventions have been shown to decrease burnout in individual physicians. We argue that more research is needed to understand if GMVs should be considered among these workplace-based interventions, given their potential benefits to clinician wellbeing. GMVs can benefit clinician wellbeing in multiple ways, including: (1) Extended time with patients; (2) Increased ability to provide team-based care; (3) Understanding patients’ social context and addressing social determinants of health. GMVs can be implemented in a variety of settings in many different ways depending on institutional context, patient needs and clinician preferences. We suggest that GMV programs with adequate institutional support may be beneficial for preventing burnout and improving retention among clinicians and health care teams more broadly, including in integrative health care.

Materials and Methods: Ten lymphoma patients with pneumonia and 12 patients with COVID-19 infections were enrolled from January 15 to March 14, 2020. The clinical features were recorded. All pulmonary lesions on chest CT were assessed for location, shape, density and diffusion degree. Other typical CT features were also evaluated. Results: The most commonly observed patchy lesions were ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and mixed GGOs in both groups. Regarding the diffusion degree, 82% (92/112) of the lesions in the COVID-19 group were relatively limited, while 69% (52/75) of those in the lymphoma group were diffuse (p < 0.001).

This work exposes the development of a system that controls brain–computer interaction when a patient with different abilities undergoes a DAT. To develop the proposed system, TGAM1, i.e., ThinkGear-AM1 series of NeuroSky company, was used, connecting it to an isolated Bluetooth 4.0 communication protocol from a brackish and humid environment, and a Notch Filter was applied to reduce the input noise. In this way, at Definiti Ixtapa-Mexico facilities, we explored the behavior of three children with Infantile Spastic Cerebral Palsy (Experiment 1), as well as the behavior of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and neurotypic children (Experiment 2).

TLR-3 is expressed on myeloid dendritic cells, respiratory epithelium, and macrophages, and appears to play a central role in mediating both the antiviral and inflammatory responses of the innate immunity in combating viral infections. Influenza viruses can effectively inhibit the host's ability to produce interferons, and thereby suppress the immune system's antiviral defence mechanisms. Poly ICLC is a synthetic double stranded RNA comprising of polyriboinosinic-poly ribocytidylic acid (Poly IC) stabilized with l-lysine (L) and carboxymethylcellulose (C). Poly ICLC and liposome-encapsulated Poly ICLC (LE Poly ICLC) are TLR-3 agonists and are potent inducer of interferons and natural killer cells. Intranasal pre-treatment of mice with Poly ICLC and LE Poly ICLC provided high level of protection against lethal challenge with a highly lethal avian H5N1 influenza (HPAI) strain (A/H5N1/chicken/Henan clade 2), and against lethal seasonal influenza A/PR/8/34 [H1N1] and A/Aichi/2 [H3N2] virus strains. The duration of protective antiviral immunity to multiple lethal doses of influenza virus A/PR/8/34 virus had been previously found to persist for up to 3 weeks in mice for LE Poly ICLC and 2 weeks for Poly ICLC. Similarly, pre-treatment of mice with CpG oligonucleotides (TLR-9 agonist) was also found to provide complete protection against influenza A/PR/8/34 infection in mice. RT-PCR analysis of lung tissues of mice treated with Poly ICLC and LE Poly ICLC revealed upregulation of TLR-3 mRNAs gene expression. Taken together, these results do support the potential role of TLR-3 and TLR-9 agonists such as Poly ICLC and LE Poly ICLC in protection against lethal seasonal and HPAI virus infection.",2009-05-26,"Wong, J.P.; Christopher, M.E.; Viswanathan, S.; Karpoff, N.; Dai, X.; Das, D.; Sun, L.Q.; Wang, M.; Salazar, A.M.",Vaccine,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a27ace9c641304b631872c8a0f123b8d54936490.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7115520.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X09001261; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2009.01.048; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X09001261; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19200852/,37319142.0

This study describes how to establish a successful cardio-oncology program, with limited resources, in order to effectively manage the unique care required by this patient population. METHODS: Clinical data was collected from 25 consecutive months. There were four foundational elements to establish a CO program: 1. Clinical program: integrating staff and resources from the Heart and Vascular, and Cancer Centers; 2. Education Program: establishing a platform to educate/advocate with respect to CO; 3. Engagement with professional societies: active engagement allowed for the successful establishment of the proposed CO program; and 4. Research program: establishing data collection modalities/cooperation with other institutions. RESULTS: 474 consecutive patients were treated by our CO program during the first 25 months of operation. Clinical data, information about cancer treatment, cardiovascular co morbidities, cardiac testing and impact of CO management are reported.

We aimed to establish a surgical technique of allogeneic UTx assuming the recovery of a uterus from a deceased donor in cynomolgus macaques. Four allogeneic UTxs were performed in female cynomolgus macaques. Donor surgeries comprised en bloc recovery of organs with iliac vessels on both sides, and/or abdominal aorta/vena cava after sufficient perfusion from one femoral artery or external iliac artery. Before perfusion, 150 mL of whole blood was obtained from the donor for subsequent blood transfusion to the recipient. Four uterine grafts were orthotopically transplanted to recipients. End-to-side anastomosis was performed to the iliac vessels on one side in case 1 and iliac vessels on both sides in case 2; aorto-aorto/cavo-caval anastomosis was performed in cases 3 and 4. Arterial blood flow of the uterine grafts was determined by intraoperative indocyanine green (ICG) angiography.

Most patients are diagnosed with advanced disease, resulting in a very low 5-year survival. Screening may reduce the risk of death from lung cancer. OBJECTIVE To conduct a systematic review of the evidence regarding the benefits and harms of lung cancer screening using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). A multisociety collaborative initiative (involving the American Cancer Society, American College of Chest Physicians, American Society of Clinical Oncology, and National Comprehensive Cancer Network) was undertaken to create the foundation for development of an evidence-based clinical guideline. DATA SOURCES MEDLINE (Ovid: January 1996 to April 2012), EMBASE (Ovid: January 1996 to April 2012), and the Cochrane Library (April 2012). STUDY SELECTION Of 591 citations identified and reviewed, 8 randomized trials and 13 cohort studies of LDCT screening met criteria for inclusion. Primary outcomes were lung cancer mortality and all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes included nodule detection, invasive procedures, follow-up tests, and smoking cessation. DATA EXTRACTION Critical appraisal using predefined criteria was conducted on individual studies and the overall body of evidence. Differences in data extracted by reviewers were adjudicated by consensus. RESULTS Three randomized studies provided evidence on the effect of LDCT screening on lung cancer mortality, of which the National Lung Screening Trial was the most informative, demonstrating that among 53,454 participants enrolled, screening resulted in significantly fewer lung cancer deaths (356 vs 443 deaths; lung cancer−specific mortality, 274 vs 309 events per 100,000 person-years for LDCT and control groups, respectively; relative risk, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.73-0.93; absolute risk reduction, 0.33%; P = .004). The other 2 smaller studies showed no such benefit. In terms of potential harms of LDCT screening, across all trials and cohorts, approximately 20% of individuals in each round of screening had positive results requiring some degree of follow-up, while approximately 1% had lung cancer. There was marked heterogeneity in this finding and in the frequency of follow-up investigations, biopsies, and percentage of surgical procedures performed in patients with benign lesions. Major complications in those with benign conditions were rare.

Though current evidence on the epidemiology of the disease is emerging, very little is known about the predictors of recovery. Objectives: To describe the epidemiology of confirmed COVID-19 patients in the Republic of Korea and identify predictors of recovery. Materials and Methods: Using publicly available data for confirmed COVID-19 cases from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from January 20, 2020, to April 30, 2020, we undertook descriptive analyses of cases stratified by sex, age group, place of exposure, date of confirmation, and province. Correlation was tested among all predictors (sex, age group, place of exposure, and province) with Pearson's correlation coefficient. Associations between recovery from COVID-19 and predictors were estimated using a multivariable logistic regression model. Results: Majority of the confirmed cases were females (56%), 20-29 age group (24.3%), and primarily from three provinces-Gyeongsangbuk-do (36.9%), Gyeonggi-do (20.5%), and Seoul (17.1%). The case fatality ratio was 2.1%, and 41.6% cases recovered. Older patients, patients from provinces such as Daegu, Gyeonggi-do, Gyeongsangbuk-do, Jeju-do, Jeollabuk-do, and Jeollanam-do, and those contracting the disease from healthcare settings had lower recovery.

This capability satisfies investigators' first priority in crime scene investigations, which is determining if a stain is blood. This thread spray method explores the use of evidentiary fabric threads for rapid determination of hemoglobin directly from whole blood within textiles without prior extraction steps. The multiplicity of information that can be derived from the thread spray MS method distinguishes it from the current presumptive Bluestar® method, by enabling the detection of hemoglobin (both α- and β-chains), the heme co-factor and lipids all from a single blood sample. Lipid composition was found to differ for blood samples originating from human, canine, and horse species. The robustness of the thread spray MS method as a forensic analytical platform was evaluated in three ways: (1) its successful applicability to samples previously tested by the Bluestar® presumptive method, offering a confirmatory test without prior sample pre-treatment, (2) successful detection of heme from previously washed fabrics, which demonstrated the unprecedented sensitivity of the thread spray method, and (3) the ability to analyze samples stored under ambient conditions for up to 30 days. These results attest to the potential capabilities of the thread spray MS platform in forensic serology, and its application for direct analysis of evidentiary garments, which confer the advantages of rapid analysis and the reduction of the false positive and negative identification rates for blood on textiles.",2020-07-07,"Jackson, Sierra; Frey, Benjamin S; Bates, Maia N; Swiner, Devin J; Badu-Tawiah, Abraham K",The Analyst,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0an00857e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633747/,220389537.0

However, data concerning the performance parameters of commercially available high-throughput ELISA tests are still not available on a large scale. STUDY DESIGN: In our study, we have evaluated an in-house developed ELISA for the detection of the immunoglobulin classes A, G and M directed against the full-length spike glycoprotein from SARS-CoV-2. For this analysis, we have included 110 sera from patients presenting with COVID-19 symptoms or blood donors without symptoms collected at the Austrian Red Cross, Blood Transfusion Service for Upper Austria, Linz. In addition, we have selected four commercially available IgG-based ELISAs as well as one IgA/IgG-based ELISA for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens as well as a multiplexed IgG-based micro-ELISA assay developed for rapid Point of Care testing applications. CONCLUSIONS: All assays evaluated in the course of this study demonstrated suitable sensitivity and specificity values for the identification of patients that have experienced a past infection with SARS-CoV-2.

Choice of mesh and fixation methods are considered crucial issues in preventing recurrences and complications. Lightweight meshes are considered the first choice due to their biomechanical properties and the ability to integrate into the abdominal wall. Titanium helicoidal tacks still represent the ""gold standard"" for mesh fixation, even if they have been suggested to be involved in the genesis of post-operative pain and complications. Recently, absorbable tacks have been introduced, under the hypothesis that there will be no need to maintain a permanent fixation device after mesh integration. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that absorbable tacks may guarantee the same results as titanium tacks in terms of strength of fixation and recurrence rates. The primary end point of the present trial is to test the hypothesis that absorbable tacks are non-inferior to titanium tacks in laparoscopic incisional and ventral hernia repair (LIVHR) by lightweight polypropylene mesh, in terms of recurrence rates at 3-year follow-up. Surgical complications, post-operative stay, comfort and pain are secondary end points to be assessed. METHODS/DESIGN Two hundred and twenty patients with ventral hernia will be randomized into 2 groups: Group A (110) patients will be submitted to LIVHR by lightweight polypropylene mesh fixed by titanium tacks; Group B (110) patients will be submitted to LIVHR by lightweight polypropylene mesh fixed by absorbable tacks. DISCUSSION A few retrospective studies have reported similar results when comparing absorbable versus non-absorbable tacks in terms of intraoperative and early post-operative outcomes. These studies have the pitfalls to be retrospective evaluation of small series of patients, and the reported results still need to be validated by larger series and prospective studies. The aim of the present trial is to investigate and test the non-inferiority of absorbable versus non-absorbable tacks in terms of hernia recurrence rates, in order to assess whether the use of absorbable tacks may achieve the same results as non-absorbable tacks in mid-term and long-term settings.

The objectives of this study were to assess early risk factors for severe PJP and 90-day mortality, including the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid cytology profiles at diagnosis. METHODS: We prospectively enrolled all patients meeting pre-defined diagnostic criteria for PJP admitted at Nantes university hospital, France, from January 2012 to January 2017. Diagnostic criteria for PJP were typical clinical features with microbiological confirmation of P. jirovecii cysts by direct examination or a positive specific quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Severe PJP was defined as hypoxemic acute respiratory failure requiring high-flow nasal oxygen with at least 50% FiO(2), non-invasive ventilation, or MV. RESULTS: Of 2446 respiratory samples investigated during the study period, 514 from 430 patients were positive for P. jirovecii. Of these 430 patients, 107 met criteria for PJP and were included in the study, 53 (49.5%) patients had severe PJP, including 30 who required MV. All patients were immunocompromised with haematological malignancy ranking first (n = 37, 35%), followed by solid organ transplantation (n = 27, 25%), HIV-infection (n = 21, 20%), systemic diseases (n = 13, 12%), solid tumors (n = 12, 11%) and primary immunodeficiency (n = 6, 8%). By multivariate analysis, factors independently associated with severity were older age (OR, 3.36; 95% CI 1.4–8.5; p < 0.05), a P. jirovecii microscopy-positive result from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (OR, 1.3; 95% CI 1.54–9.3; p < 0.05); and absence of a BAL fluid alveolitis profile (OR, 3.2; 95% CI 1.27–8.8; p < 0.04). The 90-day mortality rate was 27%, increasing to 50% in the severe PJP group. Factors independently associated with 90-day mortality were worse SOFA score on day 1 (OR, 1.05; 95% CI 1.02–1.09; p < 0.001) whereas alveolitis at BAL was protective (OR, 0.79; 95% CI 0.65–0.96; p < 0.05). In the subgroup of HIV-negative patients, similar findings were obtained, then viral co-infection were independently associated with higher 90-day mortality (OR, 1.25; 95% CI 1.02–1.55; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Older age and P. jirovecii oocysts at microscopic examination of BAL were independently associated with severe PJP.

OBJECTIVES: To separate the effects of RSV LRTI and an atopic diathesis on subsequent recurrent wheezing, we examined the protective effect of previous palivizumab administration against subsequent recurrent wheeze in infants with and without a family history of atopy. METHODS: A prospective multicenter, matched, double cohort study was conducted in 27 centers in Europe and Canada. The rates of physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing in premature infants <36 weeks gestation who had received palivizumab in the first year of life were compared to those of gestational age–matched controls. RESULTS: The relative protective effect of palivizumab on physician-diagnosed recurrent wheezing through the ages of 2 to 5 years was 68% in those with no family history of asthma (odds ratio, 0.32; (95% CI, 0.14-0.75; N = 146 palivizumab-treated, 171 untreated) and 80% in those with no family history of atopy or food allergies (odds ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.07-0.59; N = 101 palivizumab-treated, 100 untreated). In contrast, there was no effect of palivizumab on subsequent recurrent wheezing in the 90 children with a family history of atopy or food allergies compared to 130 untreated infants with atopic families. CONCLUSION: Respiratory syncytial virus prophylaxis in nonatopic children decreases by 80% the relative risk of recurrent wheezing but does not have any effect in infants with an atopic family history.

DESIGN: Descriptive cross-sectional study. SETTING: Online survey conducted between April 9 and April 30, 2020, during the COVD-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: About 1,046 older adults over the age of 50 who live in North America. MEASUREMENTS: Participants were asked about their basic demographic information, current health status, and the impact of the current SDG on their subjective state of mental health. Participants completed the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, to determine the amount and intensity of physical activity performed, as well as both the Geriatric Depression Scale and Geriatric Anxiety Scale, to ascertain the extent of their depression and anxiety-like symptoms. RESULTS: Ninety-seven percent of participants indicated that they adhered to current SDG ""Most of the time"" or ""Strictly."" Participants who performed greater levels of physical activity experienced lower levels of depression-like symptoms when age, sex, and education were accounted for; however, no relationship between physical activity and anxiety-like symptoms was found. A hierarchical regression analysis that incorporated the intensity of physical activity performed (light, moderate, and vigorous) in the model indicated that greater light and strenuous activity, but not moderate, predicted lower depression-like symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that performing even light physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic may help alleviate some of the negative mental health impacts that older adults may be experiencing while isolated and adhering to SDG during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2020,"Callow, Daniel D; Arnold-Nedimala, Naomi A; Jordan, Leslie S; Pena, Gabriel S; Won, Junyeon; Woodard, John L; Smith, J Carson",Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,,#626121,,,,,220797236.0

Through both direct effects within tumor cells and promotion of tumor-stroma interactions, emmprin induces tumor cell invasiveness and regional angiogenesis. The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a common etiology for cancers arising in the setting of immune suppression, including Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma. However, whether emmprin expression and function are regulated by KSHV or other oncogenic viruses in the tumor microenvironment to promote viral cancer pathogenesis remains unknown. Fibroblasts and endothelial cells support latent KSHV infection and represent cellular components of Kaposi's sarcoma lesions. Therefore, we used primary human fibroblasts and endothelial cells to determine whether KSHV itself regulates emmprin expression, and whether KSHV-emmprin interactions mediate cell invasiveness. We found that KSHV promotes fibroblast and endothelial cell invasiveness following de novo infection through the upregulation of emmprin, and that this effect is mediated by the KSHV-encoded latency-associated nuclear antigen. We also found that emmprin promotes invasiveness, as well as colony formation, by primary effusion lymphoma cells derived from human tumors. Collectively, these data implicate KSHV activation of emmprin as an important mechanism for cancer progression and support the potential utility of targeting emmprin as a novel therapeutic approach for KSHV-associated tumors.",2010,"Qin, Zhiqiang; Dai, Lu; Slomiany, Mark G; Toole, Bryan P; Parsons, Chris",Cancer research,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.can-09-4663; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20406987/,11570413.0

Results demonstrate that males of C. maxillosus developed significantly longer than females. The sex-specific and general models for the total immature development had the same optimal temperature range and similar developmental threshold but different thermal constant K, which was the largest in the case of the male-specific model and the smallest in the case of the female-specific model. Despite these differences, validation study revealed just minimal and statistically insignificant differences in the accuracy of age estimates using sex-specific and general thermal summation models. This finding indicates that in spite of statistically significant differences in the duration of immature development between females and males of C. maxillosus, there is no increase in the accuracy of insect age estimates while using the sex-specific thermal summation models compared to the general model. Accordingly, this study does not support the use of sex-specific developmental data for the estimation of insect age in forensic entomology.

shkjb3us,,WHO,Stroke in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection: case series,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Italy is one of the most affected countries by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The responsible pathogen is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). The clinical spectrum ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe pneumonia, leading to intensive care unit admission. Evidence of cerebrovascular complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 is limited. We herein report six patients who developed acute stroke during COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A retrospective case series of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs, who developed clinical and neuroimaging evidence of acute stroke during SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Six patients were identified (5 men); median age was 69 years (range 57-82). Stroke subtypes were ischemic (4, 67%) and hemorrhagic (2, 33%). All patients but one had pre-existing vascular risk factors. One patient developed encephalopathy prior to stroke, characterized by focal seizures and behavioral abnormalities. COVID-19-related pneumonia was severe (i.e., requiring critical care support) in 5/6 cases (83%). Liver enzyme alteration and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elevation were registered in all cases. Four patients (67%) manifested acute kidney failure prior to stroke. Four patients (67%) had abnormal coagulation tests. The outcome was poor in the majority of the patients: five died (83%) and the remaining one (17%) remained severely neurologically affected (mRS: 4). CONCLUSIONS: Both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke can complicate the course of COVI-19 infection. In our series, stroke developed mostly in patients with severe pneumonia and multiorgan failure, liver enzymes and LDH were markedly increased in all cases, and the outcome was poor.",2020,"Morassi, Mauro; Bagatto, Daniele; Cobelli, Milena; D039,; Agostini, Serena; Gigli, Gian Luigi; Bnà, Claudio; Vogrig, Alberto",J Neurol,,#324327,,,,,218693551.0

The special physical requirements for divers and the potential complications associated with deep sea diving necessitate extensive investigation before certification of fitness for diving after SARS. In the early recovery period, potential problems during diving are caused by inadequate lung ventilation in relation to exercise level and increased breathing resistance attributable to weak respiratory muscles, with corresponding risk of hypoxia and hypercapnia, as well as decreased ability to respond to nonrespiratory problems during diving. Problems in the late recovery period include increased risk of diving complications (such as pulmonary barotrauma) resulting from fibrosis and scarring within the lung parenchyma, which are known complications of SARS.

Indeed, many neuropathic screening tools are primarily based on subjective descriptors to determine the presence of neuropathic pain. There is a need to systematically review and analyse the existing evidence to determine the validity of such descriptors in this cohort.Methods: Ten databases were systematically searched. The review adhered to PRISMA and CRD guidelines and included a risk of bias assessment using QUADAS-2. Studies were included if they contained symptom descriptors from a group of NLBP patients +/-leg pain. Studies had to include a reference test to identity neuropathic pain from other pain mechanisms.Results: Eight studies of 3,099 NLBP patients were included. Allodynia and numbness were found to discriminate between NLBP and nociceptive LBP in 4 studies. Autonomic dysfunction, (changes in the colour or appearance of the skin), was also found to discriminate between the groups in 2 studies. Dysesthesia identified NLBP in 5/7 respectively. Results from studies were equivocal regarding pain described as hot/burning cold and paroxysmal pain in people with NLBP.Conclusion: Subjectively reported allodynia and numbness would suggest a neuropathic pain mechanism in LBP. Dysesthesia would raise the suspicion of NLBP. More research is needed to determine if descriptors suggesting autonomic dysfunction can identify NLBP.

Although a preliminary understanding of the replication and transcription mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 has recently emerged, their regulation remains unclear. Results Based on reanalysis of public data, we propose a negative feedback model to explain the regulation of replication and transcription in—but not limited to—SARS-CoV-2. The key step leading to new discoveries was the identification of the cleavage sites of nsp15—an RNA uridylate-specific endoribonuclease, encoded by CoVs. According to this model, nsp15 regulates the synthesis of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) and genomic RNAs (gRNAs) by cleaving transcription regulatory sequences in the body. The expression level of nsp15 determines the relative proportions of sgRNAs and gRNAs, which in turn change the expression level of nps15 to reach equilibrium between the replication and transcription of CoVs. Conclusions The replication and transcription of CoVs are regulated by a negative feedback mechanism that influences the persistence of CoVs in hosts. Our findings enrich fundamental knowledge in the field of gene expression and its regulation, and provide new clues for future studies. One important clue is that nsp15 may be an important and ideal target for the development of drugs (e.g. uridine derivatives) against CoVs.",2020-08-29,"Gao, Shan; Cheng, Zhi; Jin, Xiufeng; Wang, Fang; Xuan, Yibo; Zhou, Hao; Liu, Chang; Ruan, Jishou; Duan, Guangyou; Li, Xin",bioRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e318dab40db0f2e45437716634226882b0c5a769.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.23.263327,221355851.0

Fifty-eight cytologic preps (20 oral and 38 from the nasopharynx) were obtained from ten patients and analyzed in a blinded fashion for SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope protein by immunohistochemistry and viral RNA by in situ hybridization. qRTPCR identified three positive cases and seven controls; the three cases reported mild symptoms that resolved in 2–3 days. Blinded analyses confirmed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope proteins and viral RNA in the three cases and viral absence in the seven controls. A signal for the positive cases was evident in each nasopharyngeal and none of the oral samples. Viral RNA/proteins localized exclusively to glandular cells and was present in high copy number. Blinded analysis of the cytology documented that the glandular cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 showed marked degeneration with ciliocytophthoria; viral inclusions were not evident. Co-expression analysis showed viral infected cells had increased apoptosis, marked by strong expression of activated caspase 3. Weekly serial testing of two of the cases showed persistence of productive viral infection for up to 2 weeks after symptom onset. It is concluded that the target cell of SARS-CoV-2 in the head and neck region is the glandular cell of the nasal passages, that viral infection is lytic and associated with high copy number that facilitates viral spread.

The SARS epidemic in 2003 resulted in more than 8400 SARS cases and approximately 800 deaths. Existing in non‐identified animal reservoirs, SARS‐CoV continues to represent a threat to humans although more than four years have passed since a large outbreak of SARS, and no new cases have been reported. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of reemergence of SARS. It is hence necessary to understand the biology of the SARS‐CoV to deal adequately with the next outbreak, whenever it happens. The SARS‐CoV is a novel coronavirus with a large (∼30 thousand nucleotides) positive‐sense, single‐stranded RNA containing 14 functional open reading frames (ORFs) of which 2 large ORFs constitute the replicase gene which encodes proteins required for viral RNA syntheses. The remaining 12 ORFs encode the 4 structural proteins: spike, membrane, nucleocapsid and envelope; and eight accessory proteins. The viral genome and its expression within the host cell undergoes extensive translational and enzymatic processing to form the 4 structural, 8 accessory and 16 nonstructural proteins. In an effort to understand the molecular mechanisms or capsid assembly and viral pathogenesis, laboratories around the world have adopted a variety of approaches to answering these trivial questions.

Cautery was applied to the ipsilateral pectoralis major muscle and ipsilateral temporalis muscle at bipolar, monopolar coagulation, and monopolar cut settings of 50 W. The intensity in each modality setting was increased by increments of 10 W to a maximum of 100 W. Integrity testing was performed before, during, and after each cautery setting. Voltage fluctuations were measured during cautery, and maximal voltage changes for each setting were noted. After explantation, devices were returned to the manufacturer for in-depth failure analysis to evaluate for any damage to the devices. SETTING Tertiary medical center. SUBJECTS Cadaveric study. METHODS Basic science laboratory. RESULTS No change in impedance or integrity testing occurred at any cautery setting when applied to either to pectoralis major or temporalis.

Despite its advantages, group-housing as it stands in modern industries also presents several welfare issues such as overt aggression between pen-mates and resulting stress and injuries. To date, breeding companies often largely focused their efforts on genetic selection based on individual production characteristics (e.g., litter size, piglets’ growth, and meat quality) and traditionally ignored the social behaviors and the ability to establish a dominance hierarchy without exacerbated aggression. Hence, the extent to which agonistic behavior differs according to new genetic lines is unknown. The objective of this study was to compare and investigate the influence of two genetic lines on the welfare and performance of sows housed in large semi-static groups (up to 91 animals). While the first genetic line was more aggressive toward pen-mates during gestation, the second had piglets with a lower robustness and survivability. This study raises the difficulty of finding an optimal genetic line, including both positive welfare and productivity outcomes, and points to the urgent need of considering social aspects when developing genetic lines for group-housing. ABSTRACT: Confinement of gestating sows is becoming banished in favor of group-housing in countries worldwide, forcing breeding companies to develop genetic lines adapted for social living. This study aimed at assessing the influence of two genetic lines selected for high performance (HP1, HP2, derived from Landrace × Yorkshire) on welfare and reproductive performance of sows housed in large semi-static groups (20 groups of 46–91 animals) across several parities. To address this, agonistic behaviors were recorded on d0, d2, d27, and d29 post-mixing while body lesions were scored on d1, d26, and d84. Sows’ individual and reproductive performances were also recorded. HP2 sows were more aggressive than HP1 sows since they fought (p = 0.028) and bullied (p = 0.0009) pen-mates more frequently on d0–d2. HP2 sows had more total body lesions throughout gestation than HP1 sows at higher parities (p < 0.0001). Regarding reproductive performance, HP2 sows lost less piglets (p < 0.0001) and tended to wean more piglets (p = 0.067) than HP1 sows. In conclusion, while HP2 sows were the most aggressive, HP1 sows had piglets with lower survivability, which raises ethical issues in both cases and points to the need of considering social aspects when developing genetic lines for group-housing.",2020-12-04,"Brajon, Sophie; Ahloy-Dallaire, Jamie; Devillers, Nicolas; Guay, Frédéric",Animals (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/35c523e6b51a7a35be160cce4b499612202cfb90.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7762012.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10122299; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33291805/,228079458.0

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a key role in the host cells as a receptor of Spike-I Glycoprotein of COVID-19 which causes final infection. ACE2 is highly expressed in the bladder, ileum, kidney and liver, comparing with ACE2 expression in the lung-specific pulmonary alveolar type II cells. In this study, the single-cell RNAseq data of the five tissues from different humans are curated and cell types with high expressions of ACE2 are identified. Subsequently, the protein–protein interaction networks have been established. From the network, potential biomarkers which can form functional hubs, are selected based on k-means network clustering. It is observed that angiotensin PPAR family proteins show important roles in the functional hubs. To understand the functions of the potential markers, corresponding pathways have been researched thoroughly through the pathway semantic networks. Subsequently, the pathways have been ranked according to their influence and dependency in the network using PageRank algorithm. The outcomes show some important facts in terms of infection. Firstly, renin-angiotensin system and PPAR signaling pathway can play a vital role for enhancing the infection after its intrusion through ACE2. Next, pathway networks consist of few basic metabolic and influential pathways, e.g. insulin resistance. This information corroborate the fact that diabetic patients are more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, the key regulators of the aforementioned pathways are angiontensin and PPAR family proteins. Hence, angiotensin and PPAR family proteins can be considered as possible therapeutic targets.

However, relatively few data have been reported on physical therapy interventions during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) for patients in intensive care units. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the feasibility and safety of physical therapy interventions, delivered as part of routine clinical care, for patients undergoing CRRT in an intensive care unit. METHODS Consecutive patients in the adult medical intensive care unit of one large tertiary care hospital who received physical therapy sessions while on CRRT were prospectively evaluated over 13 months. Physical therapy sessions were individualized on the basis of patients' physical impairments and activity tolerance, with patients' highest level of mobility recorded. Data on 15 different physiological abnormalities and potential safety events, including bleeding, dislodgement, or dysfunction of the CRRT catheter or circuit, were prospectively collected. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Eleven physical therapists delivered 268 rehabilitation sessions to 57 patients while they were receiving CRRT, with the following highest levels of mobility achieved during individual sessions: 78 (29%) bed exercises, 72 (27%) supine cycle ergometry, 80 (30%) sitting at edge of bed, 13 (5%) transfer to chair, and 25 (9%) standing or marching in place. No CRRT-specific safety events occurred (0%; 95% upper confidence interval, 6.3%). There were six non-CRRT-related potential safety events (2.2% of all physical therapy sessions; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-8.2%), all of which were transient changes in blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS In this prospective observational study at one adult medical intensive care unit, we found that provision of bedside physical therapy while patients underwent CRRT is feasible, and appears safe.",2016,"Toonstra, Amy L; Zanni, Jennifer M; Sperati, C John; Nelliot, Archana; Mantheiy, Earl; Skinner, Elizabeth H; Needham, Dale M",Annals of the American Thoracic Society,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.201506-359oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26788890/,207435269.0

The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of hand-sewn end-to-side esophago-gastrostomy and side-to-side stapled cervical esophagogastric anastomosis after esophagectomy for the aforementioned patients. METHODS This retrospective cohort study involved examining the medical records of 433 patients who underwent transhiatal esophagectomy for esophageal cancer from March 2010 to March 2016. All the patients were operated using end-to-side hand-sewn esophago-gastrostomy and side-to-side stapled cervical esophagogastric anastomosis. 409 of the patients received a year's worth of follow-up evaluations. All the cases were revisited in 2 weeks as well as in four, eight, and 12 months after surgery. The patients were assessed in terms of postoperative outcomes, including reflux symptoms, anastomotic leakage and stricture, and the need for anastomotic dilatation. RESULTS Hand-sewn anastomosis was carried out in 271 (62.5%) patients, whereas stapled anastomosis was performed in 162 (37.4%) patients. The mean operative times were 214.46 ± 84.33 min and 250.55 ± 43.31 min for the stapled and hand-sewn anastomosis groups, respectively (P = 0.028). The two groups showed no significant differences with respect to stays in intensive care units and hospitals. Postoperatively, 38 (14.67%) cases of anastomotic leakage were detected in the hand-sewn anastomosis group, with incidence being significantly higher than that in the stapled anastomosis group (8 cases or 5.33%; P = 0.002). Anastomotic stricture occurred less frequently in the patients who underwent stapled anastomosis (P = 0.004). Within the one-year follow-up period, the patients treated via hand-sewn anastomosis more frequently required anastomotic dilatation (P = 0.02).

This attracts attention to the possibilities of telemedicine again. In support of stopping the spread of the novel coronavirus infection, whilst keeping the healthcare system running and minimizing the risk of being infected, we also need to find new ways, methods, and platforms to deal with this pandemic. By providing a literature overview and sharing practical guidelines, including the special example of Hungarian teledentistry, we present both international and Hungarian initiatives to involve telemedicine on different levels of healthcare systems regarding COVID-19. Both international and national data show that telemedicine can play a major role in the triage process, early identification, diagnosis and treatment of infected individuals, and management of patient pathways in a way that ensures the medical team does not come into contact with potentially infected patients. It also plays an important role in remote monitoring of medical conditions and care of patients with chronic diseases and reconnects vulnerable groups of healthcare personnel to the care system. In addition to the potential benefits of telemedicine, we must not forget the limitations of this method. However, it is important to emphasize that due to its wide availability, telemedicine services can provide sufficient flexibility for both primary and specialist care (outpatient and inpatient clinical care). For that very reason, it is an urgent need to define the national professional guidelines, legal and financing possibilities in this field in a long-term sustainable way.* Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(24): 983-992. *Disclaimer: We closed the writing of this manuscript on the 30th of April, 2020.

We evaluated the anti-T. gondii effects of ursolic acid, and analyzed the production of nitric oxide (NO), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cytokines through co-cultured immune cells, as well as the expression of intracellular organelles of T. gondii. The subcellular organelles and granules of T. gondii, particularly rhoptry protein 18, microneme protein 8, and inner membrane complex sub-compartment protein 3, were markedly decreased when T. gondii was treated with ursolic acid, and their expressions were effectively inhibited. Furthermore, ursolic acid effectively increased the production of NO, ROS, interleukin (IL)-10, IL-12, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interferon-β, while reducing the expression of IL-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) in T. gondii-infected immune cells.

Preliminary studies suggest that some species alter neuronal number to scale with changes in body size. Similarly, in some species regenerates resulting from wholebody axis regeneration are smaller than their pre-amputated parent, but they maintain the correct proportionality, suggesting that tissue and neuronal scaling also occurs in regenerates. The cell dynamics and responses of neuronal subtypes during nervous system regeneration, scaling, and whole-body axis regeneration are not well understood in any system. The cnidarian sea anemone Nematostella vectensis is capable of wholebody axis regeneration, and its transparent, “simple” body plan and the availability of fluorescent reporter transgenic lines allow neuronal subtypes to be tracked in vivo in adult and regenerating animals. A number of observations suggest this anemone is able to alter its size in responses to changes in feeding. We utilized the NvLWamide-like::mCherry neuronal subtype transgenic reporter line to determine the in vivo response of neuronal subtypes during growth, degrowth, and regeneration. Results Nematostella alters its size in response to caloric intake, and the nervous system responds by altering neuronal number to scale as the animal changes in size. Neuronal numbers in both the endodermal and ectodermal nerve nets decreased as animals shrunk, increased as they grew, and the changes were reversible. Whole-body axis regeneration resulted in regenerates that were smaller than their pre-amputated size, and the regenerated nerve nets were reduced in neuronal number. Different neuronal subtypes had several distinct responses during regeneration that included consistent, no, and conditional increases in number. Conditional responses were regulated, in part, by the size of the remnant fragment and the position of the amputation site. Regenerates and adults with reduced nerve nets displayed normal behaviors, indicating that the nerve net retains functionality as it scales. Conclusion These data suggest that the Nematostella nerve net is dynamic, capable of scaling with changes in body size, and that neuronal subtypes display differential regenerative responses, which we propose may be linked to the scale state of the regenerating animals.",2020-12-01,"Havrilak, Jamie A.; Al-Shaer, Layla; Baban, Noor; Akinci, Nesli; Layden, Michael J.",bioRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/66fe0f27be349ea17c9e2ad8413941d20309bbaa.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/685917,218582569.0

We aim to evaluate its therapeutic efficacy compared to repeated surgical resection. METHODS A retrospective review was performed in 104 patients treated with curative intent for resectable recurrent colorectal liver metastases. RESULTS Sixty-one patients underwent RFA and 43 patients underwent surgery. The overall recurrence rates were 82% in the RFA group and 65.1% in the resection group (P = 0.05). The local recurrence rate on a lesion-basis was markedly higher after RFA than that after resection (16.7% versus 7.3%, P = 0.04).

We evaluated the Panbio&#8482; COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device for diagnosis of coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) in symptomatic patients (n = 412) attending primary healthcare centres. METHODS: RAD was performed immediately after sampling following the manufacturer's instructions (reading at 15 min). RT-PCRs were carried out within 24 h of specimen collection. Samples displaying discordant results were processed for culture in Vero E6 cells. Presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in cell cultures was confirmed by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Out of 412 patients, 43 (10.4%) tested positive by RT-PCR and RAD, and 358 (86.9%) tested negative by both methods; discordant results (RT-PCR+/RAD-) were obtained in 11 patients (2.7%). Overall specificity and sensitivity of rapid antigen detection (RAD) was 100% (95%CI 98.7-100%) and 79.6% (95%CI 67.0-88.8%), respectively, taking RT-PCR as the reference. Overall RAD negative predictive value for an estimated prevalence of 5% and 10% was 99% (95%CI 97.4-99.6%) and 97.9% (95%CI 95.9-98.9), respectively. SARS-CoV-2 could not be cultured from specimens yielding RT-PCR+/RAD- results (n = 11). CONCLUSION: The Panbio&#8482; COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device performed well as a POC test for early diagnosis of COVID-19 in primary healthcare centres.

By contrast, the pandemic that killed the greatest numbers in world history-the Influenza of 1918-20 - was a pandemic of compassion. No one has yet to uncover this pandemic sparking collective violence or blaming any minorities for spreading the disease anywhere in the globe.

Most remarkable, however, was the overflowing volunteerism of women, especially in the US, Canada, and Australia. To explain this widespread charitable reaction, the essay investigates the milieu of the First World War, showing how that context in domestic war settings was not conducive to risking life to aid total strangers, especially when those strangers came from different foreign countries classes, races, or religious faiths.

b7sp2dui,,WHO,Hospital reengineering against COVID-19 outbreak: 1-month experience of an Italian tertiary care center,,,,unk,"OBJECTIVE: The recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Italy has resulted in a sudden and massive flow of patients into emergency rooms, and a high number of hospitalizations with the need for respiratory isolation. Massive admission of patients to the Policlinico ""Agostino Gemelli"" Foundation of Rome, Italy, determined the need for reengineering the entire hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this article, we consider some of the structural and organizational changes that have been necessary to deal with the emergency, with particular reference to non-intensive medicine wards, and the preventive measures aimed at limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection among hospital staff and patients themselves. RESULTS: 577 staff members were subjected to molecular tests in 1-month period and 3.8% of the total were positive. 636 patients admitted to the COVID-19 pathway were included and analyzed: 45.4% were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive. More SARS-CoV-2 negative patients were discharged in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (59% vs. 41%, respectively). On the other hand, more SARS-CoV-2 positive patients were transferred to ICUs in comparison to SARS-CoV-2 negative patients (16% vs. 1%, respectively). Occurrence of death was similar between the two groups, 11% vs. 7%, for SARS-CoV-2 negative and positive patients, respectively. 25% of &#8805;80 years old SARS-CoV-2 positive patients died during the hospitalization, while death rate was lower in other age groups (5% in 70-79 years old patients and 0% in remaining age groups).

We report the outcomes of pediatric brain tumors treated with AHSCT in a quaternary referral center in Hong Kong over 10 years (June 1996–May 2006). Thirteen patients with medulloblastoma (n = 9), cerebral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (n = 1), ependymoma (n = 1), germ cell tumor (n = 1) and cerebellar rhabdoid (n = 1) were transplanted because of tumor residual (n = 1) or recurrence (n = 12).

Ferroptosis-causing radicals that are targeted by ferroptosis suppressors have not been unequivocally identified. Because certain cytochrome P450 substrate drugs can prevent lipid peroxidation via obscure mechanisms, we evaluated their antiferroptotic potential and used them to identify ferroptosis-causing radicals. METHODS Using a cell-based assay, we screened cytochrome P450 substrate compounds to identify drugs with antiferroptotic activity and investigated the underlying mechanism. To evaluate radical-scavenging activity, we used electron paramagnetic resonance-spin trapping methods and a fluorescence probe for lipid radicals, NBD-Pen, that we had developed. We then assessed the therapeutic potency of these drugs in mouse models of cisplatin-induced AKI and LPS/galactosamine-induced liver injury. RESULTS We identified various US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and hormones that have antiferroptotic properties, including rifampicin, promethazine, omeprazole, indole-3-carbinol, carvedilol, propranolol, estradiol, and thyroid hormones. The antiferroptotic drug effects were closely associated with the scavenging of lipid peroxyl radicals but not significantly related to interactions with other radicals. The elevated lipid peroxyl radical levels were associated with ferroptosis onset, and known ferroptosis suppressors, such as ferrostatin-1, also functioned as lipid peroxyl radical scavengers. The drugs exerted antiferroptotic activities in various cell types, including tubules, podocytes, and renal fibroblasts. Moreover, in mice, the drugs ameliorated AKI and liver injury, with suppression of tissue lipid peroxidation and decreased cell death. CONCLUSIONS Although elevated lipid peroxyl radical levels can trigger ferroptosis onset, some drugs that scavenge lipid peroxyl radicals can help control ferroptosis-related disorders, including AKI.",2019-11-25,"Mishima, Eikan; Sato, Emiko; Ito, Junya; Yamada, Ken-Ichi; Suzuki, Chitose; Oikawa, Yoshitsugu; Matsuhashi, Tetsuro; Kikuchi, Koichi; Toyohara, Takafumi; Suzuki, Takehiro; Ito, Sadayoshi; Nakagawa, Kiyotaka; Abe, Takaaki",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1681/asn.2019060570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31767624/,208299127.0

Today, the scientific community is investing all the resources available to find any therapy and prevention strategies to defeat COVID-19. In this context, immunonutrition can play a pivotal role in improving immune responses against viral infections. Immunonutrition has been based on the concept that malnutrition impairs immune function. Therefore, immunonutrition involves feeding enriched with various pharmaconutrients (Omega 3 Fatty Acids, Vitamin C, Arginine, Glutamine, Selenium, Zinc, Vitamin, E and Vitamin D) to modulate inflammatory responses, acquired immune response and to improve patient outcomes. In literature, significant evidences indicate that obesity, a malnutrition state, negatively impacts on immune system functionality and on host defense, impairing protection from infections. Immunonutrients can promote patient recovery by inhibiting inflammatory responses and regulating immune function. Immune system dysfunction is considered to increase the risk of viral infections, such as SARS-CoV-2, and was observed in different pathological situations. Obese patients develop severe COVID-19 sequelae, due to the high concentrations of TNF-α, MCP-1 and IL-6 produced in the meantime by visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue and by innate immunity. Moreover, leptin, released by adipose tissue, helps to increase inflammatory milieu with a dysregulation of the immune response. Additionally, gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the maturation, development and functions of both innate and adaptive immune system, as well as contributing to develop obese phenotype. The gut microbiota has been shown to affect lung health through a vital crosstalk between gut microbiota and lungs, called the “gut-lung axis”. This axis communicates through a bi-directional pathway in which endotoxins, or microbial metabolites, may affect the lung through the blood and when inflammation occurs in the lung, this in turn can affect the gut microbiota. Therefore, the modulation of gut microbiota in obese COVID-19 patients can play a key role in immunonutrition therapeutic strategy. This umbrella review seeks to answer the question of whether a nutritional approach can be used to enhance the immune system’s response to obesity in obese patients affected by COVID-19.",2020-11-07,"Di Renzo, Laura; Gualtieri, Paola; Pivari, Francesca; Soldati, Laura; Attinà, Alda; Leggeri, Claudia; Cinelli, Giulia; Tarsitano, Maria Grazia; Caparello, Giovanna; Carrano, Elena; Merra, Giuseppe; Pujia, Alberto Maria; Danieli, Roberta; De Lorenzo, Antonino",J Transl Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/95a4e879a337d4c34624a74d4e397cb56c21cd55.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7647877.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33160363/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02594-4,226274534.0
lbuj0qnv,,WHO,Symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 reinfection of a health care worker in a Belgian nosocomial outbreak despite primary neutralizing antibody response,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: It is currently unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 reinfection will remain a rare event, only occurring in individuals who fail to mount an effective immune response, or whether it will occur more frequently when humoral immunity wanes following primary infection. METHODS: A case of reinfection was observed in a Belgian nosocomial outbreak involving 3 patients and 2 health care workers. To distinguish reinfection from persistent infection and detect potential transmission clusters, whole genome sequencing was performed on nasopharyngeal swabs of all individuals including the reinfection case's first episode. IgA, IgM, and IgG and neutralizing antibody responses were quantified in serum of all individuals, and viral infectiousness was measured in the swabs of the reinfection case. RESULTS: Reinfection was confirmed in a young, immunocompetent health care worker as viral genomes derived from the first and second episode belonged to different SARS-CoV-2 clades. The symptomatic reinfection occurred after an interval of 185 days, despite the development of an effective humoral immune response following symptomatic primary infection. The second episode, however, was milder and characterized by a fast rise in serum IgG and neutralizing antibodies. Although contact tracing and virus culture remained inconclusive, the health care worker formed a transmission cluster with 3 patients and showed evidence of virus replication but not of neutralizing antibodies in her nasopharyngeal swabs.

The role of flow-diverting devices in treating ruptured aneurysms is less clear. PURPOSE To estimate rates of angiographic occlusion and good clinical outcome in patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms treated with flow-diverting devices. DATA SOURCES Systematic review of Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane databases, and EMBASE from inception to December 2015 for articles that included ruptured aneurysms treated with flow diversion. STUDY SELECTION One hundred seventy-two records were screened, of which 20 articles contained sufficient patient and outcome data for inclusion. DATA ANALYSIS Clinical and radiologic characteristics, procedural details, and outcomes were extracted from these reports. Aggregated occlusion rates and clinical outcomes were analyzed by using the Fisher exact test (statistical significance, α = .05). DATA SYNTHESIS Complete occlusion of the aneurysm was achieved in 90% of patients, and favorable clinical outcome was attained in 81%. Aneurysm size greater than 7 mm was associated with less favorable clinical outcomes (P = .027). Aneurysm size greater than 2 cm was associated with a greater risk of rerupture after treatment (P < .001). LIMITATIONS Observational studies and case reports may be affected by reporting bias. CONCLUSIONS Although not recommended as a first-line treatment, the use of flow diverters to treat ruptured intracranial aneurysms may allow high rates of angiographic occlusion and good clinical outcome in carefully selected patients. Aneurysm size contributes to treatment risk because the rerupture rate following treatment is higher for aneurysms larger than 2 cm.",2017,"Madaelil, T P; Moran, C J; Cross, D T; Kansagra, A P",AJNR.

Through an online questionnaire, we collected sociodemographic and lockdown-related information; depressive symptoms, hedonic tone, and emotion dysregulation were assessed through the Beck Depression Inventory II, the Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale, and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, respectively. In our sample (n = 500), 122 individuals (24.4%) reported depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. Individuals with and without depression differed in gender (X2 = 4.77, df = 1, p = 0.02) and age (X2 = 15.7, df = 4, p = 0.003). Among individuals presenting with depressive symptoms, those reporting close contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19 were at higher risk for severe depression (p = 0.026).

s7njob7q,,WHO,Underreporting of Death by COVID-19 in Brazil's Second Most Populous State,,,,unk,"The COVID-19 pandemic brings to light the reality of the Brazilian health system. The underreporting of COVID-19 deaths in the state of Minas Gerais (MG), where the second largest population of the country is concentrated, reveals government unpreparedness, as there is a low capacity of testing in the population, which prevents the real understanding of the general panorama of SARS-CoV-2 dissemination. The goals of this research are to analyze the causes of deaths in different Brazilian government databases (Civil Registry Transparency Portal and InfoGripe) and to assess whether there are sub-records showing an unexpected increase in the frequency of deaths from causes clinically similar to COVID-19. A descriptive and quantitative analysis of the number of deaths by COVID-19 and similar causes was performed in different databases. Our results demonstrate that different official sources had a discrepancy of 109.45% between these data referring to the same period. There was also a 758.57% increase in SARI deaths in 2020, when compared to the average of previous years. Finally, it was shown that there was an increase in the rate of pneumonia and respiratory insufficiency (RI) by 6.34 and 6.25%, respectively. In conclusion, there is an underreporting of COVID-19 deaths in MG due to the unexplained excess of deaths caused by SARI, respiratory insufficiency, and pneumonia compared to previous years.",2020,"Alves, Thiago Henrique Evangelista; de Souza, Tafarel Andrade; Silva, Samyla de Almeida; Ramos, Nayani Alves; de Oliveira, Stefan Vilges",Front Public Health,,#1004709,,,,,218856063.0

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is unique among viral RNAs in its vast potential to form RNA structures, yet as much as 97% of its 30 kilobases have not been structurally explored. Here, we apply a novel long amplicon strategy to determine the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome at single-nucleotide resolution in infected cells. Our in-depth structural analysis reveals networks of well-folded RNA structures throughout Orf1ab and reveals aspects of SARS-CoV-2 genome architecture that distinguish it from other RNA viruses. Evolutionary analysis shows that several features of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic structure are conserved across ß-coronaviruses, and we pinpoint regions of well-folded RNA structure that merit downstream functional analysis. The native, secondary structure of SARS-CoV-2 presented here is a roadmap that will facilitate focused studies on the viral life cycle, facilitate primer design, and guide the identification of RNA drug targets against COVID-19.",2021,"Huston, Nicholas C; Wan, Han; Strine, Madison S; de Cesaris Araujo Tavares, Rafael; Wilen, Craig B; Pyle, Anna Marie",Mol. cell,,#1002917,,,,,220516078.0

Recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) is an isothermal nucleic acid amplification technique, and RPA-based diagnostic assays have been described for the detection of different types of pathogens. RESULTS: The RPA assays using real-time fluorescence detection (real-time RPA) and lateral flow strip detection (LFS RPA) were developed to detect M. ovipneumoniae targeting a conserved region of the 16S rRNA gene. Real-time RPA was performed in a portable florescence scanner at 39 °C for 20 min. LFS RPA was performed in a portable metal bath incubator at 39 °C for 15 min, and the amplicons were visualized with the naked eyes within 5 min on the lateral flow strip. Both assays were highly specific for M. ovipneumoniae, as there were no cross-reactions with other microorganisms tested, especially the pathogens involved in respiratory complex and other mycoplasmas frequently identified in ruminants. The limit of detection of LFS RPA assay was 1.0 × 10(1) copies per reaction using a recombinant plasmid containing target gene as template, which is 10 times lower than the limit of detection of the real-time RPA and real-time PCR assays. The RPA assays were further validated on 111 clinical sheep nasal swab and fresh lung samples, and M. ovipneumoniae DNA was detected in 29 samples in the real-time RPA, 31 samples in the LFS RPA and 32 samples in the real-time PCR assay. Compared to real-time PCR, the real-time RPA and LFS RPA showed diagnostic specificity of 100 and 98.73%, diagnostic sensitivity of 90.63 and 93.75%, and a kappa coefficient of 0.932 and 0.934, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The developed real-time RPA and LFS RPA assays provide the attractive and promising tools for rapid, convenient and reliable detection of M. ovipneumoniae in sheep, especially in resource-limited settings. However, the effectiveness of the developed RPA assays in the detection of M. ovipneumoniae in goats needs to be further validated.",2020-06-01,"Wang, Jinfeng; Li, Ruiwen; Sun, Xiaoxia; Liu, Libing; Hao, Xuepiao; Wang, Jianchang; Yuan, Wanzhe",BMC Vet Res,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/11ea9de737ef39690df22188f4727fdd0e8b749e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7268655.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02387-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32487081/,219175693.0

We aim to quantify excess stroke-related deaths and characterize its association with social distancing behavior and COVID-19–related vascular pathology. METHODS: United States and state-level excess cerebrovascular deaths from January to May 2020 were quantified using National Center for Health Statistic data and Poisson regression models. Excess cerebrovascular deaths were analyzed as a function of time-varying stroke-related emergency medical service (EMS) calls and cumulative COVID-19 deaths using linear regression. A state-level regression analysis was performed to determine the association between excess cerebrovascular deaths and time spent in residences, measured by Google Community Mobility Reports, during the height of the pandemic after the first COVID-19 death (February 29). RESULTS: Forty states and New York City were included. Excess cerebrovascular mortality occurred nationally from the weeks ending March 28 to May 2, 2020, up to a 7.8% increase above expected levels during the week of April 18. Decreased stroke-related EMS calls were associated with excess stroke deaths one (70 deaths per 1000 fewer EMS calls [95% CI, 20–118]) and 2 weeks (85 deaths per 1000 fewer EMS calls [95% CI, 37–133]) later.

We examined whether COVID-19 risk differs according to antihypertensive drug class in patients treated by ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) compared with calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Three exclusive cohorts of prevalent ACE inhibitors, ARB and CCB users, aged 18 to 80 years, from the French National Health Insurance databases were followed from February 15, 2020 to June 7, 2020.

Previous studies have shown that PEDV ORF3 encodes an ion channel protein. However, its influence on cell cycle and subcellular structure still require more research. In this study, we developed a Vero cell line that stably expresses PEDV ORF3 gene. Subcellular localization and influences of PEDV ORF3 on host cells were investigated. We further verified whether or not this gene enhances virus production. The results showed that PEDV ORF3 protein localizes in the cytoplasm and affects cell cycle progression by prolonging the S phase. In addition, the ORF3-expressing Vero cells had more vesicles than the host Vero cells. Furthermore, the attenuated PEDV rather than virulent PEDV could grow better in ORF3-expressing Vero cells.

To identify efficacious small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to inhibit the replication of FMDV, candidate siRNAs corresponding to FMDV VP1 gene were designed and synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. In reporter assays, five siRNAs showed significant sequence-specific silencing effects on the expression of VP1-EGFP fusion protein from plasmid pVP1-EGFP-N1, which was cotransfected with siRNA into 293T cells. Furthermore, using RT-qPCR, viral titration and viability assay, we identified VP1-siRNA517, VP1-siRNA113 and VP1-siRNA519 that transiently acted as potent inhibitors of FMDV replication when BHK-21 cells were infected with FMDV. In addition, variations within multiple regions of the quasispecies of FMDV were retrospectively revealed by sequencing of FMDV genes, and a single nucleotide substitution was identified as the main factor in resistance to RNAi.

Rapid diagnostics is required for clinical decision making regarding isolation of patients and appropriate therapy. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the analytical and clinical performance characteristics of the Panther Fusion® respiratory panel using published laboratory-developed real-time PCR assays (LDT). STUDY DESIGN: Analytical sensitivity of Panther Fusion® Flu A/B/RSV was assessed by testing dilutions of cell culture isolates. Clinical performance assessment included the complete Panther Fusion® respiratory panel (Flu-A/B/RSV, PIV 1-4 and AdV/hMPV/RV) and consisted of a retrospective and a prospective study-arm. The retrospective evaluation included 201, stored (−80 °C) samples collected between February 2006 and January 2017. Prospective evaluation was performed on 1045 unselected pretreated respiratory tract samples from patients presented to our hospital between November 2017 and May 2018. RESULTS: Analytical sensitivity was generally slightly lower for the Panther Fusion® assays. Clinical specificity and sensitivity was between 96 %–100 % and 71.9 %–100 %, respectively. Discrepant results were found in 146 samples of which 88 samples tested LDT positive / Panther Fusion® negative and 58 samples were LDT negative / Panther Fusion® positive.

Such alerts are rare; however, on Feb 19, 2003, a pandemic alert was issued in response to human infections caused by an avian H5N1 influenza virus, A/Hong Kong/213/03. H5N1 had been noted once before in human beings in 1997 and killed a third (6/18) of infected people. 1,2 The 2003 variant seemed to have been transmitted directly from birds to human beings and caused fatal pneumonia in one of two infected individuals. Candidate vaccines were sought, but no avirulent viruses antigenically similar to the pathogen were available, and the isolate killed embryonated chicken eggs. Since traditional strategies of vaccine production were not viable, we sought to produce a candidate reference virus using reverse genetics. Methods We removed the polybasic aminoacids that are associated with high virulence from the haemagglutinin cleavage site of A/Hong Kong/213/03 using influenza reverse genetics techniques. A reference vaccine virus was then produced on an A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) backbone on WHO-approved Vero cells. We assessed this reference virus for pathogenicity in in-vivo and in-vitro assays. Findings A reference vaccine virus was produced in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-grade facilities in less than 4 weeks from the time of virus isolation. This virus proved to be non-pathogenic in chickens and ferrets and was shown to be stable after multiple passages in embryonated chicken eggs. Interpretation The ability to produce a candidate reference virus in such a short period of time sets a new standard for rapid response to emerging infectious disease threats and clearly shows the usefulness of reverse genetics for influenza vaccine development. The same technologies and procedures are currently being used to create reference vaccine viruses against the 2004 H5N1 viruses circulating in Asia.",2004-04-03,"Webby, RJ; Perez, DR; Coleman, JS; Guan, Y; Knight, JH; Govorkova, EA; McClain-Moss, LR; Peiris, JS; Rehg, JE; Tuomanen, EI; Webster, RG",The Lancet,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/58e5b4767a000ba416763edd6ca1c5f1fba9a42c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7112480.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15064027/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673604158923; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0140673604158923,8662261.0

Such repairs are prone to failure, particularly with low pressure venous flow (bidirectional cavopulmonary connection or Fontan). We describe our experience of disconnection of central pulmonary arteries and selective systemic-PA shunt to the hypoplastic vessel. Single ventricle patients (n=12) with diffuse left pulmonary artery (LPA) hypoplasia (LPA:RPA diameter <0.7) underwent PA disconnection (ligation clip) and selective arterial shunt to the LPA. Patients with ≤ mild atrioventricular valve regurgitation (AVVR), and no more than mild systolic dysfunction on echocardiogram were considered. Following systemic-LPA shunt, patients were re-assessed by cardiac catheterisation prior to further surgery, with follow-up catheterisation later performed and description of changes observed. Increased volume loading was well tolerated with no greater than mild AVVR and preserved systolic function (normal or mildly reduced). Selective arterial shunting increased the caliber of the LPA from 4.1 mm (1.2-5.6) to 6.5 mm (1.7-11.9) and this increase was preserved post-Fontan (6.7 mm (1.3-8.0)) (median (range)). Ventricular end diastolic pressure (EDP) increased with arterial shunting but resolved after shunt takedown and Fontan completion (median +3 and -4 mmHg respectively). Post-Fontan hospital length of stay was not prolonged (median 11 days, range 7-14). No deaths occurred. In univentricular hearts and PA hypoplasia, selective systemic-PA shunting physiologically increases the caliber of the distal vessels.

Individuals with DS have more risk of infections with respiratory complications and present signs of auto-inflammation. They also present with multiple comorbidities that are associated with poorer COVID-19 prognosis in the general population. All this might place DS individuals at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or poorer clinical outcomes. In order to get insight into the interplay between DS genes and SARS-cov2 infection and pathogenesis we identified the genes associated with the molecular pathways involved in COVID-19 and the host proteins interacting with viral proteins from SARS-CoV-2. We then analyzed the overlaps of these genes with HSA21 genes, HSA21 interactors and other genes consistently differentially expressed in DS (using public transcriptomic datasets) and created a DS-SARS-CoV-2 network. We detected COVID-19 protective and risk factors among HSA21 genes and interactors and/or DS deregulated genes that might affect the susceptibility of individuals with DS both at the infection stage and in the progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Our analysis suggests that at the infection stage DS individuals might be more susceptible to infection due to triplication of TMPRSS2, that primes the viral S protein for entry in the host cells. However, as the anti-viral interferon I signaling is also upregulated in DS, this might increase the initial anti-viral response, inhibiting viral genome release, viral replication and viral assembly. In the second pro-inflammatory immunopathogenic phase of the infection, the prognosis for DS patients might worsen due to upregulation of inflammatory genes that might favor the typical cytokine storm of COVID-19. We also detected strong downregulation of the NLRP3 gene, critical for maintenance of homeostasis against pathogenic infections, possibly leading to bacterial infection complications.",2021-01-21,"De Toma, Ilario; Dierssen, Mara",Sci Rep,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c4c65ddefa311b0aafa8faa495daef9d2d24b2d8.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7820501.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-81451-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33479353/,231679970.0

We generated rAd5 constructs expressing CD40-targeted S1 fusion protein (rAd5-S1/F/CD40L), untargeted S1 (rAd5-S1), and Green Fluorescent Protein (rAd5-GFP), and evaluated their efficacy and safety in human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 transgenic (hDPP4 Tg(+)) mice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with trial sequential analysis (TSA). RCT inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM from one of these subgroups: elderly, obese, previous atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), previous coronary-heart disease (CHD), previous heart failure (HF) or previous chronic kidney disease (CKD). RCTs describing those subgroups with at least 48 weeks were included. Outcomes: 3-point MACE; cardiovascular (CV) death; hospitalization due to HF; and renal outcomes. We performed direct meta-analysis with the number of events in the intervention and control groups in each subset, and the relative risk of events was calculated. RESULTS SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) were the only anti-hyperglycemic agents related to reduction in CV events in different populations. For obese and elderly populations, GLP-1 RA were associated with benefits in 3-point MACE; for patients with ASCVD, both SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA had benefits in 3-point MACE, while for patients with CHD, only SGLT2i were beneficial. CONCLUSIONS SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA reduced CV events in selected populations: SGLT2i led to a reduction in events in patients with previous CHD, ASCVD and HF.

Our study aims to describe the characteristics and therapeutic emergency mobile service (EMS) management of patients with vital distress due to COVID-19, their in-hospital care pathway and their in-hospital outcome. Methods: This retrospective and multicentric study was conducted in the six main centers of the French Greater East region, an area heavily impacted by the pandemic. All patients requiring EMS dispatch and who were admitted straight to the intensive care unit (ICU) were included. Clinical data from their pre-hospital and hospital management were retrieved. Results: We included a total of 103 patients (78.6% male, median age 68). In the initial stage, patients were in a critical condition (median oxygen saturation was 72% (60–80%)). In the field, 77.7% (CI 95%: 71.8–88.3%) were intubated. Almost half of our population (45.6%, CI 95%: 37.1–56.9%) had clinical Phenotype 1 (silent hypoxemia), while the remaining half presented Phenotype 2 (acute respiratory failure). In the ICU, a great number had ARDS (77.7%, CI 95% 71.8–88.3% with a PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 200). In-hospital mortality was 33% (CI 95%: 24.6–43.3%). The two phenotypes showed clinical and radiological differences (respiratory rate, OR = 0.98, p = 0.02; CT scan lesion extension >50%, OR = 0.76, p < 0.03). However, no difference was found in terms of overall in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.07, p = 0.74). Conclusion: The clinical phenotypes appear to be very distinguishable in the pre-hospital field, yet no difference was found in terms of mortality.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms, potential targets, and active ingredients of this prescription are still unknown. Therefore, it is imperative to explore the molecular mechanism of YZG. METHODS: The active compounds in YZG were screened by the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). The putative targets of YZG were collected via TCMSP and Search Tool for Interacting Chemicals (STITCH) databases. The Therapeutic Target Database (TTD) and Pharmacogenomics Knowledgebase (PharmGKB) databases were used to identify the therapeutic targets of ODUB. A protein–protein interaction (PPI) network containing both the putative targets of YZG and known therapeutic targets of ODUB was built. Furthermore, bioinformatics resources from the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID) were utilized for Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses. Finally, molecular docking was performed to verify the binding effect between the YZG screened compounds and potential therapeutic target molecules. RESULTS: The study employed a network pharmacology method, mainly containing target prediction, network construction, functional enrichment analysis, and molecular docking to systematically research the mechanisms of YZG in treating ODUB. The putative targets of YZG that treat ODUB mainly involved PTGS1, PTGS2, ALOX5, CASP3, LTA4H, F7 and F10. The functional enrichment analysis suggested that the produced therapeutic effect of YZG against ODUB is mediated by synergistical regulation of several biological pathways, including apoptosis arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, serotonergic synapse, complement and coagulation cascades and C-type lectin receptor signaling pathways. Molecular docking simulation revealed good binding affinity of the seven putative targets with the corresponding compounds. CONCLUSION: This novel and scientific network pharmacology-based study holistically elucidated the basic pharmacological effects and the underlying mechanisms of YZG in the treatment of ODUB.",2020-10-23,"Li, Jialin; Luo, Hua; Liu, Xinkui; Zhang, Jingyuan; Zhou, Wei; Guo, Siyu; Chen, Xiuping; Liu, Yingying; Jia, Shanshan; Wang, Haojia; Li, Bingbing; Cheng, Guoliang; Wu, Jiarui",Chin Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/403c31d1ac8a1cdeb241207f9f9fbe806a33481a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7584092.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13020-020-00392-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33110441/,225043898.0

The secondary objectives were to determine whether ampicillin affected respiratory score, gross consolidation, or the detection of P. multocida in lung tissue at postmortem exam (PME). Holstein bull calves (n = 39) were transported to the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine isolation facility at the mean (±SD) age of 52 ± 6 d. After a 7-d acclimation period, 30 calves were inoculated intratracheally with 1010 cfu of ampicillin-sensitive P. multocida. Lung US and respiratory scoring were performed 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post-challenge, then US once daily and respiratory scoring twice daily until d 14. Calves were randomized to receive ampicillin [n = 17, treatment (TX), 6.6 mg/kg i.m. once daily for 3 d] or placebo [n = 11, control (CON), saline, equal volume, i.m. once daily for 3 d] when ≥1 cm2 of lung consolidation was observed and ≥6 h had elapsed since challenge. Lung lesions ≥1 cm2 were considered positive for consolidation. Calves were respiratory score positive if ≥2 in 2 or more categories based on the Wisconsin respiratory health score chart. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for US score and respiratory score as a proxy for time with consolidation and clinical respiratory disease, respectively. Gross lung lesions and pathogens were quantified following PME. At the time of first treatment, consolidation had developed in 28/30 calves (TX, n = 17; CON, n = 11) and 6% (1 out of 17) of TX and 9% (1 out of 11) of CON calves had a positive respiratory score. The TX calves had a significantly lower median (interquartile range given in parentheses) AUC for US score [TX: 23 (20, 29), CON: 47 (33, 53)], whereas mean AUC for respiratory score was not different between groups (TX: 93 ± 28, CON: 96 ± 17). On d 14, 70% (12 out of 17) of TX and 100% (11 out of 11) of CON calves had lung consolidation, and 24% (4 out of 17) of TX and 27% (3 out of 11) of CON calves had clinical respiratory disease. On PME, median consolidation was 10% (6, 15) for TX and 10% (2, 28) for CON calves. Lung cultures were positive for P. multocida in 77% (13 out of 17) of TX and 91% (10 out of 11) of CON calves. Lung health benefited from a 3-d ampicillin therapy, but benefits were short-lived. Treatment failures might be due to incomplete resolution of the initial lung infection. Future studies are needed to optimize TX strategies to improve long-term lung health.",2019-12-31,"Holschbach, C. L.; Raabis, S. M.; Ollivett, T.

S localizes on the virion surface and mediates recognition of cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)4-6. Eliciting neutralizing antibodies that block S-ACE2 interaction7-9, or indirectly prevent membrane fusion10, constitute an attractive modality for vaccine-elicited protection11. However, although prototypic S-based vaccines show promise in animal models12-14, the immunogenic properties of S in humans are poorly resolved. In this study, we characterized humoral and circulating follicular helper T cell (cTFH) immunity against spike in recovered patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We found that S-specific antibodies, memory B cells and cTFH are consistently elicited after SARS-CoV-2 infection, demarking robust humoral immunity and positively associated with plasma neutralizing activity. Comparatively low frequencies of B cells or cTFH specific for the receptor binding domain of S were elicited. Notably, the phenotype of S-specific cTFH differentiated subjects with potent neutralizing responses, providing a potential biomarker of potency for S-based vaccines entering the clinic. Overall, although patients who recovered from COVID-19 displayed multiple hallmarks of effective immune recognition of S, the wide spectrum of neutralizing activity observed suggests that vaccines might require strategies to selectively target the most potent neutralizing epitopes.",2020,"Juno, Jennifer A; Tan, Hyon-Xhi; Lee, Wen Shi; Reynaldi, Arnold; Kelly, Hannah G; Wragg, Kathleen; Esterbauer, Robyn; Kent, Helen E; Batten, C Jane; Mordant, Francesca L; Gherardin, Nicholas A; Pymm, Phillip; Dietrich, Melanie H; Scott, Nichollas E; Tham, Wai-Hong; Godfrey, Dale I; Subbarao, Kanta; Davenport, Miles P; Kent, Stephen J; Wheatley, Adam K",Nat Med,,#641392,,,,,220490203.0

Acquired CD4 T cell deficiency, modeled by delaying systemic CD4 T cell depletion until MuPyV-specific CD8 T cells have infiltrated the brain, impacted the stability of CD8 bT(RM), impaired their effector response to reinfection, and rendered their maintenance dependent on circulating CD8 T cells. This dependence of CD8 bT(RM) differentiation on CD4 T cells was found to extend to encephalitis caused by vesicular stomatitis virus.

COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province of China, in early December 2019 and is now considered a pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the airborne transmission of COVID-19 and the role of face mask to prevent it. METHODS: A systematic search for English-language literature was done via PUBMED/Medline and Google Scholar up to October 2020. There was two search strategy; for airborne transmission and the role of face mask for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on a fixed and random effects model, the RR and 95% CI were used to evaluate the combined risk. This meta-analysis followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) Guidelines. RESULTS: After eligibility assessment, four articles with a total of 7688 participants were included in this meta-analysis.

Methods: Double-blind randomized trial comparing tDCS with anode over the left DLPFC (groups: rectangular electrodes, circular electrodes, sham) and 2 active subgroup references (right shoulder vs. right DLPFC cathodes). Results: Twenty-four randomized participants were assessed. We indeed found higher average EEG power spectral density (PSD) across bands for circular vs. rectangular electrodes, largely confined to F3 and there was a significant increase at AF3 for low alpha (p=0.037). Significant differences included: increased PSD in low beta (p=0.024) and theta bands (p=0.021) at F3, and in theta (p=0.036) at FC5 for the right DLPFC vs. shoulder with no coherence changes. We also found PSD differences between active vs. sham tDCS at Fz for alpha (p=0.043), delta (p=0.036), high delta (p=0.030); and at FC1 for alpha (p=0.031), with coherence differences for F3-Fz in beta (p=0.044), theta (p=0.044), delta (p=0.037) and high delta (p=0.009). Conclusion: This pilot study despite having low statistical power given its small sample size shows that active left DLPFC tDCS modulates EEG frontocentrally and suggests that electrode shapes/reference locations affect its neurophysiological effects, such as increased low alpha power at AF3 using circular vs. rectangular electrodes.

Therefore, a laboratory developed test (LDT) comprising a multiplexed RT-PCR protocol that detects and differentiates the four hCoV NL63, 229E, HKU1 and OC43 was adapted on the PF. The novel CE marked Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA and the LDT for hCoV were validated with 321 diagnostic specimens from the upper and lower respiratory tract in comparison to two SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCRs (PF E-gene RT-PCR and genesig RT-PCR, 157 specimens) or the R-GENE hCoV/hParaFlu RT-PCR (164 specimens), respectively. For the endemic hCoV, results were 96.3 % concordant with two specimens discordantly positive in the PF and four specimens discordantly positive in the R-GENE assay. All discordantly positive samples had Ct values between 33 and 39. The PF hCoV LDT identified 23 hCoV positive specimens as NL63, 15 as 229E, 15 as HKU1 and 25 as OC43. The Aptima SARS-CoV-2 TMA gave 99.4 % concordant results compared to the consensus results with a single specimen discordantly positive. Moreover, 36 samples from proficiency testing panels were detected and typed correctly by both novel methods. In conclusion, the SARS-CoV-2 TMA and the LDT for hCoV enhanced the diagnostic spectrum of the PF for all coronaviruses circulating globally for a multitude of diagnostic materials from the upper and lower respiratory tract.

METHODS: From December 2000 to November 2002 in the Section of Radiology I of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Modena, Italy), 11 patients with transplanted bowel were studied with different methods: traditional radiologic evaluation with contrast agent (all patients), evaluation of transit time with radiopaque markers (five patients), ultrasonographic (US) evaluation of the intestinal wall and Doppler US of the vascular axes (five patients), computed tomographic (CT) evaluation (all patients), and magnetic resonance (MR) evaluation of the bowel and the vascular axes (five patients). Traditional contrast examination enabled evaluation of the gastroesophageal transit and cardia functionality; anatomy and integrity of the anastomoses (proximal and distal); time of gastric emptying; morphology, tone, and kinesis of the transplanted small bowel loops and time of global transit. The study of transit with radiopaque markers was carried out in five patients to define the time of transit through the entire transplanted bowel, confirm recovery of intestinal motility, and identify possible abnormalities. The US examination was carried out in five patients to evaluate the morphology, thickness, and echo structural features of the intestinal loops. Color Doppler was performed to visualize the superior mesenteric artery and a wall arteriole of the sampled loop. CT examination was performed 2 to 4 weeks after surgery to evaluate the anatomy of the transplanted organs, arterial and venous anastomoses in case of complications identified with other methods or suspected, and periodically in the follow-up of patients who underwent transplantation due to Gardner syndrome. The protocol for MR evaluation of the bowel included coronal single-shot fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequences, axial and/or sagittal single-shot fast spin-echo T2-weighted sequences, coronal fast multiplanar spoiled gradient-echo (FMP- SPGR) sequences, coronal FMPSPGR sequences with and without administration of intravenous paramagnetic contrast agent, and axial or sagittal FMPSPGR fat-saturated sequences performed after dynamic gadolinium administration. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The study of transit with radiopaque markers was useful in patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction because it identified recovery and normalization of motility. Traditional contrast examination of the gastrointestinal tract continues to play an important role in transplanted patients because it is a simple examination that allows evaluation of the graft anatomy and recovery of motility of the residual native bowel and the transplanted loops. Moreover, it plays a crucial role in early detection of major postoperative complications such as intestinal obstruction, perforation, fistulas, and anastomotic complications (stenosis and dehiscence). CT examination is crucial for the detection of fluid collections, abscesses, and fistulas because it can serve as a guide of drainage and during follow-up of patients with Gardner syndrome can be used to investigate all possible sites in which desmoids might arise in addition to their relation to the graft. Because patients with transplanted bowel are generally rather a young population of reproductive age and because of technologic advances, MR may represent an effective method that does not use ionizing radiation and can therefore substitute for traditional radiologic evaluation. US represents a quick examination technique that is easily available and well tolerated by patients, and it has a role to play in the follow-up of transplanted patients and in the identification of major postoperative complications. However, its role in monitoring possible rejection remains to be defined with studies on wider and more representative samples.",2005-03-04,"Pecchi, A.; De Santis, M.; Torricelli, P.; Romagnoli, R.; Francesco, F. di; Cautero, N.; Pinna, A.",Abdom Imaging,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/bf4e84f5fece446085460d21fc87c1364c2b16ae.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7102087.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102087/,
