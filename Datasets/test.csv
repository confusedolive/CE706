The American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Pharmacy Special Interest Group Steering Committee aims to provide pharmacy practice management recommendations for how to transition clinical HCT or cellular therapy pharmacy services using telemedicine capabilities in the inpatient and outpatient settings to maintain an equivalent level of clinical practice while minimizing viral spread in a high-risk, immunocompromised population. In addition, the Steering Committee offers clinical management recommendations for COVID-19 in HCT and cellular therapy recipients based on the rapidly developing literature. As the therapeutic and supportive care interventions for COVID-19 expand, collaboration with clinical pharmacy providers is critical to ensure safe administration in HCT recipients. Attention to drug-drug interactions (DDIs) and toxicity, particularly QTc prolongation, warrants close cardiac monitoring and potential cessation of concomitant QTc-prolonging agents. Expanded indications for hydroxychloroquine and tocilizumab have already caused stress on the usual supply chain. Detailed prescribing algorithms, decision pathways, and specific patient population stock may be necessary. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged all members of the healthcare team, and we must continue to remain vigilant in providing pharmacy clinical services to one of the most high-risk patient populations while also remaining committed to providing compassionate and safe care for patients undergoing HCT and cellular therapies.",2020,"Mahmoudjafari, Zahra; Alexander, Maurice; Roddy, Julianna; Shaw, Ryan; Shigle, Terri Lynn; Timlin, Colleen; Culos, Katie",Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,,#32305359,,,,,215790249.0

A prospective population-based study,10.1101/2020.04.01.20049957,,,medrxiv,"Objectives. Assess how people perceive the risks of coronavirus infection, whether people take preventive measures, and which (pre-outbreak) factors contribute to the perceived risks and measures taken, such as (pre-outbreak) respiratory problems, heart problems, diabetes, anxiety and depression symptoms, loneliness, age, gender, marital status and education level. Methods. Data were collected in the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a random sample of the Dutch population. The coronavirus survey started on March 2, and the data collection ended on March 17 2020. Data were linked with surveys on health and social integration conducted at the end of 2019 (Nstudy sample=3,540). Results. About 15% perceived the risk of infection as high, and 11% the risk becoming ill when infected. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed the following. Older age-groups perceived the risk for coronavirus infection as lower (all adjusted Odd Ratios [aOR] smaller than .058). In total, 43.8% had taken preventive measures, especially females (aOR=1.47, 95% CI=1.27-1.69). Those with lower education levels less often used preventive measures (aOR=0.56, 95% CI=0.46-0.69). Those with pre-outbreak respiratory problems (aOR=2.89, 95% CI=2.24-3.73), heart problems (aOR=2.17, 95% CI=1.49-3.16) and diabetes (aOR=3.10, 95% CI=2.02-4.74) perceived the risk becoming ill when infected as higher than others. However, respondents with pre-outbreak respiratory problems and diabetes did not more often take preventive measures. Conclusions. Vulnerable patients more often recognize that they are at risk becoming ill when infected by the coronavirus, but many do not take preventive measures. Interventions to stimulate the use of preventive measures should pay additional attention to physically vulnerable patients, men and those with lower education levels.",2020-04-06,"van der Velden, Peter G.; Marchand, Miquelle; Cuelenaere, Boukje; Das, Marcel",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/686135083f06748330ae6bcd283556b00ca6925c.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049957,215782159.0

This disease should be viewed as a public health problem with a major effect on the quality of life of women as well as being a substantial economic burden. In light of the considerable progress with diagnostic imaging (for example, transvaginal ultrasound and MRI), exploratory laparoscopy should no longer be used to diagnose endometriotic lesions. Instead, diagnosis of endometriosis should be based on a structured process involving the combination of patient interviews, clinical examination and imaging. Notably, a diagnosis of endometriosis often leads to immediate surgery. Therefore, rethinking the diagnosis and management of endometriosis is warranted. Instead of assessing endometriosis on the day of the diagnosis, gynaecologists should consider the patient's 'endometriosis life'. Medical treatment is the first-line therapeutic option for patients with pelvic pain and no desire for immediate pregnancy. In women with infertility, careful consideration should be made regarding whether to provide assisted reproductive technologies prior to performing endometriosis surgery.

ACE2 protein is expressed highly in the testis. AIM The aim of this study was to compare male reproductive hormones such as total testosterone (TT), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicular stimulant hormone (FSH), and prolactin between patients with COVID-19, age-matched cases with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection, and age-matched controls. METHODS This was a prospective cohort study and included 262 men aged between 20 and 65 years. The study comprised 3 groups including patients with COVID-19 (n = 89), cases with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection (n = 30), and age-matched controls (n = 143). All cases were evaluated using TT, LH, FSH, and prolactin. Correlations between TT and clinical parameters of patient groups were investigated using Pearson's correlation test. OUTCOMES The primary outcome of the study was detection of the difference of TT, FSH, LH, and prolactin levels between the groups. Secondary outcome was to correlate TT and hospitalization time and oxygen saturation on hospital admission (SpO2) of patients. RESULTS The mean age of study groups was 49.9 ± 12.5 years, 52.7 ± 9.6 years, and 50 ± 7.8 years, respectively (P = .06). Serum TT levels was median 185.52 ng/dL in patients with COVID-19, median 288.67 ng/dL in patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection and median 332 ng/dL in control cases, (P < .0001). The proportion of patients with testosterone deficiency in group 1, group 2, and group 3 was 74.2%, 53.3%, and 37.8%, respectively (P < .0001). Serum LH levels (P = 0.0003) and serum prolactin levels (P = .0007) were higher in patients with COVID-19 and patients with non-COVID-19 respiratory tract infection than control cases. Correlation analysis revealed significant negative correlation between serum TT levels and hospitalization time of patients with COVID-19 (r = -0.45, P < .0001). In addition, a significant positive correlation was observed between SpO2 and serum TT levels in patients with COVID-19 ( r = 0.32, P = .0028). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Physicians may consider to evaluate male patients with COVID-19 for concomitant androgen deficiency. STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS Strengths include the evidence about the alteration of male reproductive hormones under COVID-19. Limitations include the analysis limited to one general hospital, only a single measurement of TT was available, free and bioavailable testosterone levels were not evaluated. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates COVID-19 is associated with decreased level of TT and increased level of LH and prolactin. More serious COVID-19 causes more reduction in TT levels and prolongs hospitalization period. M Kadihasanoglu, S Aktas, E Yardimci, et al.

Real- or near real-time monitoring of pre-diagnostic data requires automated classification of records into syndromes–syndromic surveillance–using algorithms that incorporate medical knowledge in a reliable and efficient way, while remaining comprehensible to end users. METHODS: This paper describes the application of two of machine learning (Naïve Bayes and Decision Trees) and rule-based methods to extract syndromic information from laboratory test requests submitted to a veterinary diagnostic laboratory. RESULTS: High performance (F(1)-macro = 0.9995) was achieved through the use of a rule-based syndrome classifier, based on rule induction followed by manual modification during the construction phase, which also resulted in clear interpretability of the resulting classification process. An unmodified rule induction algorithm achieved an F(1-micro) score of 0.979 though this fell to 0.677 when performance for individual classes was averaged in an unweighted manner (F(1-macro)), due to the fact that the algorithm failed to learn 3 of the 16 classes from the training set. Decision Trees showed equal interpretability to the rule-based approaches, but achieved an F(1-micro) score of 0.923 (falling to 0.311 when classes are given equal weight). A Naïve Bayes classifier learned all classes and achieved high performance (F(1-micro) = 0.994 and F(1-macro) = .955), however the classification process is not transparent to the domain experts. CONCLUSION: The use of a manually customised rule set allowed for the development of a system for classification of laboratory tests into syndromic groups with very high performance, and high interpretability by the domain experts. Further research is required to develop internal validation rules in order to establish automated methods to update model rules without user input.",2013-03-07,"Dórea, Fernanda C.; Muckle, C.

Research limitations/implications: Twitter played many positive roles, mainly through unofficial tweets. Users shared social distancing information, helped build support for social distancing, criticised government responses, expressed support for key workers, and helped each other cope with social isolation. A few popular tweets not supporting social distancing show that government messages sometimes failed.

This study analyzed the application of classic prescriptions in the diagnosis and treatment schemes based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Schemes for Coronavirus Disease at the country, provincial and municipal levels, and further explored its disrobing effect on COVID-19 disease severe phase network, and selected representative prescriptions for core target screening and gene enrichment analysis, so as to reveal its mechanism of action. Among them, 13 prescriptions were found to be used for 10 times or more, including Maxing Shigan Tang, Yinqiao San, Shengjiang San, Dayuan Drink, Xuanbai Chengqi Decoction. In addition, the COVID-19 efficacy prediction analysis platform(TCMATCOV platform) was used to calculate the network disturbances of the Chinese classic prescriptions involved. Based on the prediction results, 68 classic prescriptions were assessed on the COVID-19 disease network robustness disturbance. The average disturbance scores for the interaction confidence scores were ranked to be 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 from the highest to the lowest. There were 7 prescriptions with a score of 17 or more, and 50 prescriptions with a score of 13 or more. Among them, the top three prescriptions were Ganlu Xiaodu Dan(18.19), Lengxiao Wan(17.74), and Maxing Shigan Tang(17.62). After further mining the action targets of these three prescriptions, it was found that COVID-19 disease-specific factors Ccl2, IL10, IL6 and TNF were all the targets of three prescriptions. Through the enrichment analysis of the biological processes of the core targets, it was found that the three prescriptions may prevent the development of the disease by affecting cell-to-cell adhesion, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, and chronic inflammatory responses to COVID-19 at the severe phase. This study showed that the TCMATCOV platform could evaluate the disturbance effect of different prescriptions on the COVID-19 disease network, and predict potential effectiveness based on the robustness of drug-interfered pneumonia disease networks, so as to provide a reference for further experiments or clinical verification.",2020-07-01,"Tang, Xuan; Tong, Lin; Guo, Fei-Fei; Tang, Shi-Huan; Yang, Hong-Jun",Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20200405.401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726008/,220854780.0

We studied the effect of the pandemic on inpatients with diabetic foot problems in a level-one trauma center in Central Ohio. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients necessitating a consultation by the foot and ankle surgery service were reviewed from the first 8 months of 2020. A total of 270 patients met the inclusion criteria and divided into pre-pandemic (n = 120) and pandemic groups (n = 150). Demographics, medical history, severity of current infection, and medical or surgical management were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The odds of undergoing any level of amputation was 10.8 times higher during the pandemic versus before the pandemic. The risk of major amputations (below-the-knee or higher) likewise increased with an odds ratio of 12.5 among all patients in the foot and ankle service during the pandemic. Of the patients undergoing any amputation, the odds for receiving a major amputation was 3.1 times higher than before the pandemic. Additionally, the severity of infections increased during the pandemic and a larger proportion of the cases were classified as emergent in the pandemic group compared to the pre-pandemic group. CONCLUSIONS: The effect of the pandemic on the health-care system has had a deleterious effect on people with diabetes-related foot problems resulting in more severe infections, more emergencies, and necessitating more amputations. When an amputation was performed, the likelihood it was a major amputation also increased.Editor's Note: This Original Article accompanies ""Diabetes-Related Amputations: A Pandemic within a Pandemic,"" by Lee C.

In routine care, pediatricians often resort to clinical diagnoses, even in the absence of robust evidence‐based criteria. We used a dual approach to identify clinical characteristics that may help to differentiate infections with common pathogens including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, bocavirus‐1, coronaviruses, or parainfluenza virus: (a) systematic review and meta‐analysis of 47 clinical studies published in Medline (June 1996 to March 2017, PROSPERO registration number: CRD42017059557) comprising 49 858 individuals and (b) data‐driven analysis of an inception cohort of 6073 children with ILI (aged 0‐18 years, 56% male, December 2009 to March 2015) examined at the point of care in addition to blinded PCR testing. We determined pooled odds ratios for the literature analysis and compared these to odds ratios based on the clinical cohort dataset. This combined analysis suggested significant associations between influenza and fever or headache, as well as between respiratory syncytial virus infection and cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. Similarly, literature and cohort data agreed on significant associations between HMPV infection and cough, as well as adenovirus infection and fever. Importantly, none of the abovementioned features were unique to any particular pathogen but were also observed in association with other respiratory viruses. In summary, our “real‐world” dataset confirmed published literature trends, but no individual feature allows any particular type of viral infection to be ruled in or ruled out.

The outbreak that started from January 22, 2020, in Fujian Province has been controlled as the number of indigenous cases has not increased since March. We aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 in Fujian Province, China. METHODS: In this retrospective, multicenter study, we collected and analyzed the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory data of all cases confirmed by nucleic acid tests in five designated hospitals in Fujian Province between January 22 and February 27, 2020. All patients were followed up until discharge. COVID-19 severity was classified as mild, moderate, severe, or critical. RESULTS: Of 199 discharged patients with COVID-19, 105 patients were male, with a median age of 46.3 years, and 17 patients were severe, and 5 patients were critical on admission. Hypertension and diabetes were the most common comorbidities. The symptoms at illness onset were mainly fever (76.4%), cough (60.8%), and myalgia or fatigue (27.6%). A total of 96.5% of patients had abnormal imaging findings on chest computed tomography. Lymphopenia (37.2%) and hypoxemia (13.6%) were observed. Acute respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure occurred in 9 patients (4.5%) and 8 patients (4.0%) respectively. One patient died and the others were cured and discharged with the median hospital stay of 19 days. Old age was negatively correlated with lymphocyte count (r = - 0.296, p < 0.001) and oxygenation index (r = - 0.263, p = 0.001). Bivariate regression analysis revealed that old age (&#8805; 75 years), hypertension, diabetes, and lymphopenia were correlated with the severity of COVID-19.

However, studies have shown that Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) may play a significant role as an auxiliary treatment for COVID-19. Objective: This study aimed to assess the effects of TCM as an auxiliary treatment for COVID-19 through a systematic review of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: Four English and three Chinese language databases were searched from December 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020. RCTs comparing TCM in combination with Western medicine (WM) with the same WM therapies alone for confirmed COVID-19 patients were included. The outcome measures were cure rate, lowering of body temperature, cough relief, improvement in chest computed tomography (CT) images, deterioration of condition, and adverse effects. Methodological quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. A series of meta-analyses were conducted for selected outcomes using RevMan 5.3 software. The quality of evidence was appraised using the grading of recommendation, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) recommendations. Results: Ten RCTs with a total of 1,285 patients were included. Compared with WM alone in treating COVID-19, WM with auxiliary treatment by TCM appears to have increased the cure rate (risk ratio [RR] 1.15 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.26]), relieved cough (RR 1.32 [95% CI 1.15-1.52]), improved chest CT images (RR 1.23 [95% CI 1.11-1.37]), and reduced the number of cases transitioning from a moderate to severe condition (RR 0.58 [95% CI 0.43-0.77]). The authors are uncertain whether TCM combined WM has effects on fever normalization (RR 1.10 [95% CI 0.94-1.29]) or adverse effects (RR 0.81 (95% CI 0.42-1.57]). Although they evaluated the certainty of evidence for lowering body temperature and adverse effects as very low, and low for cure rate, certainty was evaluated as moderate for improvement in chest CT images, cough relief, and deterioration of condition. Conclusion: TCM may be an effective auxiliary treatment for COVID-19 patients, which is likely to help improve the main symptoms and reduce disease progression. However, due to the limited number of studies and apparent heterogeneity among them, a more definitive conclusion on the effect of TCM on lowering body temperature and adverse effects cannot be drawn at this time.",2020,"Zhou, Le-Peng; Wang, Jie; Xie, Ri-Hua; Pakhale, Smita; Krewski, Daniel; Cameron, D William; Wen, Shi Wu",J. altern. complement. med,,#949515,,,,,227234759.0

CoV spike (S) protein which is crucial for receptor binding, membrane fusion via conformational changes, internalization of the virus, host tissue tropism and comprises crucial targets for vaccine development, remain largely uncharacterized. Therefore, the present study has been planned to determine the sequence variation, structural and antigenic divergence of S glycoprotein which may be helpful for the management of 2019-nCoV infection. The sequences of spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were used for the comparison. The sequence variations were determined using EMBOSS Needle pairwise sequence alignment tools. The variation in glycosylation sites was predicted by NetNGlyc 1.0 and validated by N-GlyDE server. Antigenicity was predicted by NetCTL 1.2 and validated by IEDB Analysis Resource server. The structural divergence was determined by using SuperPose Version 1.0 based on cryo-EM structure of the SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein. Our data suggests that 2019-nCoV is newly spilled coronavirus into humans in China is closely related to SARS-CoV, which has only 12.8% of difference with SARS-CoV in S protein and has 83.9% similarity in minimal receptor-binding domain with SARS-CoV. Addition of a novel glycosylation sites were observed in 2019-nCoV.

In this essay, we contend that the actions of the Trump administration, and its relationships with states and local governments, can best be understood through a lens of what we refer to as “transactional federalism,” in which federalism relationships are governed by a set of exchanges between the president and states, and between states.

However, the phosphorylation of protein is significantly altered during cancer progression which triggers abnormal cellular pathways and this phosphorylation can serve as an emergent diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for cancer. Herein, we develop a nanostructured mesoporous gold electrode (NMGE)-based biosensor that enables a highly sensitive detection of protein phosphorylation with electrochemical signal amplification. The biosensor comprises nanostructured mesoporous gold electrodes whose electro-conductive framework is superior to that of the nonporous electrodes. We characterize our developed nano/mesoporous gold electrode with various electrochemical methods in the presence of the [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- redox system. We find that the mesoporous gold electrode catalyzes both the oxidation and reduction processes of the [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- system and generates a current signal that is 3 times higher than that of the nonporous gold electrode. This superior signal transduction of our nano/mesoporous gold electrode is enabled through a pore-induced (i) high electrochemically active surface area and (ii) reduced impedance with a high signal to noise ratio. The assay utilizes direct adsorption of an immunoprecipitated purified BRAF protein towards the mesoporous gold electrode and thus avoids the cumbersome sensor surface functionalization. Our developed biosensor detects the phosphorylated BRAF protein with a 2.5-fold increase in sensitivity and an ≈10-fold increase in the limit of detection (LOD) in comparison with the nonporous gold electrodes. The assay also works on a wide dynamic range from 0.5 to 20 ng μL-1 of the protein which further shows its potential for clinical application.

This qualitative study sought to understand the manifestations and consequences of stigma experienced by transgender women of color in their dating or romantic relationships. Between January and February 2019, we purposively recruited 33 transgender women of color to participate in five focus group discussions and complete a brief survey. We employed both inductive and deductive approaches to coding and thematic analysis. We identified different forms of anti-transgender interpersonal stigma experienced by transgender women of color seeking romantic relationships and by those in romantic relationships. For those dating and seeking relationships, anti-transgender interpersonal stigma took the form of dehumanizing stereotypes and sexual objectification. While these manifestations of anti-transgender interpersonal stigma persisted for some within relationships, concealment behaviors from partners was the predominant type of anti-transgender interpersonal stigma. Each of these forms of anti-transgender interpersonal stigma had significant gender-based violence consequences, specifically encountering physical violence, experiencing psychological trauma, and engaging in survival strategies. In the current climate of COVID-19, which is exacerbating risks of gender-based violence, there is an urgent need to understand and address the nuanced manifestations of stigma in relationships and their consequences on the lives of transgender women of color.

LASV entry is mediated by the viral envelope glycoprotein (GP), a class I membrane fusogen and the sole viral surface antigen. Previous studies have identified components of the LASV entry pathway, including several cellular receptors and the requirement of endosomal acidification for infection. Here, we first demonstrate that incubation at a physiological temperature and pH consistent with the late endosome is sufficient to render pseudovirions, bearing LASV GP, non-infectious. Antibody binding indicates that this loss of infectivity is due to a conformational change in GP. Finally, we developed a single-particle fluorescence assay to directly visualize individual pseudovirions undergoing LASV GP-mediated lipid mixing with a supported planar bilayer. We report that exposure to endosomal pH at a physiologic temperature is sufficient to trigger GP-mediated lipid mixing. Furthermore, while a cellular receptor is not necessary to trigger lipid mixing, the presence of lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) increases the kinetics of lipid mixing at an endosomal pH. Furthermore, we find that LAMP1 permits robust lipid mixing under less acidic conditions than in its absence.

Leadership is the ability to guide a team or organization toward a stated goal or objective. In addition to hospital-wide leadership, there is need for leadership at the level of medical teams. Resident leadership is essential to ensure team function and patient care, yet residents are often overlooked as valuable leaders. This Perspective argues that residents can demonstrate leadership during a public health crisis by creating a culture of emotional intelligence in their medical teams. Emotional intelligence has been identified as a critical aspect of leadership and consists of self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management. In psychiatry, patient interactions depend upon psychiatrists demonstrating a high level of attention to their own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors as well as those of the patient to communicate in a way that demonstrates both understanding and empathy. In this Perspective, a psychiatry resident uses expertise in emotional intelligence to recommend residents (1) be mindful, (2) ask and listen, (3) establish safety, and (4) unite around a common goal. These practical recommendations can be immediately implemented to increase emotional intelligence on medical teams to improve team function and patient care. Emotional intelligence is valuable at all levels of leadership, so hospital leadership and program directors should also heed these suggestions.

This study investigated psychological, situational, and socio-demographic predictors of COVID-19 anxiety using longitudinal data. Methods: A nationally representative sample of Finnish workers (N = 1308) was collected before and during the COVID-19 crisis. Eighty percent of the participants responded to the follow-up study (N = 1044). COVID-19 anxiety was measured with a modified Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Psychological and situational predictors included perceived loneliness, psychological distress, technostress, personality, social support received from the work community, and remote working. A number of socio-demographic factors were also investigated. Results: Perceived loneliness, psychological distress, technostress, and neuroticism were identified as robust psychological predictors of COVID-19 anxiety. Increase in psychological distress and technostress during the COVID-19 crisis predicted higher COVID-19 anxiety. A recent change in their field of work and decreased social support from work communities predicted COVID-19 anxiety. Women and young people experienced higher anxiety.

Three quarters (76.8%, 73 of 95) of hospitals had pandemic influenza plans. Only 16.4% (12 of 73) of hospitals with plans had tested them. Larger (χ2 = 6.7, P = .01) and urban hospitals (χ2 = 5.0, P = .03) were more likely to have tested their plans. 70.4% (50 of 71) Of respondents thought the pandemic influenza planning process was not adequately funded. No respondents were “very satisfied” with the completeness of their hospital's pandemic plan, and only 18.3% were “satisfied.” Conclusion Important challenges were identified in pandemic planning: one quarter of hospitals did not have a plan, few plans were tested, key players were not involved, plans were frequently incomplete, funding was inadequate, and small and rural hospitals were especially disadvantaged. If these problems are not addressed, the result may be increased morbidity and mortality when a virulent influenza pandemic hits.",2010-02-28,"Zoutman, Dick E.; Ford, B.

It is affecting the entire planet and we focus in Spain, where the first case was detected at the end of January 2020 and in recent weeks it has increased in many cases. We need predictive models in order to be efficient and take actions. The general goal of this work is present a new model of SARS-CoV-2 to predict different scenarios of accumulated cases in Spain. Material and methods: In this short report is used a model proposed previously, based on a parametric model Weibull and in a the library BDSbiost3 developed in R to infer and predict different scenarios of the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 for the accumulated cases in Spain after the spread that affects Spain detected at the end of January of this year. Results: In the analyses presented, projective curves have been generated for the evolution of accumulated cases in which they reach about 4,000 cases or about 15,000 cases, for which the lines of the day in which the value for 90 will be reached can be seen vertically 90, 95 and 99% of the asymptote (maximum number of cases, from that day they will begin to descend or remain the same), that is why the vertical lines would indicate the brake of the disease. For the worst-case scenario, it takes 118, 126 or 142 days to reach the maximum number of cases (n = 15,000) to reach 90, 95 and 99% of the asymptote (maximum number of cases), respectively. This means translated in a time scale that in the worst case the virus will not stop its progress, in Spain, until summer 2020, hopefully before. Comments and conclusions: This model could be used to plan the resources and see if the policies or means dedicated to the virus are slowing the progress of the virus or it is necessary to implement others that are more effective, and can also validate a method for future outbreaks of diseases such as these.",2020-04-14,"MONLEON-GETINO, TONI; Canela-Soler, Jaume",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/46e37af1e1b4812cf748198b969b105ae93ee50e.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20059881,215782225.0

Covid-19 was diagnosed in symptomatic patients who had a positive PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 or having typical lung lesions on imaging. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, management of immunosuppression, treatment for Covid-19, and clinical outcomes (hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, or death) were recorded. Risk factors for severe disease or death were determined. Of the 279 patients, 243 were admitted to hospital and 36 were managed at home. The median age of hospitalized patients was 61.6 years; most had comorbidities (hypertension, 90.1%; overweight, 63.8%; diabetes, 41.3%; cardiovascular disease, 36.2%). Fever, cough, dyspnea, and diarrhea were the most common symptoms on admission. Laboratory findings revealed mild inflammation frequently accompanied by lymphopenia. Immunosuppressive drugs were generally withdrawn (calcineurin inhibitors: 28.7%; antimetabolites: 70.8%). Treatment was mainly based on hydroxychloroquine (24.7%), antiviral drugs (7.8%), and tocilizumab (5.3%). Severe Covid-19 occurred in 106 patients (46%). Forty-three hospitalized patients died (30-day mortality 22.8%). Multivariable analysis identified overweight, fever, and dyspnea as independent risk factors for severe disease, whereas age over 60 years, cardiovascular disease, and dyspnea were independently associated with mortality.

The disease is characterized by severe pyrexia, oculo-nasal discharge, pneumonia, necrosis and ulceration of the mucous membrane and inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract leading to severe diarrhea. A SYBR Green I based real time RT-PCR targeting the N gene of PPRV has not been established for PPRV detection. Thus, the objective of present study was to develop highly sensitive N gene target SYBR Green I real time RT-PCR for specific detection and quantification of PPRV in clinical samples. A set of primers was designed to detect the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PPRV. RESULTS: The assay exhibited high specificity as all the viruses which have clinical and structural similarities to PPRV including Canine distemper virus (CDV), Measles virus (MV), Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) failed to show an amplification signal. The lower detection limit of the assay was 5.11 copies/μl (Ct value of 33.67 ± 0.5) and 0.001 TCID(50)/ml (Ct value of 34.7 ± 0.5) based on plasmid copy number and tissue culture infectivity titre. The assay was 3-log more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR. The coefficient of variation (CV) values for intra- and inter-assay variability were low, ranging from 0.32% - 2.31%, and 0.71% - 5.32%, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the newly developed assay, a total of 36 clinical samples suspected of PPR were screened for the presence of PPRV in parallel with conventional RT-PCR. The real time RT-PCR assay detected PPRV in 30 (83.3%) of clinical samples compared to 16 (44.4%) by conventional RT-PCR.

The present report describes a novel ITB outbreak accompanied by death among aged dogs in an animal medical center. Most inpatient dogs had received medications that could induce immunosuppression. CHV was the only pathogen identified, and several CHV isolates were recovered in cell culture. No other viral pathogens or significant bacterial pathogens were found. Molecular and serological analyses revealed that the causative CHV isolates were from a single source but that none was a peculiar strain when the strains were compared with previous CHV strains.

METHODS: One hundred ICR mice were randomly divided into the virus control, the Tamiflu control and the QZD high-, medium-, and low-dose groups. Mice were infected intranasally with influenza virus (H1N1) at 10 median lethal dose (LD(50)). QZD and Tamiflu were administered intragastrically twice daily from day 0 to day 7 after infection. The virus control group was treated with distilled water alone under the same condition. The number of surviving mice was recorded daily for 14 days after viral infection. The histological damage and viral replication and the expression of inflammatory cytokines were monitored. Additionally, the suppression capacity on the secretion of regulated on activation normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in epithelial and macrophage cell-lines were evaluated. RESULTS: Compared with the virus control group, the survival rate of the QZD groups signifificantly improved in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05), the viral titers in lung tissue was inhibited (P<0.05), and the production of inflammatory cytokines interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-6 (IL-6), TNF-α, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were suppressed (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the secretion of RANTETS and TNF-α by epithelial and macrophage cell-lines was inhibited with the treatment of QZD respectively in vitro (p<0.05) CONCLUSIONS: The preventive effects of QZD on influenza virus infection might be due to its unique cytokine inhibition mechanism.

287150,u1w328uu,,WHO,CovidSens: a vision on reliable social sensing for COVID-19,,,,unk,"With the spiraling pandemic of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), it has becoming inherently important to disseminate accurate and timely information about the disease. Due to the ubiquity of Internet connectivity and smart devices, social sensing is emerging as a dynamic AI-driven sensing paradigm to extract real-time observations from online users. In this paper, we propose CovidSens, a vision of social sensing-based risk alert systems to spontaneously obtain and analyze social data to infer the state of the COVID-19 propagation. CovidSens can actively help to keep the general public informed about the COVID-19 spread and identify risk-prone areas by inferring future propagation patterns. The CovidSens concept is motivated by three observations: (1) people have been actively sharing their state of health and experience of the COVID-19 via online social media, (2) official warning channels and news agencies are relatively slower than people reporting their observations and experiences about COVID-19 on social media, and (3) online users are frequently equipped with substantially capable mobile devices that are able to perform non-trivial on-device computation for data processing and analytics. We envision an unprecedented opportunity to leverage the posts generated by the ordinary people to build a real-time sensing and analytic system for gathering and circulating vital information of the COVID-19 propagation. Specifically, the vision of CovidSens attempts to answer the questions: How to distill reliable information about the COVID-19 with the coexistence of prevailing rumors and misinformation in the social media? How to inform the general public about the latest state of the spread timely and effectively, and alert them to remain prepared? How to leverage the computational power on the edge devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices, UAVs) to construct fully integrated edge-based social sensing platforms for rapid detection of the COVID-19 spread? In this vision paper, we discuss the roles of CovidSens and identify the potential challenges in developing reliable social sensing-based risk alert systems. We envision that approaches originating from multiple disciplines (e.g., AI, estimation theory, machine learning, constrained optimization) can be effective in addressing the challenges. Finally, we outline a few research directions for future work in CovidSens.",2020,"Rashid, Md Tahmid; Wang, Dong",Artif Intell Rev,,#597718,,,,,218684753.0

A trend towards low lymphocyte count and high neutrophil counts in patients with poor outcomes has been reported by earlier studies. We aim to synthesize existing data evaluating the relationship between clinical outcomes and abnormal neutrophil and lymphocyte counts at admission in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: An electronic search was carried out in PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) to identify eligible studies reporting frequency data on neutrophilia and lymphopenia at admission in hospitalization in COVID-19 patients. Pooled odds ratios of clinical outcomes for each parameter were calculated using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies (4,969 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. Lymphopenia at admission was found to be significantly associated with increased odd of progression to severe disease (odds ratio [OR], 4.20; 95% confidence interval [95CI%], 3.46-5.09) and death (OR, 3.71; 95%CI, 1.63-8.44). Neutrophilia at admission was also found to be significantly associated with increased odd of progression to severe disease (OR, 7.99; 95%CI, 1.77-36.14) and death (OR, 7.87; 95%CI, 1.75-35.35). Subgroup analysis revealed that COVID-19 patients with severe lymphopenia (<0.5 x10×9/L) had 12-fold increased odds of in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Admission lymphopenia and neutrophilia are associated with poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19.

Immunogenicity of vaccines is often worse in older adults as a result of immunosenescence. We have reported the immunogenicity of a novel chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, in young adults, and now describe the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in a wider range of participants, including adults aged 70 years and older. METHODS: In this report of the phase 2 component of a single-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 2/3 trial (COV002), healthy adults aged 18 years and older were enrolled at two UK clinical research facilities, in an age-escalation manner, into 18-55 years, 56-69 years, and 70 years and older immunogenicity subgroups. Participants were eligible if they did not have severe or uncontrolled medical comorbidities or a high frailty score (if aged &#8805;65 years). First, participants were recruited to a low-dose cohort, and within each age group, participants were randomly assigned to receive either intramuscular ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (2·2â×â1010 virus particles) or a control vaccine, MenACWY, using block randomisation and stratified by age and dose group and study site, using the following ratios: in the 18-55 years group, 1:1 to either two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY; in the 56-69 years group, 3:1:3:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY; and in the 70 years and older, 5:1:5:1 to one dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, one dose of MenACWY, two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, or two doses of MenACWY. Prime-booster regimens were given 28 days apart. Participants were then recruited to the standard-dose cohort (3·5-6·5â×â1010 virus particles of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) and the same randomisation procedures were followed, except the 18-55 years group was assigned in a 5:1 ratio to two doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or two doses of MenACWY. Participants and investigators, but not staff administering the vaccine, were masked to vaccine allocation. The specific objectives of this report were to assess the safety and humoral and cellular immunogenicity of a single-dose and two-dose schedule in adults older than 55 years. Humoral responses at baseline and after each vaccination until 1 year after the booster were assessed using an in-house standardised ELISA, a multiplex immunoassay, and a live severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) microneutralisation assay (MNA80). Cellular responses were assessed using an ex-vivo IFN-Î³ enzyme-linked immunospot assay. The coprimary outcomes of the trial were efficacy, as measured by the number of cases of symptomatic, virologically confirmed COVID-19, and safety, as measured by the occurrence of serious adverse events. Analyses were by group allocation in participants who received the vaccine. Here, we report the preliminary findings on safety, reactogenicity, and cellular and humoral immune responses.

FINDINGS: Between May 30 and Aug 8, 2020, 560 participants were enrolled: 160 aged 18-55 years (100 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, 60 assigned to MenACWY), 160 aged 56-69 years (120 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY), and 240 aged 70 years and older (200 assigned to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19: 40 assigned to MenACWY). Seven participants did not receive the boost dose of their assigned two-dose regimen, one participant received the incorrect vaccine, and three were excluded from immunogenicity analyses due to incorrectly labelled samples. 280 (50%) of 552 analysable participants were female. Local and systemic reactions were more common in participants given ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 than in those given the control vaccine, and similar in nature to those previously reported (injection-site pain, feeling feverish, muscle ache, headache), but were less common in older adults (aged &#8805;56 years) than younger adults. In those receiving two standard doses of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, after the prime vaccination local reactions were reported in 43 (88%) of 49 participants in the 18-55 years group, 22 (73%) of 30 in the 56-69 years group, and 30 (61%) of 49 in the 70 years and older group, and systemic reactions in 42 (86%) participants in the 18-55 years group, 23 (77%) in the 56-69 years group, and 32 (65%) in the 70 years and older group. As of Oct 26, 2020, 13 serious adverse events occurred during the study period, none of which were considered to be related to either study vaccine. In participants who received two doses of vaccine, median anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 IgG responses 28 days after the boost dose were similar across the three age cohorts (standard-dose groups: 18-55 years, 20â713 arbitrary units [AU]/mL [IQR 13â898-33â550], n=39; 56-69 years, 16â170 AU/mL [10â233-40â353], n=26; and &#8805;70 years 17â561 AU/mL [9705-37â796], n=47; p=0·68). Neutralising antibody titres after a boost dose were similar across all age groups (median MNA80 at day 42 in the standard-dose groups: 18-55 years, 193 [IQR 113-238], n=39; 56-69 years, 144 [119-347], n=20; and &#8805;70 years, 161 [73-323], n=47; p=0·40). By 14 days after the boost dose, 208 (>99%) of 209 boosted participants had neutralising antibody responses. T-cell responses peaked at day 14 after a single standard dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (18-55 years: median 1187 spot-forming cells [SFCs] per million peripheral blood mononuclear cells [IQR 841-2428], n=24; 56-69 years: 797 SFCs [383-1817], n=29; and &#8805;70 years: 977 SFCs [458-1914], n=48). INTERPRETATION: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 appears to be better tolerated in older adults than in younger adults and has similar immunogenicity across all age groups after a boost dose. Further assessment of the efficacy of this vaccine is warranted in all age groups and individuals with comorbidities.

CD8(+) T cell immunity largely correlates with enhanced survival, whereas inflammation is associated with poor prognosis. Previous studies have shown polystyrene nanoparticles (PSNPs) are biocompatible, do not induce inflammation and when used as vaccine carriers for model peptides induce CD8(+) T cell responses. Herein we test the immunogenicity of 24 different peptides, from three leading vaccine target proteins in gynecological cancers: the E7 protein of human papilloma virus (HPV); Wilms Tumor antigen 1 (WT1) and survivin (SV), in PSNP conjugate vaccines. Of relevance to vaccine development was the finding that a minimal CD8(+) T cell peptide epitope from HPV was not able to induce HLA-A2.1 specific CD8(+) T cell responses in transgenic humanized mice using conventional adjuvants such as CpG, but was nevertheless able to generate strong immunity when delivered as part of a specific longer peptide conjugated to PSNPs vaccines. Conversely, in most cases, when the minimal CD8(+) T cell epitopes were able to induce immune responses (with WT1 or SV super agonists) in CpG, they also induced responses when conjugated to PSNPs. In this case, extending the sequence around the CD8(+) T cell epitope, using the natural protein context, or engineering linker sequences proposed to enhance antigen processing, had minimal effects in enhancing or changing the cross-reactivity pattern induced by the super agonists. Nanoparticle approaches, such as PSNPs, therefore may offer an alternative vaccination strategy when conventional adjuvants are unable to elicit the desired CD8(+) T cell specificity. The findings herein also offer sequence specific insights into peptide vaccine design for nanoparticle-based vaccine carriers.",2018-12-21,"Xiang, Sue D.; Wilson, Kirsty L.; Goubier, Anne; Heyerick, Arne; Plebanski, Magdalena",Front Immunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b28a8c489742fd2227e6e4049d777febfd4051cc.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6315164.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6315164/,

AIM: To investigate the changes in sexual life and sexual function of Chinese men during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: An online questionnaire was created and the survey was administered through social media to Chinese adult men. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The main end point was the deteriorated erectile function or ejaculatory control ability, defined by self-evaluation or by decreased International Index of Erectile Function-5 items (IIEF-5) scores or increased premature ejaculation diagnostic tool (PEDT) scores. RESULTS: Altogether, 612 questionnaires were collected. About 322 (52.6%) subjects were unmarried. About 8.4% and 8.5% subjects reported deteriorated erectile function or ejaculation control ability by self-evaluation, whereas 31.9% and 17.9% subjects showed decreased IIEF-5 scores or increased PEDT scores. Subjects with deteriorated erectile function by self-evaluation and decreased IIEF-5 scores had higher General Anxiety Disorder-7 (P < .001 and P = .001) and higher Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score (P < .001 and P = .002) after the epidemic, decreased frequency of sexual life (P < .001 and P < .001) and physical exercise (P = .009 and .007) after the epidemic. Subjects with deteriorated ejaculation control ability by self-evaluation and increased PEDT scores had higher General Anxiety Disorder-7 (P < .001 and P < .001) and higher Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score (P < .001 and P = .002) after the epidemic. Subjects with decreased frequency of sexual life had reduced income (P < .001), increased anxiety (P < .001) and depression (P < .001). Married subjects had higher proportion of improved depression (P = .048) and increased frequency of sexual life (P = .010). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 epidemic, decreased sexual function was present in a certain proportion of adult men, and the risk factors include increased anxiety and depression, and decreased frequency of sexual life.

The aim of this living systematic review is to synthesise early international evidence on mortality rates and incidence of COVID-19 among people who use and provide LTC. Methods: We report the initial findings of a living systematic review (CRD42020183557), including studies identified through database searches up to 29 May 2020. We searched seven databases (MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL Plus; Web of Science; Global Health; WHO COVID-19 Research Database; medRxiv) to identify all studies reporting primary data on COVID-19 related mortality and incidence of disease among LTC users and staff. We excluded studies not focusing on LTC. Included primary studies were critically appraised and results on number of deaths and COVID-19 related mortality rates, case fatality rates, and excess deaths (co-primary outcomes), as well as incidence of disease, hospitalisations, and ICU admissions were synthesised narratively. We further included official figures on number of deaths in LTC. Findings: A total of 30 study reports for 27 unique primary studies or outbreak reports were included. Outbreak investigations in LTC facilities found COVID-19 incidence rates of between 0.0% and 71.7% among residents and between 1.5% and 64.0% among staff. Mortality rates varied from 0.0% to 9.9% of all residents at outbreak facilities, with case fatality rates between 0.0% and 33.7%. In included studies, no LTC staff members had died. LTC residents accounted for between 0% (Hong Kong) and 82% (Canada) of COVID-related deaths, according to official figures. Interpretation: Long-term care users have been particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we found wide variation in spread of disease and mortality rates between outbreaks at individual LTC facilities. Further research into the factors determining successful prevention and containment of COVID-19 outbreaks is needed to protect long-term care users and staff.",2020-06-09,"Salcher-Konrad, M.; Jhass, A.; Naci, H.; Tan, M.; El-Tawil, Y.; Comas-Herrera, A.",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/aaf1314b5d072eca662fe34f914f1fbad9b5ea6d.json,,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.09.20125237v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.09.20125237,219544870.0

This is often not true for diagnostic tests, with imperfect sensitivity and specificity. Here, we develop Lot Quality Assurance Sampling for Imperfect Tests (LQAS-IMP) to address this issue and apply it to a COVID-19 serosurveillance study in Haiti. Development: As part of the standard LQAS procedure, the user specifies allowable classification errors for the system, which is defined by a sample size and decision rule. We show that when an imperfect diagnostic test is used, the classification errors are larger than specified. We derive a modified procedure, LQAS-IMP, that accounts for the sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test to yield correct classification errors. Application: At Zanmi Lasante health facilities in Haiti, the goal was to assess the prior circulation of COVID-19 among healthcare workers (HCWs) using a limited number of antibody tests. As the COVID-19 antibody tests were known to have imperfect diagnostic accuracy, we used the LQAS-IMP procedure to define valid systems for sampling at eleven hospitals in Haiti. Conclusions: The LQAS-IMP procedure accounts for imperfect sensitivity and specificity in system design; if the accuracy of a test is known, the use of LQAS-IMP extends LQAS to applications for indicators that are based on laboratory tests, such as COVID-19 antibodies.",2020-09-13,"Fulcher, I.

Several studies have been undertaken in an attempt to minimize the impact of the disease worldwide. Although new knowledge has been quickly disseminated, including viral mechanisms, pathophysiology, and clinical findings, there is a lack of information on the effective pharmacological management of this disease. In vitro studies have shown some benefits related to the use of antimalarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2. However, the data from open clinical trials on COVID-19 patients are controversial. OBJECTIVE: We present the protocol for a research project that compares the potential protective effect of antimalarials in preventing moderate-to-severe forms of COVID-19 in two groups: (1) patients treated chronically with antimalarials for rheumatic diseases and (2) other members of the patients’ household who have not been diagnosed with rheumatic diseases and are not taking antimalarials. METHODS: This is a 24-week, prospective, observational cohort study comprising patients from public and private health services across Brazil, who chronically use antimalarials for the treatment of immune-mediated rheumatic diseases, osteoarthritis, or chikungunya-related arthropathy. A total of six sequential phone interviews were scheduled during the COVID-19 outbreak in five different regions of Brazil. Information regarding social, epidemiological, and demographic data, as well as details about rheumatic diseases, antimalarials, comorbidities, and concomitant medication, is being recorded using a specific online form in the REDCap database. Symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, including fever, cough, dyspnea, anosmia, and dysgeusia, are being self-reported and collected via phone interviews. Our main outcomes are hospitalization, need of intensive care unit, and death. RESULTS: Recruitment began at the end of March 2020, and the inclusion was done during an 8-week period (from March 29 to May 17) with a total of 10,443 individuals enrolled at baseline, 5166 of whom have rheumatic diseases, from 23 tertiary rheumatology centers across 97 Brazilian cities. Data analysis is scheduled to begin after all inclusion data have been collected. CONCLUSIONS: This study, which includes a large sample of chronic antimalarial users, will allow us to explore whether SARS-CoV-2 infection may be associated with immune-mediated rheumatic diseases and long-term antimalarial usage.

However, the mechanism behind liver injury, particularly in severe and critical COVID-19 patients, remains unclear and the clinical course is poorly described. Methods: We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study of consecutive hospitalized severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients with or without liver injury who underwent immunologic testing (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-&#945;, and IL-1ß). Liver injury was defined as peak aminotransferases &#8805;3x ULN (40 U/L) or &#8805;120 U/L. Patients with liver injury were compared to those who had normal aminotransferases throughout the hospital course. Results: 176 patients were studied; 109 with liver injury and 67 controls. Patients with liver injury were more likely to be male (71.6% vs 37.3%; p < 0.001). Peak inflammatory markers and IL-6 were higher in the liver injury group: CRP: 247 vs 168 mg/L, p < 0.001; LDH: 706 vs 421 U/L, ferritin: 2,973 vs 751 ng/mL, p < 0.001, IL-6: 121.0 vs 71.8, p < 0.001. There was no difference in the levels of IL-8, TNF-&#945;, and IL-1ß. The liver injury group had a longer length of stay and more severe COVID-19 despite having less diabetes and chronic kidney disease.

METHODS: This institutional review board-approved, retrospective study assessed all patients with diagnostic radiology examinations performed at an academic medical center with eight affiliated outpatient facilities before (January 1, 2020, to March 8, 2020) and after (June 7,2020, to July 15, 2020) COVID-19 shutdown. Examinations during the shut down (March 9, 2020, to June 6, 2020) were excluded. Patient-specific factors (eg, race, ethnicity), imaging modalities, and care settings were extracted from the Research Data Warehouse. Primary outcome was number of diagnostic radiology examinations per day compared pre- and post-COVID-19 shutdown. Univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression determined features associated with completing an examination. RESULTS: Despite resumption of nonurgent services, marked decrease in radiology examination utilization persisted in all care settings post-COVID-19 shutdown (869 examinations per day preshutdown [59,080 examinations in 68 days] versus 502 examinations per day postshutdown [19,594 examinations in 39 days]), with more significantly decreased odds ratios for having examinations in inpatient and outpatient settings versus in the emergency department. Inequities worsened, with patients from communities with high rates of poverty, unemployment, and chronic disease having significantly lower odds of undergoing radiology examinations post-COVID-19 shutdown. Patients of Asian race and Hispanic ethnicity had significantly lower odds ratios for having examinations post-COVID-19 shutdown compared with White and non-Hispanic patients, respectively.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-one patients with COVID-19 were divided into two groups: an improvement/stabilization group (n = 53) and a progression group (n = 8). Clinical data were collected to analyze and compare the differences between the two groups. RESULTS: Of the sixty-one patients, thirty-one were male (50.8%), and thirty were female (49.2%), with a median age of 53 years. On admission, significant differences were observed between the two groups with respect to the levels of Creatine Kinase (CK), lymphocytes, D-dimer and creatinine, and prothrombin time (PT). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that Platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocytes, Mean platelet volume to lymphocyte ratio (MPVLR), CK, White Blood count to mean platelet volume ratio (WMR), Lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), and serum creatinine were important factors for disease progression. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that PLR was an independent factor for disease progression in COVID-19 patients. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve revealed that the best predictor of disease progression was CK. Dynamic changes in the laboratory indicators of patients were tracked, and significant differences were found in the variation trends of white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and WMR, which gradually increased in the progression group, but gradually decreased in the improvement/stabilization group.

The dates of the surge were determined using a fitting of the two last months of reported daily new cases in 18 European countries with latitude ranging from 39° to 62°. The study proves no correlation between the country surge date and the 2 weeks preceding temperature or humidity but shows an impressive linear correlation with latitude. The country surge date corresponds to the time when its sun UV daily dose drops below &#8776; 34% of that of 0° latitude. Introducing reported seasonal blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration variation into the reported link between acute respiratory tract infection risk and 25(OH)D concentration quantitatively explains the surge dynamics. Several studies have already substantiated a 25(OH)D concentration impact on COVID-19 severity. However, by comparing different patient populations, discriminating whether a low 25(OH)D concentration is a real factor underlying COVID-19 severity or only a marker of another weakness that is the primary severity factor can be challenging. The date of the surge is an intrapopulation observation and has the benefit of being triggered only by a parameter globally affecting the population, i.e. decreases in the sun UV daily dose. The results indicate that a low 25(OH)D concentration is a contributing factor to COVID-19 severity, which, combined with previous studies, provides a convincing set of evidence.",2021,"Walrand, Stephan",Sci Rep,,#1044617,,,,,231678722.0

Studies showed that this mutation results in an open conformation of the S glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD), and increased angiotensin 1-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding and fusion, which result in an increase in SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and infectivity. Dynamic tracking of SARS-CoV-2 showed that the D614G variant became predominant after emergence in Europe and North America, but not in China. The current absence of selective pressures from antiviral treatment suggests that the driving force for viral evolution could be variations in human population genetics. Results show that ACE2 expression is higher in Asian populations than that in European, North American, and African populations. This supports the idea that lower ACE2 expression is a driving force in the positive selection for the D614G mutation. This study suggests that the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 D614G mutation during the early-to-mid pandemic is associated with enhanced transmission efficiency in populations with lower ACE2 expression.

However, the successful adoption of these combined procedures requires minimizing the unwanted torques applied to surrounding healthy structures. OBJECTIVE To define the geometry of relevant anatomical structures in endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and pineal region tumor biopsy (ETB). Second, to determine the optimal instrument shaft path required for collision-free single burr hole combined ETV/ETB. METHODS Magnetic resonance and computed tomography data from 15 pediatric patients who underwent both ETV and ETB procedures between 2006 and 2014 was segmented by using the 3DSlicer software package to create virtual 3-D patient models. Anatomical regions of interest were measured including the foramen of Monro, the massa intermedia, the floor of the third ventricle, and the tumor margin. Utilizing the MATLAB software package, virtual dexterous instruments were inserted into the models and optimal dimensions were calculated. RESULTS The diameters of the foramen of Monro, massa intermedia (anterior-posterior, superior-inferior), anterior third ventricle, and tumor margin are 6.85, 4.01, 5.05, 14.2, and 28.5 mm, respectively. The average optimal burr placement was determined to be 22.5 mm anterior to the coronal and 30 mm lateral to the sagittal sutures. Optimal flexible instrument geometries for novel instruments were calculated.

Although most cases are mild, older patients and those with co-morbidities are at increased risk of developing a cytokine storm, characterized by a systemic inflammatory response leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure. The present paper focuses on the small molecule MP1032, describes its mode of action, and gives rationale why it is a promising option for the prevention/treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm. MP1032 is a phase-pure anhydrous polymorph of 5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione sodium salt that exhibits good stability and bioavailability. The physiological action of MP1032 is based on a multi-target mechanism including localized, self-limiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activities that were demonstrated in a model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced joint inflammation. Furthermore, its immune-regulatory and PARP-1-modulating properties, coupled with antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, have been demonstrated in various cell models. Preclinical efficacy was elucidated in LPS-induced endotoxemia, a model with heightened innate immune responses that shares many similarities to COVID-19.

These are highly polymorphic peptide receptors selecting and presenting endogenously derived epitopes to circulating CTLs. The polymorphism of the MHC effectively individualizes the immune response of each member of the species. We have recently developed efficient methods to generate recombinant human MHC-I (also known as human leukocyte antigen class I, HLA-I) molecules, accompanying peptide-binding assays and predictors, and HLA tetramers for specific CTL staining and manipulation. This has enabled a complete mapping of all HLA-I specificities (“the Human MHC Project”). Here, we demonstrate that these approaches can be applied to other species. We systematically transferred domains of the frequently expressed swine MHC-I molecule, SLA-1*0401, onto a HLA-I molecule (HLA-A*11:01), thereby generating recombinant human/swine chimeric MHC-I molecules as well as the intact SLA-1*0401 molecule. Biochemical peptide-binding assays and positional scanning combinatorial peptide libraries were used to analyze the peptide-binding motifs of these molecules. A pan-specific predictor of peptide–MHC-I binding, NetMHCpan, which was originally developed to cover the binding specificities of all known HLA-I molecules, was successfully used to predict the specificities of the SLA-1*0401 molecule as well as the porcine/human chimeric MHC-I molecules. These data indicate that it is possible to extend the biochemical and bioinformatics tools of the Human MHC Project to other vertebrate species.

This in turn leads to lack of data regarding incidence and seasonality of viral RTIs which could potentially help to implement efficient strategies of antimicrobial stewardship as well as vaccine administration. Here we utilize a commercial Multiplex PCR assay for the early diagnosis of acute respiratory tract infections and discuss their epidemiology. METHODS A prospective, observational study was conducted over a period of 3 years (2017-2019). Respiratory samples received from outpatients and inpatients with suspected acute RTIs from 3 multispeciality hospitals located in the twin cities of Hyderabad-Secunderabad were subjected to FilmArray Respiratory Panel (RP) (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc.). Results were tabulated and statistically analysed. RESULTS Of 513 samples 261 (50.9%) were positive for one or more pathogens. The viruses detected included Influenza A - H1 2009(26.0%), Human Rhinovirus/Enterovirus(21.5%), Influenza A - H3N2 (17.0%), Human Metapneumovirus (9.4%), Influenza B (6.6%), Coronavirus (4.9%), Para-influenza virus (4.5%), Respiratory syncytial virus (3.1%) and Adenovirus (2.1%). The largest number of samples was positive during the monsoon season (43.8%). TInfluenza A - H1 2009 peaked in the monsoon season with another, smaller peak in February. CONCLUSIONS There is a bimodal peak of respiratory infections relative to the seasons, and vaccine administration should take place in April-May before the advent of the monsoons in this part of the country. Multiplexed PCR may be used as first line for diagnosis of viral infections so that infection control measures can be prioritized and antibiotic administration can be avoided in those who do not require it.",2020-09-29,"Anand, Mridu; Pavani, N",Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1111/tmi.13501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32996228/,222148541.0

The Netherlands recorded the highest surface irradiance since 1928, exceeding the previous extreme of 2011 by 13 %, and the diffuse fraction of the irradiance measured a record low percentage (38 %). The coinciding irradiance extreme and a reduction in anthropogenic pollution due to COVID-19 measures triggered the hypothesis that cleaner-than-usual air contributed to the record. Based on analyses of ground-based and satellite observations and experiments with a radiative transfer model, we estimate a 1.3 % (2.3 W m$^{-2}$) increase in surface irradiance with respect to the 2010-2019 mean due to a low median aerosol optical depth, and a 17.6 % (30.7 W m$^{-2}$) increase due to several exceptionally dry days and a very low cloud fraction overall.

However, these new assays need to be evaluated and validated. The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of five immunoassays (two ELISA and three CLIA assays) and one rapid immunochromatographic test for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Methods: Five semiquantitative immunoassays (MENARINI®, PALEX®, VIRCLIA®, ROCHE® and SIEMENS®) and one lateral flow rapid test (WONDFO®) were performed. A total of 124 samples were studied. Case serum samples (n=78) were obtained from COVID-19 patients confirmed by real-time RT-PCR/epidemiological-clinical-radiological criteria, and control non-SARS-CoV-2 samples (n=46) belonged to healthy healthcare workers involved in a seroprevalence study. Results: Overall, the tests showed sensitivities around 70-90% and specificities greater than 95%, including the immunochromatographic test. In addition, we observed very good agreements among them, being better for the detection of IgG than for IgM antibodies (Cohen’s kappa index of 0.95 for VIRCLIA® IgG with ROCHE®), as well as good diagnostic power of the tests as determined by the ROC curves. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the proper performance of the different immunoassays in order to be applied in the clinical practice as support in the diagnostic approach and in the development of vaccines and seroepidemiological studies of COVID-19.

261685,f7m1t46v,,WHO,Eating the unknown: Xenophagy and ER-phagy are cytoprotective defenses against pathogens,,,,unk,"Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved catabolic process devoted to the removal of unnecessary and harmful cellular components. In its general form, autophagy governs cellular lifecycle through the formation of double membrane vesicles, termed autophagosomes, that enwrap and deliver unwanted intracellular components to lysosomes. In addition to this omniscient role, forms of selective autophagy, relying on specialized receptors for cargo recognition, exert fine-tuned control over cellular homeostasis. In this regard, xenophagy plays a pivotal role in restricting the replication of intracellular pathogens, thus acting as an ancient innate defense system against infections. Recently, selective autophagy of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), more simply ER-phagy, has been uncovered as a critical mechanism governing ER network shape and function. Six ER-resident proteins have been characterized as ER-phagy receptors and their orchestrated function enables ER homeostasis and turnover overtime. Unfortunately, ER is also the preferred site for viral replication and several viruses hijack ER machinery for their needs. Thus, it is not surprising that some ER-phagy receptors can act to counteract viral replication and minimize the spread of infection throughout the organism. On the other hand, evolutionary pressure has armed pathogens with strategies to evade and subvert xenophagy and ER-phagy. Although ER-phagy biology is still in its infancy, the present review aims to summarize recent ER-phagy literature, with a special focus on its role in counteracting viral infections. Moreover, we aim to offer some hints for future targeted approaches to counteract host-pathogen interactions by modulating xenophagy and ER-phagy pathways.",2020,"Reggio, Alessio; Buonomo, Viviana; Grumati, Paolo",Exp Cell Res,,#752714,,,,,221559877.0

In this study, the marine sponge-derived natural compounds 4,6-dibromo-2-(2',4'-dibromophenoxy)phenol and 3,4,6-tribromo-2-(2',4'-dibromophenoxy)phenol were found to exhibit broad antibacterial activity against medically relevant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. The compounds were not only bactericidal against both replicating and stationary phase-persistent planktonic cells of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; they also killed biofilm-incorporated cells of both species while not affecting biofilm structural integrity. Moreover, these compounds were active against carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter sp. This simultaneous activity of compounds against different growth forms of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is rare.

The analytical results are generally represented by phylogenetic trees. NJ (neighbor joining) is a frequently used algorithm for constructing phylogenetic trees because of its few assumptions, fast operation, and high accuracy, and is based on the distance between taxa. It is known that NJ usually constructs different phylogenetic trees for the same dataset with differences in input order, which are known as “tied trees.” This article proposes an improved method of NJ, called ENJ (extended neighbor joining). The ENJ can join several (currently limited to three) nodes with the same minimum distance into a new node, rather than joining two nodes in one iteration, so it can construct triple phylogenetic trees. We have inferred the formulas for updating the distance values and calculating the branch lengths for the ENJ algorithm. We have tested the ENJ with simulated and real data. The experimental results show that, compared with other methods, the trees constructed by the ENJ have greater similarity to the initial trees, and the ENJ is much faster than the NJ algorithm. Moreover, we have constructed a phylogenetic tree for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and related coronaviruses by ENJ, which shows that COVID-19 and SARS-CoV are closer than other coronaviruses. Because it differs from the existing phylogenetic trees for those coronaviruses, we constructed a phylogenetic network for them.

Globally, extraordinary measures are being adopted to combat the formidable spread of the ongoing outbreak. Under such conditions, people's adherence to preventive measures is greatly affected by their awareness of the disease. Aim: This study was aimed to assess the level of awareness and preparedness to fight against COVID-19 among the healthcare workers (HCWs) and other residents of the South-West Saudi Arabia. Methods: A community-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted using a self-developed structured questionnaire that was randomly distributed online among HCWs and other residents (age ≥ 12 years) of South-West Saudi Arabia for feedback. The collected data were analyzed using Stata 15 statistical software. Results: Among 1,000 participants, 36.7% were HCWs, 53.9% were female, and 44.1% were aged ≥ 30 years. Majority of respondents showed awareness of COVID-19 (98.7%) as a deadly, contagious, and life-threatening disease (99.6%) that is transmitted through human-to-human contact (97.7%). They were familiar with the associated symptoms and common causes of COVID-19. Health organizations were chosen as the most reliable source of information by majority of the participants (89.6%). Hand hygiene (92.7%) and social distancing (92.3%) were the most common preventive measures taken by respondents that were followed by avoiding traveling (86.9%) to an infected area or country and wearing face masks (86.5%). Significant proportions of HCWs (P < 0.05) and more educated participants (P < 0.05) showed considerable knowledge of the disease, and all respondents displayed good preparedness for the prevention and control of COVID-19. Age, gender, and area were non-significant predictors of COVID-19 awareness. Conclusion: As the global threat of COVID-19 continues to emerge, it is critical to improve the awareness and preparedness of the targeted community members, especially the less educated ones. Educational interventions are urgently needed to reach the targeted residents beyond borders and further measures are warranted.

A total of 639 serum samples collected in the context of different studies from naturally infected cats were tested. The current study revealed that, with an apparent prevalence of 83%, FCoV serotype 1 is the most prevalent serotype in Switzerland. FCoV type 1 viruses induced higher antibody titers than FCoV type 2, and were more frequently associated with clinical signs and/or feline infectious peritonitis. The antibody development in seven cats experimentally infected with FCoV type 1 revealed that, with progressing duration of infection, antibodies to FCoV type 1 significantly increased over those to FCoV type 2. There was a significant relationship between antibody titers against TGEV, FCoV 1, and FCoV 2 and TGEV antigen detected the highest proportion of seropositive cats. We conclude that a vaccine against FCoV should be based on FCoV type 1-related antigens and that for serodiagnosis of FCoV infection TGEV should be used to attain the highest diagnostic efficiency.

Genomic studies revealed that two viral proteases, papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro), process the polyproteins encoded by the MERS-CoV genomic RNA. We previously reported that SARS-CoV PLpro acts as both deubiquitinase (DUB) and IFN antagonist, but the function of the MERS-CoV PLpro was poorly understood. In this study, we characterized MERS-CoV PLpro, which is a protease and can recognize and process the cleavage sites (CS) of nsp1-2, nsp2-3 and nsp3-4. The LXGG consensus cleavage sites in the N terminus of pp1a/1ab, which is generally essential for CoV PLpro-mediated processing, were also characterized in MERS-CoV. MERS-CoV PLpro, like human SARS-CoV PLpro and NL63-CoV PLP2, is a viral deubiquitinating enzyme. It acts on both K48- and K63-linked ubiquitination and ISG15-linked ISGylation. We confirmed that MERS-CoV PLpro acts as an IFN antagonist through blocking the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). These findings indicate that MERS-CoV PLpro acts as a viral DUB and suppresses production of IFN-β by an interfering IRF3-mediated signalling pathway, in addition to recognizing and processing the CS at the N terminus of replicase polyprotein to release the non-structural proteins. The characterization of proteolytic processing, DUB and IFN antagonist activities of MERS-CoV PLpro would reveal the interactions between MERS-CoV and its host, and be applicable to develop strategies targeting PLpro for the effective control of MERS-CoV infection.",2014,"Yang, Xingxing; Chen, Xiaojuan; Bian, Guangxing; Tu, Jian; Xing, Yaling; Wang, Yayun; Chen, Zhongbin",The Journal of general virology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.059014-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24362959/,12295069.0

With the improvement in observation networks, data assimilation of internal magma state using time-history crustal deformation data observed at the surface is expected to be suitable for solving such problems. Using finite-element methods capable of modeling complex geometry is desirable for modeling the three-dimensional heterogeneous crust structure, and nonlinear time-history analysis is required for considering the change in material properties due to the movement of magma. Thus, many cases of large-scale finite-element analysis is required, and the computational cost incurred is expected to become a bottleneck. As a basic study towards data assimilation of internal magma state considering change in material properties of the crust, we demonstrated that many case analyses of volcano deformation problems can be conducted in a reasonable time frame by development of a crustal deformation analysis method accelerated by GPUs. For verification of the data assimilation method, we estimated the magma trend in an actual three-dimensional heterogeneous crust structure without temporal change in material properties. We confirmed that the magma movement trend can be reproduced using the model considering crust heterogeneity, while models disregarding three-dimensional crust structure resulted in wrong estimations. Thus, we can see that using finite-element methods capable of modeling three-dimensional heterogeneity for crustal deformation analysis is important for accurate magma state estimation.",2020-05-22,"Murakami, Sota; Yamaguchi, Takuma; Fujita, Kohei; Ichimura, Tsuyoshi; Lalith, Maddagedara; Hori, Muneo",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/a9ac40ffa8603c12762be6e291c15d96274fbbc8.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7304054.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304054/,

We aimed to evaluate epidemiological characteristics, needs of resources, outcomes, and global burden of the disease. Methods: Systematic review was performed searching PubMed from December 1, 2019, to March 25, 2020, for full-text observational studies that described epidemiological characteristics, following MOOSE protocol. Global data were collected from the JHU-Corona Virus Resource Center, WHO-COVID-2019 situation reports, KFF.org, and Worldometers.info until March 31, 2020. The prevalence percentages were calculated. The global data were plotted in excel to calculate case fatality rate (CFR), predicted CFR, COVID-19 specific mortality rate, and doubling time for cases and deaths. CFR was predicted using Pearson correlation, regression models, and coefficient of determination. Results: From 21 studies of 2747 patients, 8.4% of patients died, 20.4% recovered, 15.4% were admitted to ICU and 14.9% required ventilation. COVID-19 was more prevalent in patients with hypertension (19.3%), smoking (11.3%), diabetes mellitus (10%), and cardiovascular diseases (7.4%). Common complications were pneumonia (82%), cardiac complications (26.4%), acute respiratory distress syndrome (15.7%), secondary infection (11.2%), and septic shock (4.3%). Though CFR and COVID-19 specific death rates are dynamic, they were consistently high for Italy, Spain, and Iran. Polynomial growth models were best fit for all countries for predicting CFR. Though many interventions have been implemented, stern measures like nationwide lockdown and school closure occurred after very high infection rates (>10cases per 100 000population) prevailed. Given the trend of government measures and decline of new cases in China and South Korea, most countries will reach the peak between April 1-20, if interventions are followed. Conclusions: A collective approach undertaken by a responsible government, wise strategy implementation and a receptive population may help contain the spread of COVID-19 outbreak.

With concerns that this vulnerable group could be at higher risk of contracting the disease or spreading it to others, the implementation of health promotion activities appropriate to this group was considered to be essential during the epidemic. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of delivering a telephone health education programme dealing with anxiety levels, and knowledge and practice of measures to prevent transmission of SARS among a group of older adults with low SES. Design Pretest/posttest design. Settings Subjects were recruited from registered members of a government subsidized social service center in Hong Kong and living in low-cost housing estates. Participants The eligibility criteria were: (1) aged 55 or above; (2) able to speak Cantonese; (3) no hearing impairment, and (4) reachable by telephone. Of the 295 eligible subjects, 122 older adults completed the whole study. Methods The interviewers approached all eligible subjects by telephone during the period of 15–25 May 2003. After obtaining the participants’ verbal consent, the interviewer collected baseline data by use of a questionnaire and implemented a health education programme. A follow-up telephone call was made a week later using the same questionnaire. Results The level of anxiety was lowered (t=3.28, p<0.001), and knowledge regarding the transmission routes of droplets (p<0.001) and urine and feaces (p<0.01) were improved after the intervention. Although statistical significant difference was found in the practice of identified preventive measures before and after intervention, influence on behavioral changes needed further exploration. Conclusion The telephone health education seemed to be effective in relieving anxiety and improving knowledge of the main transmission routes of SARS in this group, but not the practice of preventing SARS. Telephone contact appears to be a practical way of providing health education to vulnerable groups when face-to-face measure is not feasible and may be useful in raising health awareness during future outbreaks of emerging infections.",2007-09-30,"Chan, Sophia S.C.; So, Winnie K.W.; Wong, David C.N.; Lee, Angel C.K.; Tiwari, Agnes",International Journal of Nursing Studies,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/720937e57c7f2604c9ab4c653dafe12b73e9f63f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094290.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0020748906001313; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020748906001313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16857203/,9908403.0

The amount of aortic wall calcification (AWC) can be estimated on low-dose chest CT. We suggest quantification of AWC on the low-dose chest CT, which is initially performed for the diagnosis of COVID-19, to screen for patients at risk of severe COVID-19. METHODS: Seventy consecutive patients (46 in center 1, 24 in center 2) with parallel low-dose chest CT and positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 were included in our multi-center, multi-vendor study. The outcome was rated moderate (no hospitalization, hospitalization) and severe (ICU, tracheal intubation, death), the latter implying a requirement for intensive care treatment. The amount of AWC was quantified with the CT vendor's software. RESULTS: Of 70 included patients, 38 developed a moderate, and 32 a severe COVID-19. The average volume of AWC was significantly higher throughout the subgroup with severe COVID-19, when compared to moderate cases (771.7 mm(3) (Q1 = 49.8 mm(3), Q3 = 3065.5 mm(3)) vs. 0 mm(3) (Q1 = 0 mm(3), Q3 = 57.3 mm(3))). Within multivariate regression analysis, including AWC, patient age and sex, as well as a cardiovascular comorbidity score, the volume of AWC was the only significant regressor for severe COVID-19 (p = 0.004). For AWC > 3000 mm(3), the logistic regression predicts risk for a severe progression of 0.78. If there are no visually detectable AWC risk for severe progression is 0.13, only. CONCLUSION: AWC seems to be an independent biomarker for the prediction of severe progression and intensive care treatment of COVID-19 already at the time of patient admission to the hospital; verification in a larger multi-center, multi-vendor study is desired.",2020-12-23,"Fervers, Philipp; Kottlors, Jonathan; Zopfs, David; Bremm, Johannes; Maintz, David; Safarov, Orkhan; Tritt, Stephanie; Abdullayev, Nuran; Persigehl, Thorsten",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/f0a2ed64057aacd1a83e2fed8bfa61eaa81ac7a8.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7757863.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33362199/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0244267,229696477.0

Design/methodology/approach: An exploratory pedagogic research design was implemented in 2020 to examine the COVID-19 Dyadic Online Mentoring Intervention, a four-month individualized approach to mentorship. A survey was completed by mentees in an educational leadership cohort that revealed the benefits and drawbacks of technology for learning within online doctoral mentoring contexts. Additional sources of data were published literature, mentor's notes, email exchanges, and scholarly enrichment products. Findings: Data analysis yielded three themes: (1) mentoring strategies were utilized; (2) the pandemic unsettled reality and (3) personal professional development opportunities were evident. Although life challenges were exacerbated by the pandemic, the online doctoral mentoring intervention met dissertation-related needs and supported academic progress in a Doctorate in Education degree program. Practical implications: Technology-mediated mentoring during crises involves more than modality changes. Faculty mentors should not be solely responsible for mitigating program and dissertation disruption. Academic cultures must support the adoption of pedagogic innovations like high-quality online doctoral mentoring.

METHODS A network pharmacology-based method was utilized. First candidate compounds, targets of GX II were collected using PharmMapper, BATMAN-TCM, DrugBank and SwissTargetPrediction, and targets on CHD were mined from GeneCards, DisGenet, DrugBank and GEO. Afterwards, the big hub compounds and targets were chosen in the candidate compounds-direct therapeutic targets on the CHD (C-T) network and the direct therapeutic targets on the CHD (T-D) network. Furthermore, the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis were performed to identify the enriched terms. Finally, a molecular docking simulation strategy was adopted to verify the binding capacity between the big hub compounds and big hub targets on CHD. RESULTS First, 114 candidate compounds were selected with the following criteria: OB⩾30%, DL⩾0.18, and HL ⩾4 h. Then, 1,035 targets of GX II were gathered, while 928 targets on CHD were collected. Afterwards, 196 common targets of compound targets and therapeutic targets on CHD were defined as direct therapeutic targets acting on CHD. In addition, the contribution index (CI) in the C-T network was calculated, and 4 centrality properties, including degree, betweenness, closeness and coreness, in the T-D network, 4 big hub compounds, and 6 big hub targets were eventually chosen. Furthermore, the GO and KEGG analysis indicated that GX II acted on CHD by regulating the reactive oxygen species metabolism, steroid metabolism, lipid metabolism, inflammatory response, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. The docking results manifested excellent binding capacity between the 4 big hub compounds and 6 big hub targets on CHD.

Oxygen delivery systems include low-flow and high-flow devices. In high-flow devices such as the Venturi mask, a constant mixture of oxygen is delivered. As a result, increased rate of breathing does not affect the concentration of oxygen delivered. In this study, we compared the efficacy of oxygen masks and Venturi masks in the management of hypoxemia in pediatric patients. METHODS A total of 65 children, aged 3-36 months, diagnosed with HALRI, were enrolled. Patients were allocated into groups, via simple alternate randomization, to receive oxygen through an oxygen mask or through a Venturi mask. Respiratory rate, heart rate, retraction, blood gas parameters, oxygen saturation, length of hospitalization, and oxygenation were recorded before and after oxygen treatment. RESULTS After 24 h of treatment, respiratory rate was significantly lower among patients in the Venturi mask group compared with the oxygen mask group. Duration of supplemental oxygen and length of hospitalization were significantly lower in the Venturi mask group compared with the oxygen mask group. CONCLUSION In both groups, there was marked improvement in all measured parameters following introduction of supplemental oxygen. Oxygen was delivered more efficiently, however, by high-flow systems.

A partial lockdown aimed to mitigate the advance of the virus by raising the social isolation rates, by limiting the operation of several services and the mobility of the population. Thus, this study aims to analyze the relationship between the social isolation index in the city of São Paulo and the emission levels of the main air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NOx, NO, NO2, SO2 and CO), as well as air temperature. We analyzed the data collected from three urban air quality monitoring stations located in the city center of São Paulo from March 16, 2020 to July 20, 2020. The data for 2020 were compared with those of the previous period in 2020 and the same period in the previous 5 years (2015-2019), and also to the city's official indices of social isolation. The relationships between pollutant concentrations and the social isolation index showed that the decrease in mobility influenced the reduction in air pollution. Pollutants NO2, NOx, NO and CO had the strongest negative associations (Pearson's correlation = - 0.582; 0.481; - 0.433 and - 0.367, respectively). Our results showed that the partial lockdown (from March 17, 2020, to July 20, 2020) had a positive impact on air quality, with a reduction in the emission of pollutants NO (31.75%), NO2 (20.60%), NOx (27.21%) and CO (29.95%). The greatest reductions in the emission of pollutants were observed when the social isolation index reached an average of 52.20%.

A major driver of these gene expression changes is a virally encoded, messenger RNA (mRNA)-specific endonuclease termed SOX. SOX cleaves the majority of cytoplasmic mRNAs, but does so at specific internal sites loosely defined by a degenerate sequence motif. If and how RNA sequence directs SOX targeting remained unknown. To address these questions, we used recombinant, highly purified SOX endonuclease in a series of biochemical assays to reconstitute the cleavage reaction in vitro and gain significant insight into the biochemical mechanism of both SOX target recognition and endonucleolytic cleavage. Using this system, we determined that cut site specificity is preserved with purified SOX and a validated target RNA and thus does not require additional cellular cofactors. Furthermore, we showed that SOX displays robust, sequence-specific RNA binding to residues proximal to the cleavage site, which must be presented in a particular structural context. The strength of SOX binding dictates cleavage efficiency, providing an explanation for the breadth of target RNA susceptibility observed in cells. Significance Statement Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic human virus that causes Kaposi’s sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and multicentric Castleman disease. During viral replication, KSHV expresses an enzyme called SOX that cuts and inactivates the majority of cellular messenger RNAs, preventing their translation into proteins. Some mRNAs are efficiently cleaved by SOX, while others are poorly cleaved, but the mechanistic basis underlying this selectivity has remained largely unknown. Here, we reveal that the efficiency of RNA cleavage is heavily impacted by RNA sequences proximal to the cleavage site, which serve as a SOX binding platform. This helps explain both the range of RNA cleavage efficiency observed in SOX-expressing cells as well as the sequence specificity underlying SOX targeting.",2018-05-13,"Mendez, Aaron S.; Vogt, Carolin; Bohne, Jens; Glaunsinger, Britt A.",bioRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/532dc582abd41e833303742ca40976db63fe6fc1.json; document_parses/pdf_json/69a264b6ce4df3496146dfd0add9ffc47615605c.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/320929,196632439.0

Corrected minute ventilation (VÌEcorr ) is a simple surrogate of dead space, but, despite its increasing use, its association with mortality has not been proven. The aim of our study was to assess the association between VÌEcorr and hospital mortality. We also compared the strength of this association with that of estimated VD/VT and ventilatory ratio. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study with prospectively collected data. We evaluated 187 consecutive mechanically ventilated subjects with ARDS caused by novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The association between VÌEcorr and hospital mortality was assessed in multivariable logistic models. The same was done for estimated VD/VT and ventilatory ratio. RESULTS: Mean ± SD VÌEcorr was 11.8 ± 3.3 L/min in survivors and 14.5 ± 3.9 L/min in nonsurvivors (P < .001) and was independently associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.15, P = .01). The strength of association of VÌEcorr with mortality was similar to that of VD/VT and ventilatory ratio. CONCLUSIONS: VÌEcorr was independently associated with hospital mortality in subjects with ARDS caused by COVID-19.

METHODS: This cross-sectional survey was carried out based on phone interviews of 1073 adults aged over 18 years from 4 to 12 April 2020 in Mashhad, Khorasan-Razavi Province, as the second largest city of Iran. A systematic random sampling was carried out using fixed phone number lists provided by Telecommunication Company of Khorasan-Razavi Province. Phone interviews were carried out by trained interviewers from the Iranian Students Polling Agency (ISPA) at various times of the day. The survey included sociodemographic questions, perceived social support scale (MSPSS) and questions about self-isolation during the Nowruz holiday. Statistical analysis included Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney test and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: 20.5% of participants reported poor compliance with stay at home orders during the first 2 weeks of Nowruz. Clear social gradients were not found in stay-at-home compliance. When controlling socio-demographic factors, perceived social support, interestingly, both fostered and hindered people’s compliance with stay at home orders, depending on the source of support from family members (OR = .874, 95% CI = .803, .950, p < .005), friends (OR = 1.147, 95% CI = 1.076, 1.222, p < .001) and a significant other person (OR = .926, 95% CI = .849, 1.010, p = .084).

Due to the current global emergency and the length of time required to develop specific antiviral agent(s) and a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the world health organization (WHO) adopted the strategy of repurposing existing medications to treat COVID-19. Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) were previously approved by the US food and drug administration (FDA) for anemia treatment and studies have also demonstrated its antiviral activity in vitro. Therefore, we performed a docking study to explore the interaction of IONPs (Fe2O3 and Fe3O4) with the spike protein receptor binding domain (S1-RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 that is required for virus attachment to the host cell receptors. A similar docking analysis was also performed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) glycoproteins E1 and E2. These studies revealed that both Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 interacted efficiently with the SARS-CoV-2 S1-RBD and to HCV glycoproteins, E1 and E2. Fe3O4 formed a more stable complex with S1-RBD whereas Fe2O3 favored HCV E1 and E2. These interactions of IONPs are expected to be associated with viral proteins conformational changes and hence, viral inactivation. Therefore, we recommend FDA-approved-IONPs to proceed for COVID-19 treatment clinical trials.",2020,"Abo-Zeid, Yasmin; Ismail, Nasser S M; McLean, Gary R; Hamdy, Nadia M",Eur J Pharm Sci,,#639701,,,,,220487487.0

While there have been a number of studies of youth self-harm in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), there is currently no systematic review of studies of prevalence rates and risk and protective factors. AIM To systematically review the evidence relating to the prevalence rates and forms of self-harm in youth in LMICs and its relationship to family economic status, family functioning, relationship with the peer group, social relationships and academic performance. METHODS Electronic searches of three databases, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Scopus, were performed. In total, 27 school-, community- and hospital-based studies evaluating self-harm in LMICs with youth focus (with participants between 12 and 25 years) were included. RESULTS The self-harm was divided into suicidal and non-suicidal depending on the nature of self-harm. The 12-month prevalence rates of non-suicidal self-harm varied from 15.5% to 31.3%, and the range of suicidal behaviour rates was from 3.2% to 4.7%. Banging and hitting were the most common in the community-based studies, followed by cutting, scratching and wound picking. Self-poisoning with pesticides was most commonly reported in hospital-based studies. Risk factors for self-harm were family conflict, peer groups with members indulging in self-harm, truancy and school absenteeism. Protective factors were having an understanding family, having friends and higher school competence. Risk factors for suicidal thoughts and attempts were lack of close friends and history of suicide by a friend. CONCLUSION The 12-month prevalence rates of youth self-harm in LMICs are comparable to high-income countries (HICs). The profile of risk and protective factors suggests that family-based interventions could be useful in treatment and prevention.

Unfortunately, despite gender-focused reporting on the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis, few government policies and public health efforts have explicitly addressed the gendered impacts of the pandemic. This academic review paper presents literature, from both academic and media sources, on the early effects of the COVID-19 crisis on women, specifically within the South African context. Preliminary research and reporting of the effects of COVID-19 on the South African population indicate that inequitable gendered practices negatively impact women in the general economy, the workplace, and the home.

Restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis is a standard surgical management of patients with ulcerative colitis who have cancer or dysplasia, but the oncologic risk of stapled anastomosis vs mucosectomy with handsewn anastomosis is debated. We compare the risk of new cancer or recurrence in the pouch or rectal cuff in patients with ulcerative colitis undergoing stapled anastomosis vs mucosectomy with handsewn anastomosis. METHODS This study was performed as a retrospective analysis of the clinical database at a single center, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada. The patients with ulcerative colitis associated with colorectal dysplasia or cancer who underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis between 1981 and 2009 were evaluated. The development of dysplasia or cancer at ileoanal anastomosis or in the pelvic pouch was assessed. RESULTS Eighty-one patients underwent stapled (n = 59) or handsewn (n = 22) ileal pouch-anal anastomosis; 52 had evidence of dysplasia and 29 had colorectal cancer (24 colon; 5 rectum) at the time of surgery. Median follow-up was 76.1 months. Two of 10 (20%) patients with handsewn anastomosis and 0% patients with stapled anastomosis developed metastatic cancer. One patient with a 33-year history of colitis, a previously resected right-sided colon cancer, and subsequent high-grade dysplasia in the rectum underwent a handsewn pelvic pouch and developed an unresectable adenocarcinoma at the cuff 4 years later. A second patient with a 10-year history of colitis underwent handsewn pelvic pouch and developed dysplasia in the pouch 8 years after surgery. Nine patients were dead at last follow-up (11%). Of those patients, both colorectal cancer-related deaths were in patients with handsewn anastomoses. Differences in overall 5-year survival between the groups did not reach statistical significance. This study was limited by the sample size in subgroups and the few outcome events.

The question quickly arose as to whether it was appropriate to offer medical students the opportunity to assist this staff. The dilemma stems in part from the potential impact on their psychological well-being as well as their academic and clinical performances. We sought to determine the level of anxiety of medical students during the COVID-19 outbreak, and whether it was higher among the students who chose to return to the clinical setting, especially in first-line units (i.e., emergency departments and resuscitation units). In May 2020, 1180/1502 (78.5%) undergraduate medical students at Strasbourg Medical School (France) completed a questionnaire assessing their anxiety and clinical experience. A 2018 cohort of undergraduate medical students served as the baseline. The 2020 COVID cohort had higher rates of anxiety than the 2018 cohort. This difference was specifically observed in the students who chose not to return to the clinical setting during the crisis (N = 684, 59%). At linear regression, the main factors associated with anxiety were gender (p < 0.005) and perceived clinical activity personal conditions (p < 0.001). Employment site, including COVID first-line units, was not correlated with anxiety. Working in the clinical setting during the COVID-19 outbreak is not a risk factor for anxiety in medical students.

The derivatives were initially designed and screened in silico by molecular docking studies against papain to explore the possible mode of action. The molecular interaction between the compounds and cysteine protease (papain) was found to be very similar to the interactions observed with the respective epoxide inhibitor (E-64c) of papain.

This review aims to summarize the current evidence and treatment guidelines for the management of myocarditis in the active population. RECENT FINDINGS: Physical exertion is likely a trigger for dangerous arrythmias and further propagates myocardial damage in athletes with myocarditis. For this reason, abstinence from sports is a critical facet of management in the initial inflammatory period. The use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, specifically late gadolinium enhancement, to guide return to play decisions is becoming more common in clinical practice. SUMMARY: Establishing a stepwise approach for proper diagnosis and risk stratification, with an emphasis on contemporary cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging techniques, in myocarditis is critical. After a diagnosis of myocarditis is made, it is imperative for any athlete or highly active individual to refrain from physical exercise. Additionally, therapy for heart failure should be applied in cases of myocarditis with cardiac dysfunction. Undoubtedly, COVID 19, and its potential to cause myocarditis, is sure to change the landscape of management of this disease.",2020-11-04,"Hurwitz, Benjamin; Issa, Omar",Curr Treat Options Cardiovasc Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/70776abaf88edb5d562ef2e385cd62b55ee43463.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7609375.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11936-020-00875-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33169059/,226240469.0

Ubiquitination is a mechanism that dictates surface MHC II with the attachment of a polyubiquitin chain to peptide-loaded MHC II, promoting its traffic away from the plasma membrane. In this study, we have examined how MHC II ubiquitination impacts the composition and function of both conventional CD4+ T cell and regulatory T cell (Treg) compartments. Responses were examined in two models of altered MHC II ubiquitination: MHCIIKRKI /KI mice that express a mutant MHC II unable to be ubiquitinated or mice that lack membrane-associated RING-CH 8 (MARCH8), the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for MHC II ubiquitination specifically in thymic epithelial cells. Conventional CD4+ T cell populations in thymus, blood, and spleen of MHCIIKRKI/KI and March8 -/- mice were largely unaltered. In MLRs, March8 -/-, but not MHCIIKRKI/KI, CD4+ T cells had reduced reactivity to both self- and allogeneic MHC II. Thymic Treg were significantly reduced in MHCIIKRKI/KI mice, but not March8 -/- mice, whereas splenic Treg were unaffected. Neither scenario provoked autoimmunity, with no evidence of immunohistopathology and normal levels of autoantibody.

The signal for frameshifting is composed of two essential mRNA elements; a slippery sequence (AAAUUUA) where the ribosome changes reading frame, and a stimulatory RNA structure located immediately downstream. This RNA is predicted to be a complex stem-loop but may also form an RNA pseudoknot. We have investigated the structure of the RSV frameshift signal by a combination of enzymatic and chemical structure probing and site-directed mutagenesis. The stimulatory RNA is indeed a complex stem-loop with a long stable stem and two additional stem-loops contained as substructures within the main loop region. The substructures are not however required for frameshifting. Evidence for an additional interaction between a stretch of nucleotides in the main loop and a region downstream to generate an RNA pseudoknot was obtained from an analysis of the frameshifting properties of RSV mutants translated in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation system. Mutations that disrupted the predicted pseudoknot-forming sequences reduced frameshifting but when the mutations were combined and should re-form the pseudoknot, frameshifting was restored to a level approaching that of the wild-type construct. It was also observed that the predicted pseudoknot-forming regions had reduced sensitivity to cleavage by the single-stranded probe imidazole. Overall, however, the structure probing data indicate that the pseudoknot interaction is weak and may form transiently. In comparison to other characterised RNA structures present at viral frameshift signals, the RSV stimulator falls into a novel group. It cannot be considered to be a simple hairpin-loop yet it is distinct from other well characterised frameshift-inducing RNA pseudoknots in that the overall contribution of the RSV pseudoknot to frameshifting is less dramatic.",1998-11-27,"Marczinke, Beate; Fisher, Rosamond; Vidakovic, Marijana; Bloys, Alison J; Brierley, Ian",J Mol Biol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/bd304c27b82dd29d09effec591d30c731f7ceb4d.json; document_parses/pdf_json/bed7feba6e8eb740337967721fdfd733db7cbbe7.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126186.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283698921866; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283698921866; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9813113/,12528679.0

Therefore we felt it essential to determine whether exercise training might injure a systemic right ventricle which is loaded with every heartbeat. Previous studies have shown that short term exercise training is feasible in TGA patients, but its effect on ventricular function is unclear. We demonstrate that systemic right ventricular function is preserved (and may be improved) in TGA patients with exercise training programmes that are typical of recreational and sports participation, with no evidence of injury on biomarker assessment. Stroke volume reserve during exercise correlates with exercise training response in our TGA patients, identifying this as a marker of a systemic right ventricle (SRV) that may most tolerate (and possibly even be improved by) exercise training. ABSTRACT We aimed to assess the haemodynamic effects of exercise training in transposition of the great arteries (TGA) patients with systemic right ventricles (SRVs). TGA patients have limited exercise tolerance and early mortality due to systemic (right) ventricular failure. Whether exercise training enhances or injures the SRV is unclear. Fourteen asymptomatic patients (34 ± 10 years) with TGA and SRV were enrolled in a 12 week exercise training programme (moderate and high-intensity workouts). Controls were matched on age, gender, BMI and physical activity. Exercise testing pre- and post- training included: (a) submaximal and peak; (b) prolonged (60 min) submaximal endurance and (c) high-intensity intervals. Oxygen uptake (V̇O2; Douglas bag technique), cardiac output (Q̇c, foreign-gas rebreathing), ventricular function (echocardiography and cardiac MRI) and serum biomarkers were assessed. TGA patients had lower peak V̇O2, Q̇c, and stroke volume (SV), a blunted Q̇c/V̇O2 slope, and diminished SV response to exercise (SV increase from rest: TGA = 15.2%, controls = 68.9%, P < 0.001) compared with controls. After training, TGA patients increased peak V̇O2 by 6 ± 8.5%, similar to controls (interaction P = 0.24). The magnitude of SV reserve on initial testing correlated with Q̇c training response (r = 0.58, P = 0.047), though overall, no change in peak Q̇c was observed. High-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) and N-terminal prohormone of brain naturetic peptide (NT pro-BNP) were low and did not change with acute exercise or after training. Our data show that TGA patients with SRVs in this study safely participated in exercise training and improved peak V̇O2. Neither prolonged submaximal exercise, nor high-intensity intervals, nor short-term exercise training seem to injure the systemic right ventricle.",2015,"Shafer, K M; Janssen, L; Carrick-Ranson, G; Rahmani, S; Palmer, D; Fujimoto, N; Livingston, S; Matulevicius, S A; Forbess, L W; Brickner, B; Levine, B D",The Journal of physiology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1113/jp270280; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25809342/,32904938.0

(2019) for an infectious disease, with time delays for latency and an asymptomatic phase. For fast pandemics where nobody has prior immunity and everyone has immunity after recovery, the SEIQR model decouples into two nonlinear delay differential equations (DDEs) with five parameters. One parameter is set to unity by scaling time. The simple subcase of perfect quarantining and zero self-recovery before quarantine, with two free parameters, is examined first. The method of multiple scales yields a hyperbolic tangent solution; and a long-wave (short delay) approximation yields a first order ordinary differential equation (ODE). With imperfect quarantining and nonzero self-recovery, the long-wave approximation is a second order ODE. These three approximations each capture the full outbreak, from infinitesimal initiation to final saturation. Low-dimensional dynamics in the DDEs is demonstrated using a six state non-delayed reduced order model obtained by Galerkin projection. Numerical solutions from the reduced order model match the DDE over a range of parameter choices and initial conditions. Finally, stability analysis and numerics show how a well executed temporary phase of social distancing can reduce the total number of people affected.

Identifying risk factors may promote its prevention and management. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the incidence of agitation and hyperactive delirium in postcardiotomy patients during the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support and to identify the risk factors for its development. METHODS This single center, retrospective study was conducted at Beijing Anzhen Hospital, Capital Medical University. Data were extracted from the prospective institutional registry database of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to predict risk factors. RESULTS A total of 170 consecutive adult patients underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in our hospital from January 2016 to December 2017. Ninety-four patients were included in the final analysis. The incidence of agitation and hyperactive delirium was 35% in our population of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-supported postcardiotomy patients. Agitation and delirium usually occurred within the first 3 days of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Multivariable analysis showed that history of previous stroke (without preoperative cognitive dysfunction; odds ratio, 4.425, 95% confidence interval: 1.171-16.716; p = 0.028) and mean arterial pressure reduction (before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation) ⩾ 49 mmHg (odds ratio, 7.570, 95% confidence interval: 2.366-24.219, p = 0.001) were independent risk factors for agitation and hyperactive delirium during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the prediction of agitation and hyperactive delirium was 0.704 (95% confidence interval 0.589-0.820, p = 0.001).

Taking the atmospheric environmental pollution resulting from the incineration of medical waste as an undesirable output of the healthcare system, this study analyzed the growth and decomposition of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) of healthcare services across 31 Chinese provinces during the period 2005-2016. METHODS The Meta-frontier undesirable super-efficiency slack-based measure (SBM) model and the Global Malmquist-Luenberger (GML) Index were employed to analyze the growth and decomposition of TFP using the Max DEA software. RESULTS The results revealed that the years 2009 and 2015 marked significant changes in TFP of healthcare services in Chinese provinces. During the study period, the rate of technological change (TC) slowly declined, whereas the rate of efficiency change (EC) steadily increased. With the national average being the benchmark, the results indicated that: the TFP of 17 provinces and cities exceeded the average, the EC of 16 provinces and cities exceeded the average, the TC of 9 provinces and cities exceeded the average, and the value in the Technology Gap Ratio (TGR) changes of 13 provinces and cities were above the national average.

Current therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection have primarily been adapted from previous drugs used for the treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome. In search of new potential drug candidates, we screened a library composed of 2334 clinically approved drugs and pharmacologically active compounds. The drug saracatinib, a potent inhibitor of Src-family of tyrosine kinases (SFK), was identified as an inhibitor of MERS-CoV replication in vitro. Our results suggest that saracatinib potently inhibits MERS-CoV at the early stages of the viral life cycle in Huh-7 cells, possibly through the suppression of SFK signaling pathways. Furthermore, saracatinib exhibited a synergistic effect with gemcitabine, an anticancer drug with antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. These data indicate that saracatinib alone or in combination with gemcitabine can provide a new therapeutic option for the treatment of MERS-CoV infection.",2018-05-24,"Shin, Jin Soo; Jung, Eunhye; Kim, Meehyein; Baric, Ralph S.; Go, Yun Young",Viruses,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/fcc20c80be8954f1682993217bbd2a78659a16f1.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6024778.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29795047/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v10060283,44109163.0

The COVID-19 pandemic has perturbed the functioning of healthcare systems around the world and led to changes in elective surgical care, with bariatric procedures being postponed until the end of pandemic. There is no data in the literature about the effect of a new epidemiological situation on bariatric patients. Methods: The study was designed as an online survey containing multiple open questions about bariatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was conducted among pre- and postoperative bariatric patients. Results: Out of 800 respondents, 74.53% felt anxiety about their health in regard to the present epidemiologic state. Some (72.25%) were aware of the fact that obesity was an important risk factor that could impair the course of the COVID-19 disease. Almost 30% of respondents admitted having put on weight, significantly more in the group of preoperative patients (43.8% vs. 22.69%; p < 0.001). Only 20.92% of patients had a possibility of continuing direct bariatric care; 67.3% of patients had an opportunity of remote contact with a bariatric specialist, including online consultations, teleconsultations and social media meetings. Conclusions: Limited access to medical care and quarantine lockdown may result in a deterioration of long-time operation outcomes and lower weight losses.

High rates of cerebral desaturation events (CDEs) have been reported during surgery in the beach chair position. However, correlations have not been made with blood pressure measured at the cerebral level. The purpose of this study was to examine the correlations between brachial noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) and estimated temporal mean arterial pressure (eTMAP) during CDEs in the beach chair position. METHODS Fifty-seven patients underwent elective shoulder surgery in the beach chair position. Values for eTMAP, NIBP, and rSO2 were recorded supine (0°) after induction and when a CDE occurred in the 70° beach chair position. Twenty-six patients experienced 45 CDEs, defined as a 20% drop in rSO2 from baseline. RESULTS Median reduction in NIBP, eTMAP, and rSO2 from baseline to the CDE were 48.2%, 75.5%, and 33.3%, respectively. At baseline, there was a significant weak negative correlation between rSO2 and NIBP (rs = -0.300; P = .045) and no significant association between rSO2 and eTMAP (rs = -0.202; P = .183). During CDEs, there were no significant correlations between rSO2 and NIBP (rs = -0.240; P = .112) or between rSO2 and eTMAP (rs = -0.190; P = .212). No significant correlation between the decrease in rSO2 and NIBP (rs = 0.064; P = .675) or between rSO2 and eTMAP (rs = 0.121; P = .430) from baseline to CDE was found. CONCLUSION NIBP and eTMAP are unreliable methods for identifying a CDE in the beach chair position.

In addressing those themes the chapter revisits some of the central arguments presented in the introductory chapter about the urgency and the challenges of enhancing the effectiveness of climate change education, and some of the key conclusions of critical reviews of the literature on education and climate change about the limitation of existing approaches to the subject. Those themes are: Educating students to address climate change is about engaging them in active problem solving, not contemplation. While learning from doing is valuable, to advance the field of climate change education, it is necessary to conceptualize and theorize practice. The need to think broadly about learning outcomes in climate change education. The power of contextually situated learning. A Signature project-based pedagogy to Change Climate through Education. Augmenting the capacity for climate change education among teachers and schools. The limitations of infusing climate change education in existing courses.

Larger aneurysms are believed to be more likely to rupture and should therefore be treated. Recently, flow diverters (FDs) are widely used to treat large or wide neck aneurysms. However, it can be difficult to treat them by deployment of a single FD because of its insufficient flow disturbance. To overcome this problem, double stenting technique is sometimes applied with the aim to improve the effect of blood velocity reduction. In this study, we used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to investigate the hemodynamic changes in an aneurysm when deploying virtual FDs. The results showed that the characteristics of the blood flow field inside the aneurysm did not changed much after the deployment of a single FD but underwent a large change after the deployment of two FDs. Furthermore, the velocity reduction in the aneurysm sac at a plane away from the parent artery increased from 25.9% to 92.8% when two FDs were deployed instead of one compared to no stenting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We investigated the renal kinetics of a nonionic, dimeric CA (iodixanol) formulated in 3 different osmolalities (hypo-osmolar, iso-osmolar, low-osmolar) and compared it to nonionic, low-osmolar (iopromide), and ionic, low-osmolar CAs (ioxaglate) using computed tomography for a period of 24 hours. The CAs were administered intravenously at a dosage of 4 g iodine/kg body weight. The average exposure was calculated, and urine viscosities were compared before the injection and during the time intervals of 0 to 60 minutes and 60 to 120 minutes after the injection. Renal oxygenation levels of the renal cortex and medulla were estimated using blood-oxygen-level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging. We used histologic methods to systematically analyze the gravity of vacuole formation based on the physicochemical and substance-specific properties of each CA. RESULTS Iso-osmolar and hypo-osmolar iodixanol and, to a lesser extent, iodixanol/mannitol accumulated rapidly in the kidneys during the first 5 minutes of the injection and remained higher 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours after the injection compared with iopromide and ioxaglate, which showed fast iodine excretion. Similarly, lower renal blood oxygen levels were estimated for all iodixanol formulations as compared with ioxaglate and iopromide.

Their risk of hospitalisation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and that of their households, is poorly understood. Design and settings and participants: During the peak period for COVID-19 infection in Scotland (1st March 2020 to 6th June 2020) we conducted a national record linkage study to compare the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation among healthcare workers (age: 18-65 years), their households and other members of the general population. Main outcome: Hospitalisation with COVID-19 Results: The cohort comprised 158,445 healthcare workers, the majority being patient facing (90,733 / 158,445; 57.3%), and 229,905 household members. Of all COVID-19 hospitalisations in the working age population (18-65-year-old), 17.2% (360 / 2,097) were in healthcare workers or their households. Adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic deprivation and comorbidity, the risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation in non-patient facing healthcare workers and their households was similar to the risk in the general population (hazards ratio [HR] 0.81; 95%CI 0.52-1.26 and 0.86; 95%CI 0.49-1.51 respectively). In models adjusting for the same covariates however, patient facing healthcare workers, compared to non-patient facing healthcare workers, were at higher risk (HR 3.30; 95%CI 2.13-5.13); so too were household members of patient facing healthcare workers (HR 1.79; 95%CI 1.10-2.91). On sub-dividing patient-facing healthcare workers into those who worked in front-door, intensive care and non-intensive care aerosol generating settings and other, those in front door roles were at higher risk (HR 2.09; 95%CI 1.49-2.94). For most patient facing healthcare workers and their households, the estimated absolute risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation was less than 0.5% but was 1% and above in older men with comorbidity. Conclusions: Healthcare workers and their households contribute a sixth of hospitalised COVID-19 cases.

Guidance was further informed by in-depth discussions of issues related to rapid guideline development with WHO staff (n = 6), who oversee the Organization's response to emergencies. RESULTS: We discuss criteria for considering if a rapid advice guideline is appropriate and feasible and outline the roles of various contributors across the phases of development. Further, we describe the methods and steps involved in performing rapid reviews, which are more fluid and iterative than for a standard guideline process. In general, rapid advice guidelines involve a shorter timeline, narrower scope, and the use of abbreviated methods for the evidence review.

We examined the relationship between sociodemographic, clinical, and laboratory findings with mortality among patients. METHODS: In this study, 112 patients were evaluated from February‐May 2020 and 80 patients met the inclusion criteria. Tocilizumab (TCZ) was administered, followed by methylprednisolone to patients with pneumonia severity index (PSI) score ≤ 130 and CT scan changes. Demographic data and clinical outcomes were collected. Laboratory biomarkers were monitored during hospitalization. Statistical analyses were performed with significance p≤ 0.05. RESULTS: Eighty (80) patients: 45 males (56.25%) and 35 females (43.75%) met the study inclusion criteria. Seven patients (8.75%) were deceased. An increase in mortality outcome was statistically significantly associated with higher average levels of IL‐6 with P value (0.050), and D‐dimer with P value (0.024). Bivariate logistics regression demonstrated a significant increased odds for mortality for patients with bacterial lung infections (OR: 10.83, 95% CI: 2.05 – 57.40, P=0.005) and multi‐organ damage (OR: 103.50, 95% CI: 9.92 – 1079.55, P=0.001). Multivariate logistics regression showed a statistically significant association for multi‐organ damage (AOR: 94.17, 95% CI: 7.39 ‐ 1200.78, P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We identified three main predictors for high mortality. These include interleukin‐6 (IL‐6), D‐dimer, and multi‐organ damage. The latter was the highest potential risk for in‐hospital deaths. This warrants aggressive health measures for early recognition of the problem and initiation of treatment to reverse injuries.

A limited amount of data are available evaluating operative outcomes in comparison to standard laparoscopic surgery. We completed a retrospective review comparing robotic and laparoscopic ventral hernia repair to provide safety and outcomes data to help design a future prospective trial design. METHODS A retrospective review of 215 patients undergoing ventral hernia repair (142 robotic and 73 laparoscopic) was completed at two large academic centers. Primary outcome measure evaluated was recurrence. Secondary outcomes included incidence of primary fascial closure, and surgical site occurrences. RESULTS Propensity for treatment match comparison demonstrated that robotic repair was associated with a decreased incidence of recurrence (2.1 versus 4.2%, p < 0.001) and surgical site occurrence (4.2 versus 18.8%, p < 0.001). This may be because robotic repair was associated with increased incidence of primary fascial closure (77.1 versus 66.7%, p < 0.01). Analysis of baseline patient populations showed that robotic repairs were completed on patients with lower body mass index (28.1 ± 3.6 versus 34.2 ± 6.4, p < 0.001) and fewer comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS Our retrospective data show that robotic repair was associated with decreased recurrence and surgical site occurrence.

In this work, we compared the melt-blown (MB) filter, which is commonly used for the N95 face mask, with nanofiber (NF) filter, which is gradually used as an effective mask filter, to evaluate their reusability. Extensive characterizations were performed repeatedly to evaluate some performance parameters, which include filtration efficiency, airflow rate, and surface and morphological properties, after two types of cleaning treatments. In the first cleaning type, samples were dipped in 75% ethanol for a predetermined duration. In the second cleaning type, 75% ethanol was sprayed on samples. It was found that filtration efficiency of MB filter was significantly dropped after treatment with ethanol, while the NF filter exhibited consistent high filtration efficiency regardless of cleaning types. In addition, the NF filter showed better cytocompatibility than the MB filter, demonstrating its harmlessness on the human body. Regardless of ethanol treatments, surfaces of both filter types maintained hydrophobicity, which can sufficiently prevent wetting by moisture and saliva splash to prohibit not only pathogen transmission but also bacterial growth inside. On the basis of these comparative evaluations, the wider use of the NF filter for face mask applications is highly recommended, and it can be reused multiple times with robust filtration efficiency.

Here, based on a model constructed on the basis of available experiments, we show that an FFLO state competes with an SDW phase. The SDW state in CeCoIn_{5} is stabilized when the field is directed close to the a-b plane. When the field is rotated toward the c axis, the FFLO state emerges, and the SDW phase disappears. In the FFLO state, the nodal planes with extra quasiparticles (where the superconducting order parameter is zero) are perpendicular to the field, and in the SDW phase, the quasiparticle density of states is reduced. We test this model prediction by measuring heat transported by normal quasiparticles in the superconducting state. As a function of field, we observe a reduction of thermal conductivity for field close to the a-b plane and an enhancement of thermal conductivity when field is close to the c axis, consistent with theoretical expectations. Our modeling and experiments, therefore, indicate the existence of the FFLO state when field is parallel to the c axis.",2020,"Lin, Shi-Zeng; Kim, Duk Y; Bauer, Eric D; Ronning, Filip; Thompson, J D; Movshovich, Roman",Phys Rev Lett,,#32530696,,,,,119333813.0

Countries have adopted disparate policies in tackling the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. For example, South Korea started a vigorous campaign to suppress the virus by testing patients with respiratory symptoms and tracing and isolating all their contacts, and many European countries are trying to slow down the spread of the virus with varying degrees of shutdowns. There is clearly a need for a model that can realistically simulate different policy actions and their impacts on the disease and health care capacity in a country or a region. Specifically, there is a need to identify destructive policies, i.e. policies that are, based on scientific knowledge, worse than an alternative and should not be implemented. Methods. We developed an agent-based model (REINA) using Python and accelerated it by the Cython optimising static compiler. It follows a population over time at individual level at different stages of the disease and estimates the number of patients in hospitals and in intensive care. It estimates death rates and counts based on the treatment available. Any number of interventions can be added on the timeline from a selection including e.g. physical isolation, testing and tracing, and controlling the amount of cases entering the area. The model has open source code and runs online. Results. The model uses the demographics of the Helsinki University Hospital region (1.6 million inhabitants). A mitigation strategy aims to slow down the spread of the epidemic to maintain the hospital capacity by implementing mobility restrictions. A suppression strategy initially consists of the same restrictions but also aggressive testing, tracing, and isolating all coronavirus positive patients and their contacts. The modelling starting point is 2020-02-18. The strategies follow the actual situation until 2020-04-06 and then diverge. The default mitigation scenario with variable 30−40% mobility reduction appears to delay the peak of the epidemic (as intended) but not suppress the disease. In the suppression strategy, active testing and tracing of patients with symptoms and their contacts is implemented in addition to 20−25% mobility reduction. This results in a reduction of the cumulative number of infected individuals from 820 000 to 80 000 and the number of deaths from 6000 to only 640, when compared with the mitigation strategy (during the first year of the epidemic). Discussion. The agent-based model (REINA) can be used to simulate epidemic outcomes for various types of policy actions on a timeline. Our results lend support to the strategy of combining comprehensive testing, contact tracing and targeted isolation measures with social isolation measures. While social isolation is important in the early stages to prevent explosive growth, relying on social isolation alone (the mitigation strategy) appears to be a destructive policy. The open-source nature of the model facilitates rapid further development. The flexibility of the modelling logic supports the future implementation of several already identified refinements in terms of more realistic population models and new types of more specific policy interventions. Improving estimates of epidemic parameters will make it possible to improve modelling accuracy further.",2020-04-14,"Tuomisto, Jouni T; Yrjölä, Juha; Kolehmainen, Mikko; Bonsdorff, Juhani; Pekkanen, Jami; Tikkanen, Tero",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/1fdcb519802d1fec8d0092426bcf24b612a4b6ca.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.09.20047498,215782454.0

Recently, we identified GATA4 as the master regulator of LSEC specification during development. Here, we studied endothelial GATA4 in the adult liver and in hepatic disease pathogenesis. METHODS We generated adult Clec4g-icretg/0xGata4fl/fl (Gata4LSEC-KO) mice with deficiency of Gata4 in LSEC. Livers were analyzed by histology, electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence, in-situ hybridization, and by expression profiling, ChIP- and ATAC-sequencing of isolated LSEC. For liver regeneration, partial hepatectomy was performed. As models of liver fibrosis, CDAA diet and chronic CCl4 exposure were applied. Human single cell RNAseq data sets were analyzed for endothelial alterations in healthy and cirrhotic livers. RESULTS Genetic Gata4 deficiency in LSEC of adult mice caused perisinusoidal liver fibrosis, hepatopathy and impaired liver regeneration. Sinusoidal capillarization and LSEC-to-continuous endothelial transdifferentiation were accompanied by a profibrotic angiocrine switch including de novo endothelial expression of hepatic stellate cell-activating cytokine Pdgfb. Increased chromatin accessibility and amplification by activated MYC mediated angiocrine Pdgfb expression. In CDAA diet-induced perisinusoidal liver fibrosis, LSEC showed repression of GATA4, activation of MYC and the profibrotic angiocrine switch already detected in Gata4LSEC-KO mice. Comparison of CDAA-fed Gata4LSEC-KO and control mice demonstrated that endothelial GATA4 indeed protects from dietary-induced perisinusoidal liver fibrosis. In human cirrhotic livers, GATA4-positive LSEC and endothelial GATA4 target genes were reduced, while non-LSEC endothelial cells and MYC target genes including PDGFB were enriched. CONCLUSIONS Endothelial GATA4 protects from perisinusoidal liver fibrosis by repressing MYC activation and profibrotic angiocrine signaling on the chromatin level.

However, a number of US states are currently experiencing an alarming post-lockdown resurgence of the pandemic, triggering fears for a devastating second pandemic wave. We designed a mathematical model for addressing the key question of whether or not the universal use of face masks can halt such resurgence (and possibly avert a second wave, without having to undergo another cycle of major community lockdown) in the states of Arizona, Florida, New York and the entire US. Model calibration, using cumulative mortality data for the four jurisdictions during their respective pre-lockdown and lockdown periods, show that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious individuals are, by far, the main drivers of the COVID-19 pandemic in each of the jurisdictions. The implication of this result is that detecting and isolating individuals with clinical symptoms of the pandemic alone (even if all of them are found) may not be sufficient to effectively curtail the pandemic. To achieve such control, it is crucially-necessary that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatically-infectious individuals are rapidly detected and isolated (and their contacts rapidly traced and tested). Our study highlights the importance of early implementation of the community lockdown measures. In particular, a sizable reduction in the burden of the pandemic would have been recorded in each of the four jurisdictions if the community lockdown measures were implemented a week or two earlier. These reductions are significantly increased if the early implementation of the lockdown measures was complemented with a public face mask use strategy. With all related control measures maintained at their baseline levels, this study shows that the pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed from significantly taking off if the lockdown measures were implemented two weeks earlier, and if a sizable percentage of the residents of the four jurisdictions wore face masks during the respective lockdown periods (mention what happens if lockdown measures were extended by two weeks). We simulated the pandemic in the four jurisdictions under three levels of lifting of community lockdown, namely mild, moderate and high. For the scenario where the control measures adopted are at the baseline levels during the lockdown period, our simulations show that the states of Arizona and Florida will record devastating second waves of the pandemic by the end of 2020, while the state of New York and the entire US will record milder second waves. If the community lockdown measures were lifted at the mild lifting level (i.e., only limited community contacts and business activities are allowed, in comparison to the levels of these activities allowed during the corresponding lockdown period), only the state of Florida will experience a second wave. It is further shown that the severity of the projected second waves depend on the level of lifting of the community lockdown. For instance, the projected second wave for Arizona and Florida will be more severe than their first waves. It is further shown that, for high level of lifting of community lockdown measures, the increased use of face masks after the lockdown period greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in each jurisdiction. In particular, for this high lockdown lifting scenario, none of the four jurisdictions will experience a second wave if half of their residents wear face masks consistently after their respective lockdown period. A diagnostic testing strategy that increases the maximum detection rate of asymptomatic infected individuals (followed by contact tracing and self-isolation of the detected cases) greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in all four jurisdictions, particularly if also combined with a universal face mask use strategy. Finally, it is shown that the universal use of face masks in public, with at least moderate level of compliance, could halt the post-lockdown resurgence of COVID-19, in addition to averting the potential for (and severity of) a second wave of the pandemic in each of the four jurisdictions.",2020-08-18,"Ngonghala, Calistus N.; Iboi, Enahoro; Gumel, Abba B.",Math Biosci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/990148143ec28ba388f7055a41e88e2ceb061898.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7431430.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025556420301164?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mbs.2020.108452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818515/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025556420301164,221140537.0

It has commonly been associated with pulmonary manifestations and there is a growing body of evidence of multisystem involvement of the virus. As evidenced by various case reports and cohort studies, COVID-19-associated coagulopathy has been a common manifestation amongst the critically ill and has been associated with increased mortality. The presence of venous thromboembolic events in patients who are critically ill due to COVID-19 has prompted the adoption of anticoagulation regimens aimed at preventing thromboembolic phenomena. Coagulation abnormalities have also been implicated in the progression and the severity of COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). There is strong evidence that D-dimer levels help predict which patients are at risk of thromboembolic events, progression to ARDS, DIC, immune dysregulation and mortality. We will review the utility of D-dimer as screening tool and in the risk stratification of COVID-19 patients prone to developing thromboembolic events, DIC, immune dysregulation and death. To date, the studies that have been published show the presence of elevated D-dimer levels in both the adult and pediatric populations and the measured level correlates with disease severity. Studies have also shown the relative increase of D-dimer levels in non-survivors compared to survivors. The elevation of D-dimer levels has shown to guide clinical decision making, namely the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation and mortality benefit in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia compared to severe non COVID-19 pneumonia. Although the current body of literature suggested the use of D-dimer as a risk stratification tool and as a test to augment clinical judgement regarding the initiation of anticoagulation, randomized control trials are needed to fully understand the relationship between COVID-19 infection and the efficacy of D-dimer assays in clinical decision making.",2020,"Kariyanna, Pramod Theetha; Aurora, Lyudmila; Jayarangaiah, Apoorva; Yadav, Vivek; Hossain, Naseem A; Akter, Nasrin; Salifu, Moro O; McFarlane, Isabel M",American journal of medical case reports,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32851129/,221321001.0

With the goal of performing disease quantification in lymph node (LN) stations without explicit nodal delineation, this paper presents a novel approach for disease quantification (DQ) by automatic recognition of LN zones and detection of malignant lymph nodes within thoracic LN zones via positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) images. Named AAR-LN-DQ, this approach decouples DQ methods from explicit nodal segmentation via a LN recognition strategy involving a novel globular filter and a deep neural network called SegNet. METHOD The methodology consists of four main steps: (a) Building lymph node zones models by automatic anatomy recognition (AAR) method. It incorporates novel aspects of model building that relate to finding an optimal hierarchy for organs and lymph node zones in the thorax. (b) Recognizing lymph node zones by the built lymph node models. (c) Detecting pathologic LNs in the recognized zones by using a novel globular filter (g-filter) and a multi-level support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Here, we make use of the general globular shape of LNs to first localize them and then use a multi-level SVM classifier to identify pathologic LNs from among the LNs localized by the g-filter. Alternatively, we designed a deep neural network called SegNet which is trained to directly recognize pathologic nodes within AAR localized LN zones. (d) Disease quantification based on identified pathologic LNs within localized zones. A fuzzy disease map is devised to express the degree of disease burden at each voxel within the identified LNs to simultaneously handle several uncertain phenomena such as PET partial volume effects, uncertainty in localization of LNs, and gradation of disease content at the voxel level. We focused on the task of disease quantification in patients with lymphoma based on PET/CT acquisitions and devised a method of evaluation. Model building was carried out using 42 near-normal patient data sets via contrast-enhanced CT examinations of their thorax. PET/CT data sets from an additional 63 lymphoma patients were utilized for evaluating the AAR-LN-DQ methodology. We assess the accuracy of the three main processes involved in AAR-LN-DQ via 5-fold cross validation: lymph node zone recognition, abnormal lymph node localization, and disease quantification. RESULTS The recognition and scale error for LN zones were 12.28 mm ± 1.99 and 0.94 ± 0.02, respectively, on normal CT data sets. On abnormal PET/CT data sets, the sensitivity and specificity of pathologic LN recognition were 84.1% ± 0.115 and 98.5% ± 0.003, respectively, for the g-filter-SVM strategy, and 91.3% ± 0.110 and 96.1% ± 0.016, respectively, for the SegNet method. Finally, the mean absolute percent errors for disease quantification of the recognized abnormal LNs were 8% ± 0.09 and 14% ± 0.10 for the g-filter-SVM method and the best SegNet strategy, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Accurate disease quantification on PET/CT images without performing explicit delineation of lymph nodes is feasible following lymph node zone and pathologic LN localization. It is very useful to perform LN zone recognition by AAR as this step can cover most (95.8%) of the abnormal LNs and drastically reduce the regions to search for abnormal LNs. This also improves the specificity of deep networks such as SegNet significantly. It is possible to utilize general shape information about LNs such as their globular nature via g-filter and to arrive at high recognition rates for abnormal LNs in conjunction with a traditional classifier such as SVM. Finally, the disease map concept is effective for estimating disease burden, irrespective of how the LNs are identified, to handle various uncertainties without having to address them explicitly one-by-one.",2020-05-16,"Xu, Guoping; Udupa, Jayaram K; Tong, Yubing; Odhner, Dewey; Cao, Hanqiang; Torigian, Drew A",Medical physics,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.14240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418221/,218679186.0

Recurrent incidence of secondary infections (e.g., systemic bacterial infections, cellulitis, and elevated mortality), may be associated with the presence of field-type HEV in Canadian turkey farms. We speculate that field-type HEV and vaccine/vaccine-like strains can be differentiated through analysis of the viral genomes, hexon genes, and the specific virulence factors (e.g., ORF1, E3, and fib knob domain). Nine out of sixteen spleens obtained from cases suspected of immunosuppression by HEV were analyzed. The limited data obtained showed that: (1) field-type HEV circulates in many non-vaccinated western Canadian flocks; (2) field-type HEV circulates in vaccinated flocks with increased recurrent bacterial infections; and (3) the existence of novel point mutations in hexon, ORF1, E3, and specially fib knob domains. This is the first publication showing the circulation of wild-type HEV in HEV-vaccinated flocks in Western Canada, and the usefulness of a novel procedure that allows whole genome sequencing of HEV directly from spleens, without passaging in cell culture or passaging in vivo.

A candidate vaccine, Ad26.COV2.S, is a recombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) vector encoding a full-length and stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. METHODS In this multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 1-2a trial, we randomly assigned healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 55 years (cohort 1) and those 65 years of age or older (cohort 3) to receive the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine at a dose of 5×1010 viral particles (low dose) or 1×1011 viral particles (high dose) per milliliter or placebo in a single-dose or two-dose schedule. Longer-term data comparing a single-dose regimen with a two-dose regimen are being collected in cohort 2; those results are not reported here. The primary end points were the safety and reactogenicity of each dose schedule. RESULTS After the administration of the first vaccine dose in 805 participants in cohorts 1 and 3 and after the second dose in cohort 1, the most frequent solicited adverse events were fatigue, headache, myalgia, and injection-site pain. The most frequent systemic adverse event was fever. Systemic adverse events were less common in cohort 3 than in cohort 1 and in those who received the low vaccine dose than in those who received the high dose. Reactogenicity was lower after the second dose. Neutralizing-antibody titers against wild-type virus were detected in 90% or more of all participants on day 29 after the first vaccine dose (geometric mean titer [GMT], 224 to 354) and reached 100% by day 57 with a further increase in titers (GMT, 288 to 488), regardless of vaccine dose or age group. Titers remained stable until at least day 71. A second dose provided an increase in the titer by a factor of 2.6 to 2.9 (GMT, 827 to 1266). Spike-binding antibody responses were similar to neutralizing-antibody responses. On day 14, CD4+ T-cell responses were detected in 76 to 83% of the participants in cohort 1 and in 60 to 67% of those in cohort 3, with a clear skewing toward type 1 helper T cells. CD8+ T-cell responses were robust overall but lower in cohort 3. CONCLUSIONS The safety and immunogenicity profiles of Ad26.COV2.S support further development of this vaccine candidate.

Several vaccine candidates are currently being tested in the clinic. Inactivated virus and recombinant protein vaccines can be safe options but may require adjuvants to induce robust immune responses efficiently. In this work we describe the use of a novel amphiphilic imidazoquinoline (IMDQ-PEG-CHOL) TLR7/8 adjuvant, consisting of an imidazoquinoline conjugated to the chain end of a cholesterol-poly(ethylene glycol) macromolecular amphiphile). This amphiphile is water soluble and exhibits massive translocation to lymph nodes upon local administration, likely through binding to albumin. IMDQ-PEG-CHOL is used to induce a protective immune response against SARS-CoV-2 after single vaccination with trimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the BALB/c mouse model. Inclusion of amphiphilic IMDQ-PEG-CHOL in the SARS-CoV-2 spike vaccine formulation resulted in enhanced immune cell recruitment and activation in the draining lymph node. IMDQ-PEG-CHOL has a better safety profile compared to native soluble IMDQ as the former induces a more localized immune response upon local injection, preventing systemic inflammation. Moreover, IMDQ-PEG-CHOL adjuvanted vaccine induced enhanced ELISA and in vitro microneutralization titers, and a more balanced IgG2a/IgG1 response. To correlate vaccine responses with control of virus replication in vivo, vaccinated mice were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 virus after being sensitized by intranasal adenovirus-mediated expression of the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene. Animals vaccinated with trimeric recombinant spike protein vaccine without adjuvant had lung virus titers comparable to non-vaccinated control mice, whereas animals vaccinated with IMDQ-PEG-CHOL-adjuvanted vaccine controlled viral replication and infectious viruses could not be recovered from their lungs at day 4 post infection. In order to test whether IMDQ-PEG-CHOL could also be used to adjuvant vaccines currently licensed for use in humans, proof of concept was also provided by using the same IMDQ-PEG-CHOL to adjuvant human quadrivalent inactivated influenza virus split vaccine, which resulted in enhanced hemagglutination inhibition titers and a more balanced IgG2a/IgG1 antibody response. Enhanced influenza vaccine responses correlated with better virus control when mice were given a lethal influenza virus challenge.

Previous reviews have not comprehensively synthesised the evidence on the response of health and social care systems to mass bereavement events. AIM: To synthesise the evidence regarding system-level responses to mass bereavement events, including natural and human-made disasters as well as pandemics, to inform service provision and policy during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. DESIGN: A rapid systematic review was conducted, with narrative synthesis. The review protocol was registered prospectively (www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero, CRD 42020180723). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Global Health, PsycINFO and Scopus databases were searched for studies published between 2000 and 2020. Reference lists were screened for further relevant publications, and citation tracking was performed. RESULTS: Six studies were included reporting on system responses to mass bereavement following human-made and natural disasters, involving a range of individual and group-based support initiatives. Positive impacts were reported, but study quality was generally low and reliant on data from retrospective evaluation designs. Key features of service delivery were identified: a proactive outreach approach, centrally organised but locally delivered interventions, event-specific professional competencies and an emphasis on psycho-educational content. CONCLUSION: Despite the limitations in the quantity and quality of the evidence base, consistent messages are identified for bereavement support provision during the pandemic.

The nucleoprotein of Lassa virus, termed NP, binds the viral genome. It also has an additional enzymatic activity as an exonuclease that specifically digests double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). dsRNA is a strong signal to the innate immune system of viral infection. Digestion of dsRNA by the NP exonuclease activity appears to cause suppression of innate immune signaling in the infected cell. Although the fold of the NP enzyme is conserved and the active site completely conserved with other exonucleases in its DEDDh family, NP is atypical among exonucleases in its preference for dsRNA and its strict specificity for one substrate. Here, we present the crystal structure of Lassa virus NP in complex with dsRNA. We find that unlike the exonuclease in Klenow fragment, the double-stranded nucleic acid in complex with Lassa NP remains base-paired instead of splitting, and that binding of the paired complementary strand is achieved by “relocation” of a basic loop motif from its typical exonuclease position. Further, we find that just one single glycine that contacts the substrate strand and one single tyrosine that stacks with a base of the complementary, non-substrate strand are responsible for the unique substrate specificity. This work thus provides templates for development of antiviral drugs that would be specific for viral, rather than host exonucleases of similar fold and active site, and illustrates how a very few amino acid changes confer alternate specificity and biological phenotype to an enzyme.",2012-08-28,"Hastie, Kathryn M.; King, Liam B.; Zandonatti, Michelle A.; Saphire, Erica Ollmann",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e178386cc3ca613c695540267c215754c02f2abe.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3429428.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22937163/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0044211,3955956.0

Many patients after LAGB failure choose LSG as a further bariatric surgery (secondary LSG). However, LAGB often impairs upper stomach anatomy and physiology, which may contribute to complications increased risk after secondary LSG, in comparison to surgery-naive obese patients choosing LSG (primary LSG). METHODS A retrospective cohort study was conducted on a prospective database, looking at morbidly obese patients for LSG surgery. All procedures were done by a single surgeon at the Soroka Medical Center between January 2008 and March 2013. Data were collected from hospitalization charts on demographics, biometric and bariatric status, medical and bariatric surgical history, post-LSG morbidity, and mortality. RESULTS Three hundred eight patients underwent LSG during the study period, 181 (58.8 %) had a primary LSG while 127 (41.2 %) had a secondary LSG. No mortality occurred in both groups. Odds ratio for major complication (leak, stenosis) was 3.12 [CI 0.90-10.75] among the secondary LSG group, compared to the primary LSG (p = 0.071). The risk for major complication was doubled (OR = 2, 95 % CI [1.36-3.06]) for each one of previous bariatric procedure underwent (p = 0.001). Significant differences were found between the two groups regarding number and length of readmissions and number of imaging tests (p value = 0.027, 0.022, and 0.049, respectively).

This so-called Three Midnight Rule, dating back to the 1960s as part of the Social Security Act, is being scrutinized more than half a century later given the rise in observation hospital stays. Despite the tragic emergency circumstances prompting waivers, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and Congress now have a unique opportunity to evaluate potential improvements revealed by COVID-19 regulatory relief and should consider permanent reform of the Three Midnight Rule.",2020,"Sheehy, Ann M; Locke, Charles Fs; Kaiksow, Farah A; Powell, W Ryan; Bykovskyi, Andrea Gilmore; Kind, Amy Jh",J Hosp Med,,#721648,,,,,221164660.0

A set of online questionnaires was employed to measure mental health and responses. 1,397 participants from Wuhan (age: 36.4 ± 10.7; male: 36.1%) and 2,794 age- and sex-matched participants from other areas of China (age: 35.9 ± 9.9; male: 39.0%) were recruited. RESULTS Compared with their counterparts, participants from Wuhan had significantly higher prevalence of any mental health problems (46.6% vs. 32.2%; adjusted OR=1.89, 95%CI=1.65-2.17), anxiety (15.2% vs. 6.2%; adjusted OR=2.65, 95%CI=2.14-3.29), depression (18.3% vs. 9.7%; adjusted OR = 2.11, 95%CI=1.74-2.54), suicidal ideation (10.5% vs. 7.1%; adjusted OR=1.60, 95%CI=1.28-2.02), and insomnia (38.6% vs. 27.6%; adjusted OR=1.70, 95%CI=1.48-1.96). Participants from Wuhan had a slightly higher rate of help-seeking behavior (7.1% vs. 4.2%, adjusted OR=1.76, 95% CI=1.12-2.77) but similar rate of treatment (3.5% vs. 2.7%, adjusted OR = 1.23, 95% CI=0.68-2.24) for mental problems than their counterparts. In addition, compared with their counterparts, participants from Wuhan gave higher proportions of responses regarding ""fearful"" (52% vs. 36%, P < .001), ""discrimination against COVID-19 cases"" (64% vs. 58%, P = .006), ""strictly comply with preventive behaviors"" (98.7% vs. 96%, P =.003), and ""fewer living and medical supplies"" (<2 weeks: 62% vs. 57%, P = .015).

Although several methods have been reported to date, none is considered consistently reliable. We developed a simple method for intracorporeal circular-stapled esophagojejunostomy using a modified over-and-over suture technique. The surgical outcomes of our technique were evaluated in comparison with those of open total gastrectomy (OTG). METHODS From April 2012 to August 2014, reconstruction using this method in LTG was performed for 21 consecutive patients with gastric cancer (LTG group). Their surgical outcomes were compared with those of 27 patients with gastric cancer who underwent OTG without splenectomy (OTG group) between January 2011 and April 2014. RESULTS Estimated blood loss was significantly lower, and the postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter in the LTG group than in the OTG group. The operating time and the number of harvested lymph nodes were similar between the two groups. The incidence of overall complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. Anastomotic leakage developed in one of the 21 patients in the LTG group and in two of the 27 patients in the OTG group. Anastomotic stenosis was observed in one patient in the LTG group. CONCLUSIONS We consider this method as simple and feasible for most laparoscopic surgeons with basic laparoscopic suturing skills. This method might help LTG to become an accepted standard surgical option for treatment of patients with gastric cancer.",2015,"Matsuda, Takeru; Iwasaki, Takeshi; Mitsutsuji, Masaaki; Hirata, Kenro; Maekawa, Yoko; Tsugawa, Daisuke; Sugita, Yutaka; Shimada, Etsuji; Kakeji, Yoshihiro",Surgical endoscopy,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4073-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25631108/,23997943.0

Here, we specifically analyzed kidney functions in COVID-19 patients and their relations to mortality. MethodIn this multi-centered, retrospective, observational study, we included 193 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from 2 hospitals in Wuhan, 1 hospital in Huangshi (Hubei province, 83 km from Wuhan) and 1 hospital in Chongqing (754 km from Wuhan). Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected, including data regarding to kidney functions. Data were compared among three groups: non-severe COVID-19 patients (128), severe COVID-19 patients (65) and a control group of other pneumonia (28). For the data from computed tomographic (CT) scans, we also included a control group of healthy subjects (110 cases, without abnormalities in the lung and without kidney diseases). The primary outcome was a common presence of kidney dysfunctions in COVID-19 patients and the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in a fraction of COVID-19 patients. Secondary outcomes included a survival analysis of COVID-19 patients in conditions of AKI or comorbid chronic illnesses. FindingsWe included 193 COVID-19 patients (128 non-severe, 65 severe (including 32 non-survivors), between January 6th and February 21th,2020; the final date of follow-up was March 4th, 2020) and 28 patients of other pneumonia (15 of viral pneumonia, 13 of mycoplasma pneumonia) before the COVID-19 outbreak. On hospitaladmission, a remarkable fraction of patients had signs of kidney dysfunctions, including 59% with proteinuria, 44% with hematuria, 14% with increased levels of blood urea nitrogen, and 10% with increased levels of serum creatinine, although mild but worse than that in cases with other pneumonia. While these kidney dysfunctions might not be readily diagnosed as AKI at admission, over the progress during hospitalization they could be gradually worsened and diagnosed as AKI. A univariate Cox regression analysis showed that proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, uric acid as well as D-dimer were significantly associated with the death of COVID-19 patients respectively. Importantly, the Cox regression analysis also suggested that COVID-19 patients that developed AKI had a [~]5.3-times mortality risk of those without AKI, much higher than that of comorbid chronic illnesses ([~]1.5 times risk of those without comorbid chronic illnesses). InterpretationTo prevent fatality in such conditions, we suggested a high degree of caution in monitoring the kidney functions of severe COVID-19 patients regardless of the past disease history. In addition, upon day-by-day monitoring, clinicians should consider any potential interventions to protect kidney functions at the early stage of the disease and renal replacement therapies in severely ill patients, particularly for those with strong inflammatory reactions or a cytokine storm.

Accurate clinical characterisation studies are essential to informing research, diagnosis and clinical management efforts, particularly early in a pandemic. In this scoping review we identify the clinical characteristics of patients admitted to hospital in the early months of the pandemic, focusing on symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings, and clinical outcomes. Methods: A scoping review. MEDLINE, EMBASE and Global Health databases were searched studies published from January 1st 2020 to April 28th 2020. Studies which reported on at least 100 hospitalised patients with covid-19 of any age were included. Results: Of 1,249 studies identified through the search 78 studies were eligible for inclusion; one randomized control trial and 77 observational studies presenting data on 77,443 patients admitted with covid-19. Most studies were conducted in China (82%), 9% in the US and 10% in Europe and two studies were set in more than one country. No studies included patients from low and middle income countries. Coagulopathy was underrecognised as a complication in the early months of the pandemic. Use of corticosteroids varied widely, and the use of anticoagulants was reported in only one study. Fever, cough and dyspnoea are less common in older adults; gastrointestinal symptoms, as the only presenting feature may be underrecognised. The most common laboratory finding was lymphocytopenia. Inflammatory biomarkers were commonly elevated, including C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. Typical computed tomography findings include bilateral infiltrates however imaging may be normal in early disease. Data on clinical characteristics in children and vulnerable populations were limited. Conclusions: Clinical characterisation studies from early in the pandemic indicated that covid-19 is a multisystem disease, with biomarkers indicating inflammation and coagulopathy. However, early data collection on symptoms and clinical outcomes did not consistently reflect this wide spectrum. Corticosteroid use varied widely, and anticoagulants were rarely used. Clinicians should remain vigilant to the possibility of covid-19 in patients presenting without fever, cough and dyspnoea, particularly in older adults. Further characterisation studies in different at-risk populations is needed.

The rhenium complex fac-[Re(CO)3 (κ(3)-L1)](+) (Re1) was prepared and characterized as a 'cold' surrogate of the radioactive complex. Cell uptake studies in a neuroblastoma cell line suggest that Tc1 uptake mechanism is related to the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Tissue distribution studies in CD1 mice showed that Tc1 presents high initial heart uptake and a slow washout from the heart (7.8 ± 1.3% injected dose per gram (ID/g), 30-min post-injection (p.i.); 6.3 ± 1.3% ID/g, 60-min p.i.), with heart to blood ratios of 11.8 and 9.0 at 30- and 60-min p.i., respectively.

The biodistribution profile of Tc2, where the benzylguanidine pharmacophore is absent, corroborates the fact that Tc1 does not accumulate in the heart by a simple diffusion mechanism but rather by a NET-mediated mechanism.

Aim To evaluate the knowledge Latin American gastroenterologists and endoscopists (staff physicians and residents) have about the characteristics of COVID-19, as well as the prevention measures to be taken during endoscopic procedures. Materials and methods We conducted a cross-sectional study that included gastroenterologists and endoscopists from 9 Latin American countries. An electronic questionnaire was applied that was designed to evaluate the knowledge of symptoms, risk groups for severe disease, prevention measures, and the reprocessing of endoscopes utilized in patients with COVID-19. Results Information was obtained from 133 physicians. Ninety-five percent of them correctly identified the most frequent symptoms of the virus, and 60% identified the 3 risk groups for severe disease. Sixty-six percent of those surveyed did not consider it necessary to use standard precautions during endoscopic procedures, and 30% did not consider contact precautions necessary. Forty-eight percent of the participants surveyed were not familiar with the protocol for reprocessing the endoscopes utilized in patients with COVID-19. Conclusion The majority of the gastroenterologists and endoscopists surveyed were familiar with the signs and symptoms of COVID-19 and the populations at risk for complications.

This study investigates how plastic surgery programs responded to this crisis, as well as how successful these changes were, through a survey of program directors and of residents at academic training programs in the United States. Methods: Two separate anonymous online surveys were conducted via REDCap between April 16 and June 4, 2020. The first survey was distributed to program directors, and the second was distributed to plastic surgery residents. Resident responses were then subdivided for an analysis between geographic regions. Results: Of the 59 program director responses (43.7%), the majority of programs implemented a platoon approach for resident coverage. A minority did the same for attending coverage. In total, 92% transitioned to virtual didactics only. Plastic surgery residents covered alternative services at 25% of responding institutions, and an additional 68% had a plan in place for responding to personnel shortages. Overall, residents were satisfied with their program's response in a variety of categories. When subdivided based on geographic region, respondents in the Northeast and Northwest were less satisfied with resident wellness, personal and loved ones' safety, and program communication. Conclusions: With the possibility of a ""second wave,"" successful methods of academic programs adapting to the pandemic should be communicated to reduce the future impact.

At shorter time scales, population isolation and reconnection of viruses are commonly observed, and such events are often associated with epidemics and pandemics. Here, using coalescent theory and simulations, we describe the temporal impact of population reconnection after isolation on nucleotide differences and the site frequency spectrum, as well as common summary statistics of DNA variation. We identify robust genomic signatures of population reconnection after isolation. We utilize our development to infer the recent evolutionary history of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) in Asia and South America, successfully retrieving the successive HIV subtype colonization events in these regions.

Bacterial otopathogens and respiratory viruses interact and play important roles in acute otitis media development. A better understanding of viral and bacterial interactions may lead to innovative ways to lessen the burden of this common childhood disease. RECENT FINDINGS There has been increasing evidence that acute otitis media occurs during upper respiratory infection, even in the absence of nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization. Among the types of viruses associated with acute otitis media, respiratory syncytial virus continues to be the most commonly detected. It is still unclear whether viral load plays an important role in acute otitis media development, but symptomatic upper respiratory tract infection (as opposed to asymptomatic viral infection) is crucial. Widespread use of bacterial and viral vaccines in young children, including pneumococcal conjugate and influenza vaccines, has led to the reduction in otitis media-related healthcare use between 2001 and 2011. There has been no new vaccine against respiratory viruses other than influenza. SUMMARY Progress has been made toward the reduction of the burden of acute otitis media in the last decade.

Major US news media provided information to the public about social distancing after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, potentially spurring this preventative health practice. Using data from a representative sample of US residents, this study aims to understand the relationship between news media attention and social-distancing behavior via three potential mediators: perceived effectiveness of social distancing, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, and perceived negative consequences of infection. Media trust and social norms concerning social distancing were included as potential moderators of these relationships, along with political ideology. With multiple regression and mediation analyses, we found that news media attention was positively associated with social-distancing behavior during this period. Perceived effectiveness of social distancing mediated this relationship, while perceived susceptibility and negative consequences of COVID-19 did not. Notably, media trust negatively moderated news attention's impact on the perceived effectiveness of social distancing, with the relationship being more pronounced among those who have lower trust in media. Political ideology did not moderate the relationship between news attention and perceived effectiveness. Further, social norms negatively moderated the relationship between perceived effectiveness and social-distancing behavior, with this relationship growing stronger among those uncertain about the adoption of social-distancing norms in their circle.

It is imperative to prepare for local and national disasters by increasing public knowledge on how to control bleeding, and this preparation should extend to both adults and children. The purpose of this study is to describe a training effort to teach basic hemorrhage control techniques to early adolescent children. METHODS The trauma and emergency departments at a combined level I adult and level II pediatric trauma center piloted a training initiative with early adolescents (grades 6-8) focused on 2 skills: packing a wound and holding direct pressure, and applying a Combat Application Tourniquet. Students were evaluated on each skill and completed presurveys and postsurveys indicating their likelihood to use the skills. RESULTS Of the 194 adolescents who participated in the trainings, 97% of the students could successfully pack a wound and hold pressure, and 97% of the students could apply a tourniquet. Before the training, 71% of the adolescents indicated that they would take action to assist a bleeding victim; this increased to 96% after the training. CONCLUSIONS Results demonstrate that basic hemorrhage control skills can be effectively taught to adolescents as young as 6th grade (ages 11-12 years) in a small setting with age-appropriate content and hands-on opportunities to practice the skills and such training increases students' perceived willingness to take action to assist a bleeding victim.",2020-06-11,"Sidwell, Richard A; Spilman, Sarah K; Feist, Brian; Fuchsen, Elizabeth A; Taber, Philip S; Pelaez, Carlos A",Pediatric emergency care,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1097/pec.0000000000002164; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530841/,219620216.0

Yet, blacks report higher cumulative stress exposure than whites but lower levels of common psychiatric disorders. In order to understand why blacks bear disproportionate stress exposure but similar or better mental health relative to whites, we need to consider race differences in not only stress exposure, but also stress appraisal—how upsetting stress exposures are perceived to be. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examine whether race differences in the number of reported chronic stressors across 5 domains (health, financial, residential, relationship, and caregiving) and their appraised stressfulness explain black–white differences in anxiety and depressive symptoms. Data come from 6019 adults aged older than 52 from the 2006 Health and Retirement Study. RESULTS: Older blacks in this sample experience greater exposure to chronic stressors but appraise stressors as less upsetting relative to whites. In fully adjusted models, stress exposure is related to higher levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and perceiving stress as upsetting is associated with higher symptomology for whites and blacks. We also find that blacks report greater anxiety symptoms but fewer depressive symptoms with more stress exposure relative to whites. Stress appraisal partially explains race differences in the association between stress exposure and anxiety symptoms and fully explains race differences in the association between exposure and depressive symptoms.

With the emergence of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the associated national lockdowns and restrictions, nursing home residents were restrained from being physically active. In our study, we aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19-related restrictions on PA promotion in nursing homes from an organizational-sociological lens. Methods: We collected data in eight nursing homes in Germany. Data collection included (i) semistructured interviews focusing on COVID-19-related restrictions and their effects on nursing homes from the home administrators' perspectives; (ii) open-ended surveys with nursing home staff and relatives focusing on daily routines and contact restrictions; and (iii) collection of documents such as care concepts, mission statements, and weekly activity plans. We analyzed all data with a reflexive thematic analysis approach. Results: We identified three stages of COVID-19-related changes in nursing homes that impacted PA promotion, as follows: (1) external closure and search for emergency control, (2) organizational adaptations to create a livable daily life in the internal environment, and (3) slow reintegration of interactions with the external organizational environment. Document analysis revealed that PA promotion was not part of decision programs or internal staff work descriptions. Rather, PA promotion was delegated to external service providers. The assignment of PA promotion to external providers was not structurally anchored in decision programs, which makes PA promotion not sustainable, particularly during unforeseen events that limit access to the organization. During the pandemic, executive staff believed in internal staff to buffer competencies with regard to PA promotion. Thus, executive staff often considered PA promotion relevant, even during the pandemic, but thought that PA promotion is a task that can be fulfilled by unqualified but motivated internal staff. Conclusion: While our study participants showed a high level of coping-capacity belief, it remains unclear which long-term impacts of COVID-19 on PA promotion in nursing homes are to be expected. At the practice level, executive staff in nursing homes that aim to promote PA within their organization should become aware that PA promotion needs to be incorporated into organizational structures to be implemented and continued in challenging times such as in a pandemic.",2020-10-07,"Frahsa, Annika; Altmeier, Dorothee; John, Jannika M.; Gropper, Hannes; Granz, Hanna; Pomiersky, Rebekka; Haigis, Daniel; Eschweiler, Gerhard W.; Nieß, Andreas M.; Sudeck, Gorden; Thiel, Ansgar",Front Sports Act Living,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ae05ebf4b4ff7dead550b889485202018105b851.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7739680.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33345161/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2020.589214,222141788.0

We report a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus RdRp mutant strain with a mutator phenotype. Based on structural data of RdRp, rational targeting of key residues, and screening of fidelity variants, we isolated a novel low-fidelity mutator strain of influenza virus that harbors a Tyr82-to-Cys (Y82C) single amino acid substitution in the PB1 polymerase subunit. The purified PB1-Y82C polymerase indeed showed an increased frequency of misincorporation compared with the wild-type PB1 in an in vitro biochemical assay. To further investigate the effects of position 82 on PB1 polymerase fidelity, we substituted various amino acids at this position. As a result, we isolated various novel mutators other than PB1-Y82C with higher mutation frequencies. The structural model of influenza virus polymerase complex suggested that the Tyr82 residue, which is located at the nucleoside triphosphate entrance tunnel, may influence a fidelity checkpoint. Interestingly, although the PB1-Y82C variant replicated with wild-type PB1-like kinetics in tissue culture, the 50% lethal dose of the PB1-Y82C mutant was 10 times lower than that of wild-type PB1 in embryonated chicken eggs. In conclusion, our data indicate that the Tyr82 residue of PB1 has a crucial role in regulating polymerase fidelity of influenza virus and is closely related to attenuated pathogenic phenotypes in vivo ImportanceInfluenza A virus rapidly acquires antigenic changes and antiviral drug resistance, which limit the effectiveness of vaccines and drug treatments, primarily owing to its high rate of evolution. Virus populations formed by quasispecies can contain resistance mutations even before a selective pressure is applied. To study the effects of the viral mutation spectrum and quasispecies, high- and low-fidelity variants have been isolated for several RNA viruses. Here, we report the discovery of a low-fidelity RdRp variant of influenza A virus that contains a substitution at Tyr82 in PB1. Viruses containing the PB1-Y82C substitution showed growth kinetics and viral RNA synthesis levels similar to those of the wild-type virus in cell culture; however, they had significantly attenuated phenotypes in a chicken egg infection experiment. These data demonstrated that a decreased RdRp fidelity attenuates influenza A virus in vivo, which is a desirable feature for the development of safer live-attenuated vaccine candidates.",2019,"Naito, Tadasuke; Shirai, Kazumasa; Mori, Kotaro; Muratsu, Hidetaka; Ushirogawa, Hiroshi; Ohniwa, Ryosuke L; Hanada, Kousuke; Saito, Mineki",Journal of virology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00834-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462570/,201669623.0

Lower incidence associated with prophylactic administration of Ivermectin,,,,unk,"As COVID-19 continues to rapidly spread throughout the world, incidence varies greatly among different countries. These differences raise the question whether nations with lower incidence share any medical commonalities that could be used to not only explain that lower incidence, but that could also provide guidance for potential treatments elsewhere. Such treatment would be particularly valuable if it could be used as a prophylactic against COVID-19 transmission, thereby effectively slowing spread of the disease while we await the wide availability of safe and effective vaccines. Here, we show that countries with routine mass drug administration of prophylactic chemotherapy including Ivermectin have significantly lower incidences of COVID-19. Prophylactic use of Ivermectin against parasitic infections is most common in Africa and we hence show that the reported correlation is highly significant both when compared among African nations as well as in a worldwide context. We surmise that this may be connected to Ivermectin's ability to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication which likely leads to lower infection rates. However, other pathways must exist to explain persistence of such inhibitory effect after serum levels of Ivermectin have declined. It is suggested that Ivermectin be evaluated for potential off-label prophylactic use in certain cases to help bridge the time until a safe and effective vaccine becomes available.",2020,"Hellwig, Martin D; Maia, Anabela",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,#947235,,,,,227188751.0

However, risks for mortality and morbidity among pregnant women with appendicitis remain poorly understood. This study was conducted to determine the temporal trends of appendicitis in pregnant women, and to calculate the risk of maternal–fetal mortality and near-miss marker (i.e., cardiac arrest) among pregnant women in general, and by race/ethnicity. METHODS: We conducted this retrospective study using data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2015. Joinpoint regression was used to estimate and describe temporal changes in the rates of all and acute appendicitis during the 14-year study period. We also estimated the risk of cardiac arrest, maternal, and fetal mortality among mothers of various racial/ethnic groups with a diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Within each group, patients without acute appendicitis were the referent category. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Out of the 58 million pregnancy hospitalizations during the study period, 63,145 cases (10.74 per 10,000 hospitalizations) were for acute appendicitis. There was a 5% decline (95% CI: − 5.1, − 5.0) in the rate of appendicitis hospitalizations over the period of the study. After adjusting for covariates, pregnant mothers with acute appendicitis had increased likelihood when compared to those without acute appendicitis to suffer fetal loss (OR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.85–2.28) and nearly fivefold increase for inpatient maternal death.

This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the presence of non-hypervascular hypointense nodules on hepatobiliary phase images from Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI as a risk factor of the intrahepatic distant recurrence of early stage HCC following radiofrequency ablation (RFA). METHODS A total of 132 patients who underwent preprocedural Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI followed by initial RFA were retrospectively analyzed. Post-RFA intrahepatic distant recurrence, which excluded the hypervascularization of non-hypervascular hypointense nodules detected by preprocedural Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI, was evaluated according to the presence of non-hypervascular hypointense nodules on preprocedural Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI. RESULTS Intrahepatic distant recurrence rates following RFA were higher in patients with non-hypervascular hypointense nodules (1-year: 22.5%, 2-year: 52.1%, 5-year: 89.1%) compared with in patients without non-hypervascular hypointense nodules (1-year: 7.0%, 2-year: 28.8%, 5-year: 48.7%). The presence of non-hypervascular hypointense nodules was associated with markedly increased cumulative recurrence rates of both identical and different subsegment intrahepatic distant recurrence, being an independent risk factor for post-RFA identical and different subsegment intrahepatic distant recurrence (identical: HR = 2.365, P = 0.027; different: HR = 3.276, P < 0.001).

Due to a poor healing response and degenerative changes associated with aging, rotator cuff repair failure remains common. Although cell-based therapies to augment rotator cuff repair appear promising, it is unknown whether the success of such a therapy is age-dependent. We hypothesized that autologous cell therapy would improve tendon-to-bone healing across age groups, with autologous juvenile cells realizing the greatest benefit. In this study, juvenile, adult, and aged rats underwent bilateral supraspinatus tendon repair with augmentation of one shoulder with autologous tendon-derived cell-seeded polycaprolactone scaffolds. At 8 weeks, shoulders treated with cells in both juvenile and aged animals exhibited increased cellularity, increased collagen organization, and improved mechanical properties. No changes between treated and control limbs were seen in adult rats. These findings suggest that cell delivery during supraspinatus repair initiates earlier matrix remodeling in juvenile and aged animals. This may be due to the relative ""equilibrium"" of adult tendon tissue with regards to catabolic and anabolic processes, contrasted with actively growing juvenile tendons and degenerative aged tendons. This study demonstrates the potential for autologous cell-seeded scaffolds to improve repairs in both the juvenile and aged population. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Therefore the governments have to adopt fast containment measures in order to stop its spread and to prevent the related devastating consequences. In this paper, a technique is proposed to optimally design the lock-down and reopening policies so as to minimize an aggregate cost function accounting for the number of individuals that decease due to the spread of COVID-19. A constraint on the maximal number of concomitant infected patients is also taken into account in order to prevent the collapse of the health system. The optimal procedure is built on the basis of a simple SIR model that describes the outbreak of a generic disease, without attempting to accurately reproduce all the COVID-19 epidemic features. This modeling choice is motivated by the fact that the containing measurements are actuated during the very first period of the outbreak, when the characteristics of the new emergent disease are not known but timely containment actions are required. In fact, as a consequence of dealing with poor preliminary data, the simplest modeling choice is able to reduce unidentifiability problems. Further, the relative simplicity of this model allows to compute explicitly its solutions and to derive closed-form expressions for the maximum number of infected and for the steady-state value of deceased individuals. These expressions can be then used to design static optimization problems so to determine the (open-loop) optimal lock-down and reopening policies for early-stage epidemics accounting for both the health and economic costs.",2020,"Borri, Alessandro; Palumbo, Pasquale; Papa, Federico; Possieri, Corrado",Annual reviews in control,,#987076,,,,,229365787.0

This paper proposes a new theoretical framework, Competitive Access, for transportation researchers and practitioners to use in describing and measuring regional transit access. The Competitive Access framework incorporates the concept of competitiveness between auto-based modes and transit, and is flexible enough to capture the varying contexts in which accessibility can change between and within regions. Using this framework, we propose two measures that describe the trip coverage and regional access provided by a transit network. These measures better reflect the realities experienced by riders in comparison to traditional access measures.

The purpose of this study was to determine if the incidence of pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema in COVID-19 patients was higher than in ARDS patients without COVID-19 and if this difference could be attributed to barotrauma or to lung frailty. METHODS: We identified the cohort of patients with ARDS and COVID-19 (“CoV-ARDS”), and the cohort of patients with ARDS from other causes (“noCoV-ARDS”). Patients with CoV-ARDS were admitted to ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic and had microbiologically confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. NoCoV-ARDS was identified by an ARDS diagnosis in the 5 years before the COVID-19 pandemic period. RESULTS: Pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema occurred in 23 out of 169 (13.6%) patients with CoV-ARDS and in 3 out of 163 (1.9%) patients with noCoV-ARDS (p<0.001). Mortality was 56.5% in CoV-ARDS patients with pneumomediastinum/subcutaneous emphysema and 50% in patients without pneumomediastinum (p=0.46).

The MG is not an inductive site for mucosal immunity. Rather, synthesis of immunoglobulin (Ig)A by plasma cells stimulated at distal inductive sites dominate in the milk of rodents, humans, and swine whereas IgG1 derived from serum predominates in ruminants. Despite the considerable biodiversity in the role of the MG, IgG passively transfers the maternal systemic immunological experience whereas IgA transfers the mucosal immunological experience. Although passive antibodies are protective, they and other lacteal constituents can be immunoregulatory. Immune protection of the MG largely depends on the innate immune system; the monocytes–macrophages group together with intraepithelial lymphocytes is dominant in the healthy gland. An increase in somatic cells (neutrophils) and various interleukins signal infection (mastitis) and a local immune response in the MG. The major role of the MG to mucosal immunity is the passive immunity supplied to the suckling neonate.",2015-12-31,"Butler, J.

Particularly because emergency nurses have contact with patients on the front line, they experience ethical problems in nursing while struggling with infectious diseases in an unfavorable environment. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to explore emergency nurses' ethical problems and to identify factors influencing these problems during the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus in Korea. DESIGN AND SAMPLE For this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire survey was conducted with emergency nurses working in six hospitals selected through convenience sampling from the hospitals designated for Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus patients in the capital area. METHODS Data were collected from 169 emergency nurses in Korea during August 2015. Ethical considerations: This research was approved by the Institutional Review Board of G University in Korea. RESULTS The findings of this study suggest that during the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus outbreak, emergency nurses experienced ethical problems tied to a mind-set of avoiding patients. Three factors were found to influence emergency nurses' ethical problems (in order of influence): cognition of social stigmatization, level of agreement with infection control measures, and perceived risk. CONCLUSION Through this study, we obtained information on emergency nurses' ethical problems during the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus outbreak and identified the factors that influence them. As found in this study, nurses' ethical problems were influenced most by cognitions of social stigmatization. Accordingly, to support nurses confidently care for people during future health disasters, it is most urgent to promote appropriate public consciousness that encourages healthcare workers.",2018,"Choi, Jeong-Sil; Kim, Ji-Soo",Nursing ethics,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/0969733016648205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27216828/,24303838.0

COVID-19 is a pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously known as the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). Typical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough and fatigue. As a novel disease, there are still many unsolved questions regarding COVID-19. Nevertheless, genetic analysis has demonstrated that the virus is strongly associated with certain SARS-like coronavirus originated from bats. The COVID-19 outbreak started in a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China, but the exact origin of the virus is still highly debatable. Since there is currently no registered antiviral drug for the disease, symptomatic treatments have been applied routinely to manage COVID-19 cases.

Viruses contribute to 30–70% of acute respiratory infections. Identification of these respiratory viruses is not given high priority except influenza; however, the knowledge about prevalence of non-influenza viruses, their seasonal pattern and genetic evolution have significant epidemiological value. METHODS: As a part of National Influenza-like illness surveillance programme, respiratory specimens were collected children and adults with symptoms of ILI or ARI, between January 2012 and March 2015 (including SARI cases). Real-time PCR was done to identify 13 respiratory viruses. Sequencing was done for representative isolates of each virus using ABI 3730 Genetic Analyzer. RESULTS: During the study period between January 2012 and March 2015, a total of 648 patients with symptoms of ARI were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 20.2 years (SD = 19.13, median = 18); 292 (45.1%) were children (≤13 years) and 356 (54.9%) were adults. Respiratory viruses were identified in 44% (287/648) of all patients. Influenza accounted for the maximum number of cases- 179/648 (27.6%). Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated with 34 cases (5.2%), followed by HMPV 24 (3.7%) and PIV-3 20 (3%). Four patients died due to INF A/H1N1 as a result of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (CFR 3.7%). Among the non-influenza viruses, no particular seasonality pattern was observed over the different months of the study period. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic usage in treating acute respiratory infections empirically is not justified as nearly half of ARI are due to viruses; nearly 28% of them were due to influenza viruses. Among the non-influenza viruses, RSV predominated, followed by HMPV. This study is based on an active influenza surveillance initiated after 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak, in the Union territory of Puducherry which has contributed significantly to the knowledge of the burden of influenza and non-influenza viruses among children and adults.

The purpose of this research was to inform hospital decision makers considering tele-ICUs, policy makers weighing immediate and longer-term funding and reimbursement decisions relative to tele-ICU care, and researchers conducting future work evaluating tele-ICUs. METHODS: We compared hospitals that reported providing teleintensive care to hospitals that reported not providing teleintensive care in the 2018 American Hospital Association Annual Survey (AHAAS). Differences between groups were tested using Pearson's chi-square (categorical variables) and t-tests (continuous variables) using 0.05 as the probability of Type 1 error. The study sample included all US short-term, acute care hospitals that responded to the AHAAS in 2018. Our key variable of interest was whether a hospital reported having any tele-ICU capabilities in the 2018 AHAAS. Other factors evaluated were ownership, region, beds, ICU beds, outpatient visits, emergency department visits, full-time employees, and whether a hospital was rural, a critical access hospital, a major teaching hospital, or part of a health system. FINDINGS: Larger, not-for-profit, nonrural, noncritical access, teaching hospitals that were part of a health system, particularly in the Midwest, were more likely to have tele-ICUs. Over one-third of hospital referral regions (HRRs) had zero hospitals with tele-ICUs, 4 had all hospitals with tele-ICU, and the median percent of hospitals with tele-ICU by HRR, weighted by outpatient visits, was 11.3%. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We found wide variation in the prevalence of tele-ICUs across HRRs and states. Future work should continue the evaluation of tele-ICU effectiveness and, if favorable, explore the variation we identified for improved access to teleintensive care.",2020,"Williams, Dunc; Lawrence, John; Hong, Young-Rock; Winn, Aaron",J. rural health,,#999087,,,,,222212950.0

This remote way of deciding care demands a new set of rules to ensure the quality of the complex decisions that are made for the patient group needing multidisciplinary care. Videoconference multidisciplinary teams bring with them novel forms of distraction that are under-appreciated and can impair decision-making. METHOD: A practical checklist was generated as applied to videoconference multidisciplinary teams using the principles of human factors awareness and recognition. RESULTS: Some of the strategies that should be adopted to minimise errors arising from human factors are: information technology support, a suitable environment to dial in, a global checklist employed prior to the videoconference, visible participants, avoiding distractions from other sources (e.g. e-mail, mobile phone), a videoconference sign-out and rapid dissemination of the outcomes sheet.

In this report, we analyzed the structural characteristics of the N-terminal domain of the S1 subunit (S1-NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in comparison to the SARS-CoV in particular, and to other viruses presenting similar characteristic in general. Given the severity and the wide and rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is very likely that the virus recognizes other receptors/co-receptors besides the ACE2. The NTD of the SARS-CoV-2 contains a receptor-binding motif different from that of SARS-CoV, with some insertions that could confer to the new coronavirus new receptor binding abilities. In particular, motifs similar to the insertion 72GTNGTKR78 have been found in structural proteins of other viruses; and these motifs were located in putative regions involved in recognizing protein and sugar receptors, suggesting therefore that similar binding abilities could be displayed by the SARS-CoV-2 S1-NTD.

Eighty RA patients were randomized to tocilizumab (n = 40) or conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and glucocorticoids (GC) (n = 40) for 3 months. Forty healthy subjects with similar age and sex served as controls. We measured: (a)perfused boundary region (PBR) of the sublingual arterial microvessels (increased PBR indicates reduced glycocalyx thickness), (b)pulse wave velocity (PWV), (c)global LV longitudinal strain (GLS), (d)global work index (GWI) using speckle tracking echocardiography and e)C-reactive protein (CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyls (PCs) as oxidative stress markers at baseline and post-treatment. Compared to controls, RA patients had impaired glycocalyx and myocardial deformation markers (P < 0.05). Compared with baseline, tocilizumab reduced PBR(2.14 ± 0.2 versus 1.97 ± 0.2 µm; P < 0.05) while no significant differences were observed post-csDMARDs + GC(P > 0.05). Compared with csDMARDs + GC, tocilizumab achieved a greater increase of GLS, GWI and reduction of MDA, PCs and CRP(P < 0.05). The percent improvement of glycocalyx thickness (PBR) was associated with the percent decrease of PWV, MDA, PCs and the percent improvement of GLS and GWI(P < 0.05). Tocilizumab improves endothelial function leading to a greater increase of effective myocardial work than csDMARDs + GC through a profound reduction of inflammatory burden and oxidative stress.

However, the characteristics of ACE2-positive cells and the expression of other SARS-CoV-2 process-related genes are still worthy of further investigation. Here, we performed singlecell RNA seq (scRNA-seq) analysis on 853 male embryo primordial germ cells (PGCs) and 2,854 normal testis cells to assess the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the male reproductive system from embryonic stage to adulthood. We also collected and constructed the scRNA-seq library on 228 Sertoli cells from three non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA) patients to assess the effects at disease state. We found that ACE2 expressing cells existed in almost all testis cell types and Sertoli cells had highest expression level and positive cells ratio. Moreover, ACE2 was also expressed in human male PGCs. In adulthood, the level of ACE2 expression decreased with the increase of age. We also found that ACE2 positive cells had high expressions of stress response and immune activation-related genes. Interestingly, some potential SARS-CoV-2 process-related genes such as TMPRSS2, BSG, CTSL and CTSB had different expression patterns in the same cell type.

Participants were asked to make triage decisions in case-based vignettes, exploring a variety of factors. They also were asked to assess how sure they were about their decisions, and how such decisions should be reached. Results: The survey was completed in full by 1626 participants in April 2020. Median age was 39 years (range 12-80 years), 984 (61%) were female. Patient prognosis, responsibility towards others, the absence of behavior-induced co-morbidities, and younger age were rated the most important triage criteria, while participants found that insurance status, social status, and nationality should not play a substantial role. Ethics-committees and point systems were regarded potentially helpful for triage decision-making, while decisions based on order of presentation (first-come first-serve) or on a legal basis were viewed critically. Participants were least sure about their decision when dealing with age or behavior-induced co-morbidities. Overall, women were surer about their decisions than men, participants of Christian faith were also more secure about their decision than atheists-agnostics.

The new normal for adipose tissue in COVID 19 will be highlighted. Expert Opinion: ADSCs may potentially be used in COVID-19. However, it has been speculated that ACE2 receptors are responsible for the pathogenesis of adipose tissue overgrowth and may be a potential danger in terms of the relationship between ACE2 receptors and COVID19.

This includes the impact on physical activity, dietary patterns, alcohol consumption and the resulting consequences, for example increases in body weight. Other risk factors for increases in BP and cardiovascular risk such as smoking, emotional/psychologic stress, changes in sleep patterns and diurnal rhythms may also exhibit significant changes in addition to novel factors such as air pollution and environmental noise.

In this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis on the codon usage bias (CUB) of 13 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different geo-locations (countries) in an attempt to characterize it, unravel the main force shaping its pattern, and understand its adaptation to Homo sapiens. Overall results revealed that, SARS-CoV-2 codon usage is slightly biased similarly to other RNA viruses. Nucleotide and dinucleotide compositions displayed a bias toward A/U content in all codon positions and CpU-ended codons preference, respectively. Eight common putative preferred codons were identified, and all of them were A/U-ended (U-ended: 7, A-ended: 1). In addition, natural selection was found to be the main force structuring the codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2. However, mutation pressure and other factors such as compositional constraints and hydrophobicity had an undeniable contribution. Two adaptation indices were utilized and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is moderately adapted to Homo sapiens compared to other human viruses.

In Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, non-prescribed dispensing of antibiotics in community drug retail outlets (CDROs) has been flagged as one of the contributing factors for the widespread misuse of antibiotics in the community. OBJECTIVE The current review aimed to estimate the proportion of non-prescription antibiotics requests or consultations that resulted in provision of antibiotics without a valid prescription among CDROs in SSA region, and describe the type of antibiotics dispensed. METHODS A literature search was conducted using PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus and Google Scholar. We also searched reference lists of relevant articles. Random effect model meta-analysis was employed to determine the pooled proportion of over the counter sale of antibiotics. Subgroup and meta-regression was undertaken to explore the potential cause of heterogeneity in effect size across studies. RESULTS Of 671 total citations retrieved, 23 met the inclusion criteria (seven cross-sectional questionnaire-based surveys and 16 cross-sectional client-based studies). The overall pooled proportion of non-prescription antibiotics requests or consultations that resulted in supply of antibiotics without prescription was 69% (95% CI 58-80). Upper respiratory tract infections and/or acute diarrhoea were the most frequently presented case scenarios, and amoxicillin and co-trimoxazole were the most frequently dispensed antibiotics to treat those symptoms. CONCLUSIONS Non-prescribed dispensing of antibiotics was found to be a common practice among CDROs in several SSA countries. Ease of access to and overuse of antibiotics can potentially accelerate the emergence of resistance to antibiotics available in the region. Our review highlights the need for a stringent enforcement of existing policies and/or enacting new regulatory frameworks that would regulate antibiotic supply, and training and educational support for pharmacy personnel (e.g. pharmacists, pharmacy assistants) regarding judicious use of antibiotics and the importance of antimicrobial stewardship.",2021-01-14,"Belachew, Sewunet Admasu; Hall, Lisa; Selvey, Linda A",Antimicrobial resistance and infection control,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13756-020-00880-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33446266/,231608025.0

Citation screening was conducted independently in duplicate. Study characteristics, interventions, and outcomes were extracted from included studies by two independent reviewers. Outcomes of interest included impact of decontamination interventions on surgical mask performance and germicidal effects. FINDINGS: Seven studies met eligibility criteria: one evaluated the effects of heat and chemical interventions applied after mask use on mask performance, and six evaluated interventions applied prior to mask use to enhance antimicrobial properties and/or mask performance. Mask performance and germicidal effects were evaluated with heterogenous test conditions. Safety outcomes were infrequently evaluated. Mask performance was best preserved with dry heat decontamination. Good germicidal effects were observed in salt-, N-halamine-, and nanoparticle-coated masks.

Methods: A randomized cross-sectional, population-based telephone survey study was conducted among the Cantonese-speaking population aged over 15 years in Hong Kong. Descriptive statistics were reported. A stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the independent associations between risk perceptions, socioeconomic factors, household characteristics, and personal background. Findings: Final study sample comprised of 1002 respondents with a 63% response rate. The majority of respondents (82.3%) did not perceive Hong Kong as a disaster-susceptible city.

Yet, the analytical sensitivity required is not well defined and it is unclear how available assays compare. METHODS: For the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay (Abbott Molecular Inc.; abbreviated as m2000), we determined that it could detect viral concentrations as low as 26 copies/mL, we defined the relationship between cycle number and viral concentrations, and we tested naso- and oropharyngeal swab specimens from N = 8,538 consecutive individuals. Using the m2000 as a reference assay method, we described the distribution of viral concentrations in these patients. We then used selected clinical specimens to determine the positive percent agreement of two other assays with more rapid turnaround times (Cepheid Xpert Xpress (Cepheid Inc.; GeneXpert, N = 27 specimens) and a laboratory developed test on the Luminex ARIES system (Luminex Corporation; ARIES LDT, N = 50)) as a function of virus concentrations, from which we projected their false negative rates in our patient population. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 27% (95% confidence interval of 26-28%) of all specimens. Estimated viral concentrations were widely distributed and 17% (16-19%) of positive individuals had viral concentrations below 845 copies/mL.

Immune regulation plays a key role in anti-tumour therapy. The present study explored the anti-tumour effect of ESPs released by Angiostrongylus cantonensis. In Hepa1-6 mouse tumour models, ESPs significantly reduced tumour growth. Tumour-bearing mice treated with ESPs had significantly higher CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell counts than those treated with Freund's adjuvant. In vitro, human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells, human lung cancer A549 cells, and normal human liver HL-7702 cells were co-incubated with ESPs for 24 h and 48 h. ESPs significantly accelerated HepG2 apoptosis but had no inhibitory effect on the proliferation of A549 and HL-7702 cells. Apoptotic HepG2 cells displayed condensed nuclei, apoptotic bodies, and swollen endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-related factors activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) in HepG2 cells increased with increasing ESP concentration and treatment time. Calreticulin (CRT) is a key effector protein of ESPs, and recombinant calreticulin (rCRT) was produced in BL21 Escherichia coli (E. coli). In contrast to ESPs, rCRT markedly reduced the proliferation of HepG2 cells. The expression levels of ATF6 and CHOP in HepG2 cells treated with 30 µg/mL rCRT significantly increased at 48 h.

291675,2aycn208,,ArXiv,A comprehensive spatial-temporal infection model,,,,arxiv,"Motivated by analogies between the spreading of human-to-human infections and of chemical processes, we develop a comprehensive model that accounts both for infection and for transport. In this analogy, the three different populations of infection models correspond to three chemical species. Areal densities emerge as the key variables, thus capturing the effect of spatial density. We derive expressions for the kinetics of the infection rates and for the important parameter R0, that include areal density and its spatial distribution. Coupled with mobility the model allows the study of various effects. We first present results for a batch reactor, the chemical process equivalent of the SIR model. Because density makes R0 a decreasing function of the process extent, the infection curves are different and smaller than for the standard SIR model. We show that the effect of the initial conditions is limited to the onset of the epidemic. We derive effective infection curves for a number of cases, including a back-and-forth commute between regions of low and high R0 environments. We then consider spatially distributed systems. We show that diffusion leads to traveling waves, which in 1-D geometries propagate at a constant speed and with a constant shape, both of which are sole functions of R0. The infection curves are slightly different than for the batch problem, as diffusion mitigates the infection intensity, thus leading to an effective lower R0. The dimensional wave speed is found to be proportional to the product of the square root of the diffusivity and of an increasing function of R0, confirming the importance of restricting mobility in arresting the propagation of infection. We examine the interaction of infection waves under various conditions and scenarios, and extend the wave propagation analysis to 2-D heterogeneous systems.",2020-08-28,"Ramaswamy, Harisankar; Oberai, Assad A; Yortsos, Yannis C",,,,2008.12766,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.12766v2.pdf,221370552.0

Participants completed measures assessing thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, loneliness, and suicide risk, as well as whether they (a) were currently under a stay‐at‐home order and (b) had experienced a recent job loss due to the pandemic. RESULTS: Results revealed a significant indirect relation of stay‐at‐home order status to suicide risk through thwarted belongingness. Further, whereas recent job loss was significantly correlated with suicide risk, neither the direct relation of job loss to suicide risk (when accounting for their shared relations to perceived burdensomeness) nor the indirect relation through perceived burdensomeness was significant.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the role of internet hospitals during the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: Online epidemic-related consultations from multicenter internet hospitals in China during the COVID-19 epidemic were collected. The counselees were described and classified into seven type groups. Symptoms were recorded and compared with reported patients with COVID-19. Hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were detected within each counselees’ group to evaluate the social panic of the epidemic along with the consequent medical-seeking behaviors. The counselees’ motivation and the doctors’ recommendation for an offline visit were compared. Risk factors affecting the counselees’ tendency of hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were explored by logistic regression models. The epidemic prevention and control measures based on internet hospitals were listed, and the corresponding effects were discussed. RESULTS: A total of 4913 consultations were enrolled for analysis with the median age of the counselees at 28 years (IQR 22-33 years). There were 104 (2.12%) healthy counselees, 147 (2.99%) hypochondriacal counselees, 34 (0.69%) exposed counselees, 853 (17.36%) mildly suspicious counselees, 42 (0.85%) moderately suspicious counselees, 3550 (72.26%) highly suspicious counselees, and 183 (3.72%) severely suspicious counselees. A total of 94.20% (n=4628) of counselees had epidemic-related symptoms with a distribution similar to those of COVID-19. The hypochondriacal suspicion (n=2167, 44.11%) was common. The counselees’ motivation and the doctors’ recommendation for offline visits were inconsistent (P<.001) with a Cohen kappa score of 0.039, indicating improper medical-seeking behaviors. Adult counselees (odds ratio [OR]=1.816, P<.001) with epidemiological exposure (OR 7.568, P<.001), shortness of breath (OR 1.440, P=.001), diarrhea (OR 1.272, P=.04), and unrelated symptoms (OR 1.509, P<.001) were more likely to have hypochondriacal suspicion. Counselees with severe illnesses (OR 2.303, P<.001), fever (OR 1.660, P<.001), epidemiological exposure history (OR 1.440, P=.01), and hypochondriacal suspicion (OR 4.826, P<.001) were more likely to attempt an offline visit. Reattending counselees (OR 0.545, P=.002) were less motivated to go to the offline clinic. CONCLUSIONS: Internet hospitals can serve different types of epidemic counselees, offer essential medical supports to the public during the COVID-19 outbreak, reduce the social panic, promote social distancing, enhance the public’s ability of self-protection, correct improper medical-seeking behaviors, reduce the chance of nosocomial cross-infection, and facilitate epidemiological screening, thus, playing an important role on preventing and controlling COVID-19.",2020-04-14,"Gong, Kai; Xu, Zhong; Cai, Zhefeng; Chen, Yuxiu; Wang, Zhanxiang",J Med Internet Res,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7159055.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.2196/18908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32250962/,215410632.0

This unique group is open to all who work in the pharmaceutical sector at any level and in any discipline who share the vision of a pharmaceutical system that places an understanding of HFE at the heart of improving the use of healthcare products throughout their life cycles including their supply chains. RESULTS: For this complex system to work efficiently it is paramount that we have effective coordination and integration between the different elements in the supply chain. HFE can give valuable insights and solutions for developing these complex social-technical systems effectively.

The overall effect of IFN is increasing global SUMOylation, pointing to SUMO as part of the antiviral stress response. Viral agents have developed different mechanisms to counteract the antiviral activities exerted by SUMO, and some viruses have evolved to exploit the host SUMOylation machinery to modify their own proteins.

Two structures are wild-type BC in complex with two ADP molecules and two Ca(2+) ions or two ADP molecules and one Mg(2+) ion. One ADP molecule is in the position normally taken by the ATP substrate, whereas the other ADP molecule occupies the binding sites of bicarbonate and biotin.

Almost 80% of the patients who became autoantibody-negative during the GFD were positive for only one of the islet-specific autoimmune markers at CD diagnosis, with none of them developing diabetes. Conversely, 80% of the CD patients positive at diagnosis for ≥2 islet-specific autoantibodies were still positive after more than two years of GFD, with 25% of them developing T1D. CONCLUSIONS Various factors appear to influence, individually or in combination, the effects of the GFD on pancreatic islet-specific autoimmune response detected at CD diagnosis. These factors include the number of diabetes autoantibodies found at CD diagnosis, the adherence to the GFD, its duration and an asymptomatic clinical presentation of CD.

ZIKV is primarily transmitted by mosquitoes, but can persist in human semen and sperm, and sexual transmission has been documented. Moreover, exposure of type-I interferon knockout mice to ZIKV results in severe damage to the testes, epididymis and sperm. Candidate ZIKV vaccines have shown protective efficacy in preclinical studies carried out in animal models, and several vaccines have entered clinical trials. Here, we report that administration of a synthetic DNA vaccine encoding ZIKV pre-membrane and envelope (prME) completely protects mice against ZIKV-associated damage to the testes and sperm and prevents viral persistence in the testes following challenge with a contemporary strain of ZIKV.

Hospitals become rapidly overwhelmed when patients requiring life-saving support outpace available capacities. We here describe methods used by a university hospital to forecast caseloads and time to peak incidence. METHODS: We developed a set of models to forecast incidence among the hospital catchment population and describe the COVID-19 patient hospital care-path. The first forecast utilized data from antecedent allopatric epidemics and parameterized the care path model according to expert opinion (static model). Once sufficient local data were available, trends for the time dependent effective reproduction number were fitted and the care-path was re-parameterized using hazards for real patient admission, referrals, and discharge (dynamic model). RESULTS: The static model, deployed before the epidemic, exaggerated the bed occupancy (general wards 116 forecasted vs 66 observed, ICU 47 forecasted vs 34 observed) and predicted the peak too late (general ward forecast April 9, observed April 8, ICU forecast April 19, observed April 8). After April 5, the dynamic model could be run daily and precision improved with increasing availability of empirical local data. CONCLUSIONS: The models provided data-based guidance in the preparation and allocation of critical resources of a university hospital well in advance of the epidemic surge, despite overestimating the service demand. Overestimates should resolve when population contact pattern before and during restrictions can be taken into account, but for now they may provide an acceptable safety margin for preparing during times of uncertainty.",2020,"Donker, Tjibbe; Bürkin, Fabian; Wolkewitz, Martin; Haverkamp, Christian; Christoffel, Dominic; Kappert, Oliver; Hammer, Thorsten; Busch, Hans-Jörg; Biever, Paul; Kalbhenn, Johannes; Bürkle, Hartmut; Kern, Winfried; Wenz, Frederik; Grundmann, Hajo",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,#765932,,,,,220303023.0

Platinum electrodes turn black in this process, while they behave differently when the polarity is not altered. We prove that the modification of Pt is associated with highly energetic impact of nanobubbles rather than with any electrochemical process. Experiments Nanobubbles are generated by planar Pt or Ti microelectrodes. The process is driven by a series of alternating or single polarity pulses. In the case of Ti electrodes a Pt plate is separated by a gap from the electrodes. Nanoparticles on the surface of platinum are investigated with a scanning electron microscope and elemental composition is analysed using an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer. Findings Vigorous formation of Pt nanoparticles with a size of 10â¯nm is observed when the process is driven by the alternating polarity pulses. The effects of Pt corrosion have different character and cannot explain the phenomenon. Similar nanoparticles are observed when the Pt plate is exposed to a stream of nanobubbles. The process is explained by spontaneous combustion of hydrogen and oxygen nanobubbles on Pt surface.

The biological function of α-syn remains elusive; however, increasing evidence suggests that the protein is involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle fusion, signifying the importance of α-syn-lipid interactions. We show that α-syn preferentially binds to GM1-rich, liquid-ordered lipid domains on cytoplasmic membranes by using unroofed cells, which encapsulates lipid complexity and cellular topology. Moreover, proteins (Rab3a, syntaxin-1A, and VAMP2) involved in exocytosis also localize with α-syn, supporting its proposed functional role in exocytosis. To investigate how these lipid/protein interactions influence α-syn at the residue level, α-syn was derivatized with an environmentally sensitive fluorophore (7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl [NBD]) at different N- and C-terminal sites. Measurements of NBD fluorescence lifetime distributions reveal that α-syn adopts a multitude of membrane-bound conformations, which were not recapitulated in simple micelle or vesicle models, indicating an exquisite sensitivity of the protein to the complex lipid environment. Interestingly, these data also suggest the participation of the C terminus in membrane localization, which is generally overlooked and thus emphasize the need to use cellularly derived and biologically relevant membranes for biophysical characterization. Collectively, our results demonstrate that α-syn is more conformationally dynamic at the membrane interface than previously appreciated, which may be important for both its physiological and pathological functions.",2020-07-27,"Kaur, Upneet; Lee, Jennifer C",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2006291117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32719116/,220840105.0

This article presents a single centre cohort of this challenging subtype of stroke, describing the technical procedure and analysing the angiographic and clinical outcome. METHODS Clinical and imaging data of all consecutive patients between July 2008 and March 2013 with intracranial artery occlusion in the anterior circulation and additional occlusion or pseudo-occlusion of the cervical ICA were retrospectively analysed with respect to demographical and clinical characteristics. Technical approach, recanalization rate, recanalization time and short-term clinical outcome were determined. RESULTS A total of 43 patients with tandem occlusion in the anterior circulation met the inclusion criteria. Out of these, 32 (74.4%) occlusions and 11 (25.6%) pseudo-occlusions of the extracranial ICA with additional occlusion of the distal segment of the ICA in 7.0% (3/43), the M1-segment of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 81.4% (35/43) or the M2-segment of the MCA in 11.6% (5/43) of cases were treated with combined endovascular approach including extracranial stenting with angioplasty and intracranial mechanical thrombectomy. In 76.7% of cases, an angiographic recanalization result of 2b or 3 using the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score was achieved. Mean time from first angiographic series to recanalization was 103 min. A modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of ≤ 2 was achieved in 32.6% at the time of discharge.

The animal contact network aggregated at hourly level was highly variable and dynamic within and between days, for both network structure (network degree distribution) and individual rank of degree distribution in the network (degree order). We integrated network degree distribution and degree order heterogeneities with a commonly used contact-based, directly transmitted disease model to quantify the effect of these two sources of heterogeneity on the infectious disease dynamics. Four conditions were simulated based on the combination of these two heterogeneities. Simulation results indicated that disease dynamics and individual contribution to new infections varied substantially among these four conditions under both parameter settings.

In view of this, HCWs were evaluated for their knowledge of and attitude towards MERS in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A cross sectional study was performed in two hospitals of Qassim region in Saudi Arabia. A total of 280 healthcare workers were selected to participate in this study. Knowledge and attitude were assessed by using self-administered and pretested questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were carried out to express participants’ demographic information, mean knowledge score and mean attitude score of HCWs. Inferential statistics (Mann–Whitney U test and Kruskal Wallis tests, p < 0.05) were used to examine differences between study variables. Chi squares tests were used to assess the association between study variables and attitude questions. Spearman’s rho correlation was used to identify the association between the knowledge, attitude scores. RESULT: Participants demonstrated good knowledge and positive attitude towards MERS. The mean scores of knowledge and attitude were 9.45 ± 1.69 (based on 13 knowledge questions) and 1.82 ± 0.72 (based on 7 attitude questions). The correlation between knowledge and attitude was significant (correlation coefficient: 0.12; P <0.001).

Crude extracts from sonicated P. multocida strain Dainai‐1, which is serotype A isolated from bovine pneumonia, were found to inhibit proliferation of mouse spleen cells stimulated with Con A. The crude extract was purified by cation and anion exchange chromatography and hydroxyapatite chromatography. Its molecular weight was 27 kDa by SDS‐PAGE and it was named PM27. PM27 was found to inhibit proliferation of mouse spleen cells stimulated with Con A as effectively as did the crude extract; however, its activity was lost after heating to 100°C for 20 min. PM27 did not directly inhibit proliferation of HT‐2 cells, which are an IL‐2‐dependent T cell line, nor did it modify IL‐2 production by Con A‐stimulated mouse spleen cells. The N‐terminal amino acid sequence of PM27 was determined and BLAST analysis revealed its identity to uridine phosphorylase (UPase) from P. multocida. UPase gene from P. multocida Dainai‐1 was cloned into expression vector pQE‐60 in Escherichia coli XL‐1 Blue. Recombinant UPase (rUPase) tagged with His at the C‐terminal amino acid was purified with Ni affinity chromatography. rUPase was found to inhibit proliferation of mouse spleen cells stimulated with Con A; however, as was true for PM27, its activity was lost after heating to 100°C for 20 min.

The smaller size fractions, ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5; fine particles) and ≤0.1 μm (PM0.1; ultrafine particles), show the highest bioactivity but acquiring sufficient mass for in vitro and in vivo toxicological studies is challenging. We review the suitability of available instrumentation to collect the PM mass required for these assessments. Five different microenvironments representing the diverse exposure conditions in urban environments are considered in order to establish the typical PM concentrations present. The highest concentrations of PM2.5 and PM0.1 were found near traffic (i.e. roadsides and traffic intersections), followed by indoor environments, parks and behind roadside vegetation. We identify key factors to consider when selecting sampling instrumentation. These include PM concentration on-site (low concentrations increase sampling time), nature of sampling sites (e.g. indoors; noise and space will be an issue), equipment handling and power supply. Physicochemical characterisation requires micro- to milli-gram quantities of PM and it may increase according to the processing methods (e.g. digestion or sonication). Toxicological assessments of PM involve numerous mechanisms (e.g. inflammatory processes and oxidative stress) requiring significant amounts of PM to obtain accurate results. Optimising air sampling techniques are therefore important for the appropriate collection medium/filter which have innate physical properties and the potential to interact with samples. An evaluation of methods and instrumentation used for airborne virus collection concludes that samplers operating cyclone sampling techniques (using centrifugal forces) are effective in collecting airborne viruses. We highlight that predictive modelling can help to identify pollution hotspots in an urban environment for the efficient collection of PM mass.

ANIMALS 13 client- or student-owned dogs. PROCEDURES Pressure sensors were placed over the calcaneus and cranial tibial surface. Dogs then were fitted with a fiberglass cast on a pelvic limb extending from the digits to the stifle joint (tall cast). Pressure induced over the calcaneus and proximal edge of the cast at the level of the cranial tibial surface was simultaneously recorded during ambulation. Subsequently, the cast was shortened to end immediately proximal to the calcaneus (short cast), and data acquisition was repeated. Pressure at the level of the calcaneus and cranial tibial surface for both cast configurations was compared by use of paired t tests. RESULTS The short cast created significantly greater peak pressure at the level of the calcaneus (mean ± SD, 0.2 ± 0.07 MPa), compared with peak pressure created by the tall cast (0.1 ± 0.06 MPa). Mean pressure at the proximal cranial edge of the cast was significantly greater for the short cast (0.2 ± 0.06 MPa) than for the tall cast (0.04 ± 0.03 MPa).

STUDY DESIGN Prospective clinical trial. ANIMALS Sixteen healthy client-owned female dogs undergoing routine single-port LapOVE. METHODS Anesthetized dogs were placed in dorsal recumbency on a tilting operation table. The operating laparoscope was introduced and, after inspection of abdominal organs, directed toward the randomly assigned ovary. Fifteen-second video recordings were taken at each table rotation of 0°, 22.5°, and 45°. LapOVE was performed using the single-port technique. The procedure was repeated on the contralateral side. Blinded observers (3 inexperienced [IO], 3 experienced [EO], 1 expert [EE]) evaluated the recordings postoperatively for visibility of ovary/ovarian bursa, ovario-uterine transition, and other organs. RESULTS In the 0° position, ovarian structures were rarely visualized (IO, 13/96 [13.5%]; EO, 7/96 [7.3%]; EE, 5/32 [15.6%]). In the 22.5° position, visualization improved significantly for EO (26/96 [27.1%], P < .001).

Here, we explain how substantial biases are introduced by two important, yet largely ignored, assumptions at the core of the vast majority of such models. METHODS AND FINDINGS: First, we use analytical methods to show that (i) ignoring the latent period or (ii) making the common assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods (when including the latent period) always results in underestimating the basic reproductive ratio of an infection from outbreak data. We then proceed to illustrate these points by fitting epidemic models to data from an influenza outbreak. Finally, we document how such unrealistic a priori assumptions concerning model structure give rise to systematically overoptimistic predictions on the outcome of potential management options.

ANALYTIC APPROACH: Evaluated the association of COVID-19 with AKI after controlling for time-invariant factors at admission (e.g., demographics, comorbidities) and time-varying factors updated continuously during hospitalization (e.g., vital signs, medications, laboratory results, respiratory failure) using time-updated Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Of the 22,122 patients hospitalized between, 2,600 tested positive and 19,522 tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Compared to patients who tested negative, patients with COVID-19 had more AKI [30.6% vs. 18.2%, absolute risk difference 12.5 (95% CI, 10.6, 14.3)%] and dialysis-requiring AKI (8.5% vs. 3.6%) and lower recovery from AKI (58% vs. 69.8%]. Compared to patients who tested negative, patients with COVID-19 had higher inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, ferritin), and greater use of vasopressors and diuretics. Compared to patients who tested negative, patients with COVID-19 had higher rate of AKI in univariable analysis (HR, 1.84 [1.73, 1.95]). In fully adjusted model controlling for demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, medications, and laboratory results, COVID-19 remained associated with a high rate of AKI (adjusted HR, 1.40 [1.29-1.53]). LIMITATIONS: Possibility of residual confounding. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is associated with high rates of AKI not fully explained by adjustment for known risk factors. This suggests the presence of mechanisms of AKI not accounted for in this analysis, which may include a direct effect of COVID-19 on the kidney or other unmeasured mediators. Future studies should evaluate the possible unique pathways by which COVID-19 may cause AKI.",2021-01-08,"Moledina, Dennis G.; Simonov, Michael; Yamamoto, Yu; Alausa, Jameel; Arora, Tanima; Biswas, Aditya; Cantley, Lloyd G.; Ghazi, Lama; Greenberg, Jason H.; Hinchcliff, Monique; Huang, Chenxi; Mansour, Sherry G.; Martin, Melissa; Peixoto, Aldo; Schulz, Wade; Subair, Labeebah; Testani, Jeffrey M.; Ugwuowo, Ugochukwu; Young, Patrick; Wilson, F.

Often, this path starts with innovation from academic collaborations amongst biologists, chemists, and engineers, followed by the formation of a start-up company driving clinical translation and approval. An early wave featured injectable (i.e., intramuscular, subcutaneous) biodegradable polymeric microspheres to control drug release profiles for peptides and small molecules (e.g., Lupron Depot®, Risperdal Consta®). With these early successes for microspheres, research shifted to exploring systemic delivery by intravenous injection, which required smaller particle sizes and modified surface properties (e.g., PEGylation) to enable long circulation times. These new innovations resulted in the nanoparticle medicines Doxil® and Abraxane®, designed to improve the therapeutic index of cytotoxic cancer agents by decreasing systemic exposure and delivering more drug to tumors. Very recently, the first siRNA lipid nanoparticle medicine, Patisiran (Onpattro®), was approved for treating hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis.

Since, there is an unprecedented global effort to develop a vaccine against the COVID-19 disease much less is known about its acceptance in the community. Understanding key determinants that influence the preferences and demands of a future vaccine by the community may help to develop strategies for improving the global vaccination program. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of the acceptancy of COVID-19 vaccine and their determinants among people in Saudi Arabia. Methods A web-based cross-sectional study was designed using snowball sampling strategies under a highly restricted environment. A bilingual self-administered anonymous questionnaire was designed and send to 1000 study participants through social media platforms and email. Study participants were recruited across the country, including the four major cities (Riyadh, Dammam, Jeddah, and Abha) in Saudi Arabia. Associations between COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and sociodemographic profile of the respondents were explored using the chi-squared test. Key determinants in predicting vaccine acceptancy among respondents were modelled using logistic regression analysis. Results Of the 1000 survey invitees 992 responded to the survey. The majority of the study participants (29.53%) were in the age group (36 to 45 years) and 65.8% were female and 17.9% were Non-Saudi participants. Of the 992 respondents 642 said they are interested in taking the COVID-19 vaccine once it is available. Willingness to accept a future COVID-19 vaccine is relatively high among older age groups (79.2% among 45+ year old), married participants (69.3%), participants with education levels of a postgraduate degree or higher (68.8%), non-Saudi (69.1%), workings with government sector (68.9%). In multivariate model, respondents who were above 45 years (aOR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.08-3.21), and married (aOR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.28-2.50) were significantly associated with vaccine acceptance (p < .05). Besides, people having trust in the health system were most likely to accept vaccination (aOR: 3.05; 95% CI: 1.13-4.92).Participants having a higher perceived risk of acquiring infection were 2.13 times higher odds of reporting their intention to uptake the COVID-19 vaccine (aOR: 2.13; 95% CI: 1.35-3.85).

For this reason, we designed a computer program using the yeast database genomic regions, and seeking two adjacent open reading frames separated only by a unique stop codon (called SORFs). Among the 58 SORFs identified, eight displayed a stop codon bypass level ranging from 3 to 25%. For each of the eight sequences, we demonstrated the presence of a poly(A) mRNA. Using isogenic [PSI(+)] and [psi(–)] yeast strains, we showed that for two of the sequences the mechanism used is a bona fide readthrough. However, the six remaining sequences were not sensitive to the PSI state, indicating either a translation termination process independent of eRF3 or a new stop codon bypass mechanism. Our results demonstrate that the presence of a stop codon in a large ORF may not always correspond to a sequencing error, or a pseudogene, but can be a recoding signal in a functional gene. This emphasizes that genome annotation should take into account the fact that recoding signals could be more frequently used than previously expected.",2003-05-01,"Namy, Olivier; Duchateau-Nguyen, Guillemette; Hatin, Isabelle; Hermann-Le Denmat, Sylvie; Termier, Michel; Rousset, Jean-Pierre",,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC154216/,

Copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), and zinc (Zn) were successfully deposited on the porous polymer, without prior surface preparation, to form coatings with thickness of about 400 µm. Coating surface morphology and cross-sections were examined using a scanning electron microscope. Individual metal splats on the porous and non-porous substrates were observed to study the differences in the bonding mechanisms. The adhesion strength and electrical resistivity of the coatings on porous PE were evaluated. It was found that the bond strength of all three metallic coatings was found to be higher than the ultimate fracture strength of the porous.

We find a positive correlation, faster spread of COVID-19 , with high confidence level with the following variables, with respective p-value: low Temperature (4x10 -7), high ratio of old vs. working-age people (3x10 -6), life expectancy (8x10 -6), number of international tourists (1x10 -5), earlier epidemic starting date (2x10 -5), high level of physical contact in greeting habits (6x10 -5), lung cancer prevalence (6x10 -5), obesity in males (1x10 -4), share of population in urban areas (2x10 -4), cancer prevalence (3x10 -4), alcohol consumption (0.0019), daily smoking prevalence (0.0036), UV index (0.004, smaller sample, 73 countries), low Vitamin D serum levels (0.002-0.006, smaller sample, 50 countries). There is highly significant correlation also with blood type: positive correlation with types RH- (2x10 -5) and A+ (2x10 -3), negative correlation with B+ (2x10 -4). We also find positive correlation with moderate confidence level (p-value of 0.02-0.03) with: CO2/SO emissions, type-1 diabetes in children, low vaccination coverage for Tuberculosis (BCG). Several of the above variables are correlated with each other and so they are likely to have common interpretations. Other variables are found to have a counterintuitive negative correlation, which may be explained due their strong negative correlation with life expectancy: slower spread of COVID-19 is correlated with high death-rate due to pollution, prevalence of anemia and hepatitis B, high blood pressure in females. We also analyzed the possible existence of a bias: countries with low GDP-per capita, typically located in warm regions, might have less intense testing and we discuss correlation with the above variables.",2020-05-12,"Notari, A.; Torrieri, G.",,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/1cfd77f38b7693fad2e244c790f819d620390ddd.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.20095083; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.08.20095083v1?rss=1,218538219.0
161898,8phva3kt,,WHO,"Neuropathological explanation of minimal COVID-19 infection rate in newborns, infants and children - a mystery so far. New insight into the role of Substance P",,,,unk,"Sars-Cov-2 or Novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has become a global challenge, affecting elderly population at large, causing a burden on hospitals. It has been affecting the world from a health and economic perspective after its emergence since October 2019 at Wuhan province of China. Later on it became a pandemic, with aged people most affected. Surprisingly, the infants and children were not severely infected and mortality among them was reported infrequently. If they died it was due to some comorbidity or congenital heart problems. Why the rate of infection varies in different age groups around the world and what is the protective mechanism in children remains a mystery. Based on our neuropathological experience at the ""Lino Rossi Research Center for the study and prevention of the unexpected perinatal death and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS)"" of the University of Milan, Italy, we hypothesize that the decreased severity of the disease in infants compared to the elderly may be due to alteration at neurotransmitter levels especially of the Substance P (SP) and of the spinal trigeminal nucleus in the brainstem that is responsible for its secretion. This neurotransmitter may be directly related to the respiratory illness as is in COVID-19 infection. It is responsible for the increased inflammation and the characteristic symptoms associated with this disease. It is the main switch that must be urgently turned off using the NK-1R antagonist which is the receptor of SP and responsible for its functionality, especially in the elderly.",2020,"Mehboob, Riffat; Lavezzi, Anna Maria",J Neurol Sci,,#997174,,,,,229306815.0

STUDY DESIGN The research investigated the elderly suicide rates of the 232 municipal units in South Korea between 2001 and 2011. METHODS The Gi* score, which is a spatially weighted indicator of area attributes, was used to identify hot spots and the spatiotemporal pattern of elderly suicide in the nation during the last 10 years. The spatial Markov matrix and spatial dynamic panel data model were employed to identify and estimate the diffusion effect. RESULTS The suicide rate among elderly individuals 75 years and older was substantially higher than the rate for those between 65 and 74 years of age; however, the spatial patterns of the suicide clusters were similar between the two groups. From 2001 to 2011, the spatial distribution of elderly suicide hot spots differed each year. For both age cohorts, elderly suicide hot spots developed around the north area of South Korea in 2001 and moved to the mid-east area and the mid-western coastal area over 10 years. The spatial Markov matrix indicates that the change in the suicide rate of one area was affected by the suicide rates of neighbouring areas from the previous year, which suggests that suicide increase in one area inflates a neighbouring area's suicide rate over time. Using a spatial dynamic panel data model, elderly suicide diffusion effects were found to be statistically significant for both age cohorts even after economic and demographic indicators and a time variable are included. For individuals 75 years and older, the diffusion effect appeared to be larger. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that elderly suicide can spread spatially over time in both age cohorts. Thus, it is necessary to design a place-based and age-differentiated intervention policy that precisely considers the spatial diffusion of elderly suicide.",2017,"Joo, Y",Public health,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2016.07.016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27613224/,876184.0

The goal of this study was to assess the effects of ventilation with low tidal volume (VT) either alone or in a combination with moderate permissive hypercapnia in major pancreatoduodenal interventions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixty adult patients scheduled for elective pancreatoduodenal surgery with duration >2 h were enrolled into a prospective single-center study. All patients were randomized to three groups receiving high VT [10 mL/kg of predicted body weight (PBW), the HVT group, n = 20], low VT (6 mL/kg PBW, the LVT group, n = 20), and low VT combined with a moderate hypercapnia and hypercapnic acidosis (6 mL/kg PBW, PaCO2 45-60 mm Hg, the LVT + HC group, n = 20). Cardiopulmonary parameters and the incidence of complications were registered during surgery and postoperatively. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The values of VT were 610 (563-712), 370 (321-400), and 340 (312-430) mL/kg for the HVT, the LVT, and the LVT + HC groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Compared to the HVT group, PaO2/FiO2 ratio was increased in the LVT group by 15%: 333 (301-381) vs. 382 (349-423) mm Hg at 24 h postoperatively (p < 0.05). The HVT group had significantly higher incidence of atelectases (n = 6), despite lower incidence of smoking compared with the LVT (n = 1) group (p = 0.017) and demonstrated longer length of hospital stay. The patients of the LVT + HC group had lower arterial lactate and bicarbonate excess values by the end of surgery. CONCLUSION In major pancreatoduodenal interventions, preventively protective VT improves postoperative oxygenation, reduces the incidence of atelectases, and shortens length of hospital stay. The combination of low VT and permissive hypercapnia results in hypercapnic acidosis decreasing the lactate concentration but adding no additional benefits and warrants further investigations.",2016,"Kuzkov, Vsevolod V; Rodionova, Ludmila N; Ilyina, Yana Y; Ushakov, Aleksey A; Sokolova, Maria M; Fot, Eugenia V; Duberman, Boris L; Kirov, Mikhail Y",Frontiers in medicine,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2016.00066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27999775/,16718334.0

However, microbial composition of the respiratory tract and other infected tissues, as well as their possible pathogenic contributions to varying degrees of disease severity in COVID-19 patients remain unclear. Method Between January 27 and February 26, 2020, serial clinical specimens (sputum, nasal and throat swab, anal swab and feces) were collected from a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, including 8 mildly and 15 severely ill patients (requiring ICU admission and mechanical ventilation), in the Guangdong province, China. Total RNA was extracted and ultra-deep metatranscriptomic sequencing was performed in combination with laboratory diagnostic assays. Co-infection rates, the prevalence and abundance of microbial communities in these COVID-19 patients were determined. Findings Notably, respiratory microbial co-infections were exclusively found in 84.6% of severely ill patients (11/13), among which viral and bacterial co-infections were detected by sequencing in 30.8% (4/13) and 69.2% (9/13) of the patients, respectively. In addition, for 23.1% (3/13) of the patients, bacterial co-infections with Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were also confirmed by bacterial culture. Further, a time-dependent, secondary infection of B. cenocepacia with expressions of multiple virulence genes in one severely ill patient was demonstrated, which might be the primary cause of his disease deterioration and death one month after ICU admission. Interpretation Our findings identified distinct patterns of co-infections with SARS-CoV-2 and various respiratory pathogenic microbes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in relation to disease severity. Detection and tracking of BCC-associated nosocomial infections are recommended to improve the pre-emptive treatment regimen and reduce fatal outcomes of hospitalized patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

We evaluated the immediate efficacy of an ultrasonic energy vessel-sealing device for sealing PA branches and compared it with the gold standard (endostapler) in an ex vivo model. METHODS This was a prospective cohort study. Immediately after anatomical lung resection, PA vessel sealing was achieved using the HARMONIC ACE+ Shears (ACE; Ethicon, Cincinnati, OH) sealing device or a vascular endostapler (VES) in a 3:1 ratio based on vessel diameter. The vessel was slowly pressurized, and the bursting pressure was recorded. RESULTS A total of 137 PA branches were sealed in specimens from 43 patients, of which 90 vessels were sealed with ACE and 47 were sealed with VES. The mean PA branch diameter was 6.0 mm (range, 1.7 mm to 24.0 mm; standard deviation, 3.1 mm Hg). The mean bursting pressure was 333.0 mm Hg (range, 84.0 mm Hg to 1415.1 mm Hg; standard deviation, 231.4 mm Hg) in the ACE group and 114.2 mm Hg (range, 0 mm Hg to 840.0 mm Hg; standard deviation, 124.7) in the VES group (p < 0.001).

METHOD: Prospective, multicenter, observational study, in 19 pediatric intensive care units. Patients aged 1 month to 19 years admitted consecutively (March–May 2020) were included. Demographic, clinical-epidemiological features, treatment, and outcomes were collected. Subgroups were compared according to comorbidities, age < 1 year, and need for invasive mechanical ventilation. A multivariable logistic regression model was used for predictors of severity. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were included (ten with multisystemic inflammatory syndrome). Median age 4 years; 54% male (multisystemic inflammatory syndrome, 80%); 41% had comorbidities (multisystemic inflammatory syndrome, 20%). Fever (76%), cough (51%), and tachypnea (50%) were common in both groups. Severe symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, and higher inflammatory markers were more frequent in multisystemic inflammatory syndrome. Interstitial lung infiltrates were common in both groups, but pleural effusion was more prevalent in the multisystemic inflammatory syndrome group (43% vs. 14%). Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in 18% (median 7.5 days); antibiotics, oseltamivir, and corticosteroids were used in 76%, 43%, and 23%, respectively, but not hydroxychloroquine. The median pediatric intensive care unit length-of-stay was five days; there were two deaths (3%) in the non- multisystemic inflammatory syndrome group. Patients with comorbidities were older, and comorbidities were independently associated with the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 5.5; 95% CI, 1.43–21.12; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In Brazilian pediatric intensive care units, COVID-19 had low mortality, age less than 1 year was not associated with a worse prognosis, and patients with multisystemic inflammatory syndrome had more severe symptoms, higher inflammatory biomarkers, and a greater predominance of males, but only comorbidities and chronic diseases were independent predictors of severity.",2020-08-04,"Prata-Barbosa, Arnaldo; Lima-Setta, Fernanda; Santos, Gustavo Rodrigues dos; Lanziotti, Vanessa Soares; de Castro, Roberta Esteves Vieira; de Souza, Daniela Carla; Raymundo, Carlos Eduardo; de Oliveira, Felipe Rezende Caino; de Lima, Lucio Flavio Peixoto; Tonial, Cristian Tedesco; Colleti, José; Bellinat, Ana Paula Novaes; Lorenzo, Vivian Botelho; Zeitel, Raquel de Seixas; Pulcheri, Lucas; Costa, Fernanda Ciuffo Monte da; La Torre, Fabíola Peixoto Ferreira; Figueiredo, Elaine Augusta das Neves; Silva, Thiago Peres da; Riveiro, Paula Marins; Mota, Isabele Coelho Fonseca da; Brandão, Igor Bromonschenkel; de Azevedo, Zina Maria Almeida; Gregory, Simone Camera; Boedo, Fernanda Raquel Oliveira; de Carvalho, Rosana Novais; Castro, Natália Almeida de Arnaldo Silva Rodriguez; Genu, Daniel Hilário Santos; Foronda, Flavia Andrea Krepel; Cunha, Antonio José Ledo A.; de Magalhães-Barbosa, Maria Clara",J Pediatr (Rio J),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/bafe70e94c28349fd06fd3f6cec430210b6e06bf.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7402103.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021755720301923?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32781034/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jped.2020.07.002; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021755720301923,220962749.0

However, there is limited data on the clinical characteristics, stroke mechanism, and outcomes of patients who have a stroke and COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients with ischemic stroke who were hospitalized between March 15, 2020, and April 19, 2020, within a major health system in New York, the current global epicenter of the pandemic. We compared the clinical characteristics of stroke patients with a concurrent diagnosis of COVID-19 to stroke patients without COVID-19 (contemporary controls). In addition, we compared patients to a historical cohort of patients with ischemic stroke discharged from our hospital system between March 15, 2019, and April 15, 2019 (historical controls). RESULTS: During the study period in 2020, out of 3556 hospitalized patients with diagnosis of COVID-19 infection, 32 patients (0.9%) had imaging proven ischemic stroke. Cryptogenic stroke was more common in patients with COVID-19 (65.6%) as compared to contemporary controls (30.4%, P=0.003) and historical controls (25.0%, P<0.001). When compared with contemporary controls, COVID-19 positive patients had higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and higher peak D-dimer levels. When compared with historical controls, COVID-19 positive patients were more likely to be younger men with elevated troponin, higher admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Patients with COVID-19 and stroke had significantly higher mortality than historical and contemporary controls. CONCLUSIONS: We observed a low rate of imaging-confirmed ischemic stroke in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

METHODS: We prospectively assessed the medical records, laboratory results, chest CT images and use of medication in a cohort of patients presenting to two designated covid-19 treatment centres in Sichuan, China. Outcomes of interest included death, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), need for mechanical ventilation, treatment with vasoactive agents and classification of disease severity. Acute myocardial injury was defined by a value of high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) greater than the normal upper limit. RESULTS: A total of 101 cases were enrolled from January to 10 March 2020 (average age 49 years, IQR 34-62 years). Acute myocardial injury was present in 15.8% of patients, nearly half of whom had a hs-TnT value fivefold greater than the normal upper limit. Patients with acute myocardial injury were older, with a higher prevalence of pre-existing cardiovascular disease and more likely to require ICU admission (62.5% vs 24.7%, p=0.003), mechanical ventilation (43.5% vs 4.7%, p<0.001) and treatment with vasoactive agents (31.2% vs 0%, p<0.001).

Traditional Chinese herbal medicine (TCM) has been used effectively to combat each of these epidemics’ infections, and saved many lives. To date, there are hundreds of herbal TCM formulae developed for the purpose of prevention and treatment during epidemic infections. When COVID-19 ravaged the Wuhan district in China in early January 2020, without a deep understanding about the nature of COVID-19, patients admitted to the TCM Hospital in Wuhan were immediately treated with TCM and reported later with >90% efficacy. APPROACH: : We conducted conduct a systematic survey of various TCM herbal preparations used in Wuhan and to review their efficacy, according to the published clinical data; and, secondly, to find the most popular herbs used in these preparations and look into the opportunity of future research in the isolation and identification of bioactive natural products for fighting COVID-19. RESULTS: : Although bioactive natural products in these herbal preparations may have direct antiviral activities, TCM employed for fighting epidemic infections was primarily based on the TCM theory of restoring the balance of the human immune system, thereby defeating the viral infection indirectly. In addition, certain TCM teachings relevant to the meridian system deserve better attention. For instance, many TCM herbal preparations target the lung meridian, which connects the lung and large intestine. This interconnection between the lung, including the upper respiratory system, and the intestine, may explain why certain TCM formulae showed excellent relief of lung congestion and diarrhea, two characteristics of COVID-19 infection.

HDAC6 deficient mice and a specific HDAC6 inhibitor were utilized in our studies. Our data clearly indicate that HDAC6 is an important mediator of NO production in macrophages. HDAC6 mediates NO production through the regulation of iNOS expression in macrophages. HDAC6 up-regulates iNOS expression in macrophages by modulating STAT1 activation and IRF-1 expression. HDAC6 inhibition potently blocked endotoxin-induced STAT1 activation and iNOS expression in macrophages. Furthermore, HDAC6 contributes to excessive NO production and nitrotyrosine level in the blood and promotes iNOS expression in the lung tissues during septic shock.

Compared with placebo (or no ESA), ESA therapy was associated with a substantial reduction in mortality [risk ratio (RR) 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49-0.79, P = 0.0001, I = 0%). In patients with traumatic brain injury, ESA therapy did not increase the number of patients surviving with moderate disability or good recovery (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88-1.15, P = 0.95, I = 0%). With the dosing regimens employed in the included studies, ESA therapy did not increase the risk of lower limb proximal deep venous thrombosis (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.72-1.29, P = 0.78, I = 0%). CONCLUSIONS The administration of ESAs to critically ill trauma patients is associated with a significant improvement in mortality without an increase in the rate of lower limb proximal deep venous thrombosis.

Quantitative information about TCM prescriptions, constituent herbs and herbal ingredients is necessary for studying and exploring TCM. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH We manually collected information on TCM in books and other printed sources in Medline. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Information Database TCM-ID, at http://tcm.cz3.nus.edu.sg/group/tcm-id/tcmid.asp, was introduced for providing comprehensive information about all aspects of TCM including prescriptions, constituent herbs, herbal ingredients, molecular structure and functional properties of active ingredients, therapeutic and side effects, clinical indication and application and related matters. RESULTS TCM-ID currently contains information for 1,588 prescriptions, 1,313 herbs, 5,669 herbal ingredients, and the 3D structure of 3,725 herbal ingredients. The value of the data in TCM-ID was illustrated by using some of the data for an in-silico study of molecular mechanism of the therapeutic effects of herbal ingredients and for developing a computer program to validate TCM multi-herb preparations. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The development of systems biology has led to a new design principle for therapeutic intervention strategy, the concept of 'magic shrapnel' (rather than the 'magic bullet'), involving many drugs against multiple targets, administered in a single treatment. TCM offers an extensive source of examples of this concept in which several active ingredients in one prescription are aimed at numerous targets and work together to provide therapeutic benefit. The database and its mining applications described here represent early efforts toward exploring TCM for new theories in drug discovery.",2006,"Chen, X; Zhou, H; Liu, Y B; Wang, J F; Li, H; Ung, C Y; Han, L Y; Cao, Z W; Chen, Y Z",British journal of pharmacology,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17088869/,13493590.0

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are an important target group for vaccination against influenza due to their increased risk of infection and their potential to transmit the infection to their patients, families and communities. The aim of this study was to assess the potential hesitancy and its associated factors towards influenza vaccination amongst HCWs in the South Al Batinah governorate in Oman. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 390 HCWs with direct or indirect patient contact was conducted in May and June 2019 using a self-administered questionnaire. Associations between HCW characteristics and vaccination status were examined using bivariate and multivariate analyses to identify the likelihood of vaccination against seasonal influenza among HCWs. Results: Overall, 60% of HCWs were vaccinated in the 2018/2019 season; vaccine uptake among nurses was 52% and uptake was higher among women. Self-protection and protection of the community were the most cited reasons for vaccine acceptance, with side effects being the main reason for hesitancy. Vaccinated respondents had a higher mean knowledge score (7.18; standard deviation SD: 2.14) than unvaccinated respondents (6.30; SD: 2.2). Odds of vaccination were highest among respondents who believed influenza vaccine should be mandatory for HCWs (Odds ratio (OR): 2.04 [1.30–3.18]), those working in the general medicine, emergency medicine, or intensive care units (OR: 1.92 [1.20–3.10]), nurses and doctors (OR: 1.75 [1.09–2.79]) and those who believe that HCWs should receive an influenza vaccine (OR: 1.35 [1.07–2.77]).

The Neotropical region harbors a considerable diversity of avian species that may play a role as both host and short-distance vectors of unknown viruses. Viral metagenomics of cloacal swabs from 50 Neotropical birds collected in French Guiana revealed the presence of four complete astrovirus genomes. They constitute an early diverging novel monophyletic clade within the Avastrovirus phylogeny, representing a putative new astrovirus species (provisionally designated as Avastrovirus 5) according to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) classification criteria. Their genomic organization shares some characteristics with Avastrovirus but also with Mamastrovirus. The pan-astrovirus RT-PCR analysis of the cloacal samples of 406 wild Neotropical birds showed a community-level prevalence of 4.9% (5.1% in passerines, the highest described so far in this order of birds). By screening birds of a remote region, we expanded the known host range of astroviruses to the avian families Cardinalidae, Conopophagidae, Furnariidae, Thamnophilidae, Turdidae and Tyrannidae.

271456,xwuaj1hz,,WHO,Reintegrating droperidol into emergency medicine practice,,,,unk,"PURPOSE: After a long period of low utilization, droperidol has become easier to obtain in the US market. This comprehensive review discusses the safety, indications, clinical efficacy, and dosing of droperidol for use in the emergency department (ED) setting. SUMMARY: In 2001 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated a boxed warning in the labeling of droperidol after reports of QT interval prolongation associated with droperidol use. Since that time, it has been difficult to access droperidol in the United States; as a result, many practicing clinicians lack experience in its clinical use. Multiple studies have been conducted to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of droperidol use in ED patients. Results consistently show the safety of droperidol and its clinical efficacy when used as an analgesic, antiemetic, and sedative. Now that droperidol is more widely available for use in the US market, pharmacists and prescribers need to reliably translate safety and efficacy data compiled since 2001 to help ensure appropriate and effective use of the medication. CONCLUSION: Droperidol is an effective and safe option for the treatment of acute agitation, migraine, nausea, and pain for patients in the ED setting. Healthcare professionals can adopt droperidol for use in clinical practice, and they should become familiar with how to dose and monitor droperidol for safe and effective use.",2020,"Mattson, Alicia; Friend, Kimberly; Brown, Caitlin S; Cabrera, Daniel",Am. j. health system pharm,,#32839811,,,,,221308100.0

To date, little evidence is available about the effect of lockdown release in terms of adolescent health from the perspective of an emergency department (ED). METHODS: We reviewed data on ED arrivals of adolescents and young adults (aged 13–24 years) in the weeks immediately before and after the Italian lockdown release in 2020, and in the same periods in 2019, with a focus on cases of severe alcohol abuse, psychomotor agitation, and other mental issues. RESULTS: The relative frequency of severe alcohol intoxications increased from .88% during the last part of the lockdown to 11.3% after lockdown release. When comparing these data with the same period in 2019, a highly significant difference emerged, with severe alcohol intoxications accounting for 11.31% of ED visits versus 2.96%, respectively. The relative frequency of ED arrivals related to psychomotor agitation or other mental health issues was not significantly increased after lockdown release.

When the permissive temperature is reinstated, ts045 G forms an oligomer and moves to the Golgi.

In many countries, use of vaccines is restricted due to limitations of subunit vaccines with regard to efficacy and onset of protection as well as failure of live vaccines to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA principle). Chimeric pestiviruses based on CSF virus (CSFV) and the related bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) have been licensed as live marker vaccines in Europe and Asia, but cross-reactive antibodies can cause problems in DIVA application due to close antigenic relationship. To develop marker vaccine candidates with improved DIVA properties, three chimeric viruses were generated by replacing Erns of CSFV Alfort-Tübingen with homologue proteins of only distantly related pestiviruses. The chimeric viruses ""Ra"", ""Pro"", and ""RaPro"" contained Erns sequences of Norway rat and Pronghorn pestiviruses or a combination of both, respectively. In porcine cells, the ""Pro"" chimera replicated to high titers, while replication of the ""Ra"" chimera was limited. The ""RaPro"" chimera showed an intermediate phenotype. All vaccine candidates were attenuated in a vaccination/ challenge trial in pigs, but to different extents. Inoculation induced moderate to high levels of neutralizing antibodies that protected against infection with a genetically heterologous, highly virulent CSFV. Importantly, serum samples of vaccinated animals did not show any cross-reactivity in a CSFV Erns antibody ELISA. In conclusion, the Erns antigen from distantly related pestiviruses can provide a robust serological negative marker for a new generation of improved CSFV marker vaccines based on the chimeric pestivirus concept.",2020,"Postel, Alexander; Becher, Paul",Emerg Microbes Infect,,#32962557,,,,,221865458.0

Conceptually we take our cue from Norbert Elias and the way something as physiologically fundamental as coughing becomes the focus of etiquette and technique, touching also on themes central to Mary Douglas’ anthropology of pollution. This is explored through four themes. First, we show how coughing becomes a matter of biopolitical citizenship expressed through etiquettes that also displace pollution anxieties to surroundings. Second, coughing is a question of being assisted to cough through the mediation of professional skills, interventions and devices.

The aim was to assess the short- and mid-term results of robot-assisted thoracoscopic oesophagectomy for oesophageal cancer. METHODS Between October 2003 and May 2007, 47 patients with resectable oesophageal cancer underwent robot-assisted thoracoscopic oesophagectomy. Clinical data were collected prospectively. RESULTS Conversion to thoracotomy was necessary in seven patients. Median operating time was 450 min and median blood loss 625 ml. Median postoperative ventilation time was 1 day, intensive care stay 3 days and hospital stay 18 days. Twenty-one of 47 patients had pulmonary complications. Three patients died in hospital. A median of 29 (range 8-68) lymph nodes was dissected and R0 resection was achieved in 36 patients. Twenty-three patients had stage IVa disease. After a median follow-up of 35 months, median disease-free survival was 15 (95 per cent confidence interval 12 to 18) months.

However, the exact mechanism has been unknown. To assess the effectiveness of skeletal muscles in reducing neuronal injury after the initial damage owing to cardiac arrest, we investigated the relationship between estimated lean body mass (LBM) and the prognosis of postcardiac arrest patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with ROSC after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from January 2015 to March 2020. The enrolled patients were allocated into good- and poor-outcome groups (cerebral performance category (CPC) scores 1–2 and 3–5, respectively). Estimated LBM was categorized into quartiles. Multivariate regression models were used to evaluate the association between LBM and a good CPC score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was assessed. Results: In total, 155 patients were analyzed (CPC score 1–2 vs. 3–5, n = 70 vs. n = 85). Patients’ age, first monitored rhythm, no-flow time, presumed cause of arrest, BMI, and LBM were different (p < 0.05). Fourth-quartile LBM (≥48.98 kg) was associated with good neurological outcome of postcardiac arrest patients (odds ratio = 4.81, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.10–25.55, p = 0.04).

Further research is required to halt progression of multi-organ injury induced by hyper-inflammation. AREAS COVERED: PubMed/MEDLINETM databases were accessed between May 9th-June 9th, 2020, to review the latest perspectives on the treatment and pathogenesis of CRS. EXPERT OPINION: Over-activity of chemotaxis triggers a macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) resulting in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. IL-6 and TNF- &#945; are at the forefront of hyper-inflammation. The inflammatory cascade induces endothelial activation and capillary leak, leading to circulatory collapse and shock. As endothelial dysfunction persists, there is activation of the clotting cascade and microvascular obstruction. Continued endothelial activation results in multi-organ failure, regardless of pulmonary tissue damage. We propose that targeting the endothelium may interrupt this cycle. Immuno-modulating therapies have been suggested, however, further data is necessary to confirm that they do not jeopardize adaptive immunity. Inhibition of IL-6 and the Janus Kinase, signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins pathway (JAK/STAT), are favorable targets. Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) reduces the inflammation of sepsis in animal models and should be considered as a low risk intervention, in combination with cardiovascular protection.",2020,"Pearce, Lucie; Davidson, Sean M; Yellon, Derek M",Expert Opin Ther Targets,,#620479,,,,,220258289.0

We here examine how the presence of direct purifying selection and background selection may bias demographic inference by evaluating two commonly-used methods (MSMC and fastsimcoal2), specifically studying how the underlying shape of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) and the fraction of directly selected sites interact with demographic parameter estimation. The results show that, even after masking functional genomic regions, background selection may cause the mis-inference of population growth under models of both constant population size and decline. This effect is amplified as the strength of purifying selection and the density of directly selected sites increases, as indicated by the distortion of the site frequency spectrum and levels of nucleotide diversity at linked neutral sites. We also show how simulated changes in background selection effects caused by population size changes can be predicted analytically. We propose a potential method for correcting for the mis-inference of population growth caused by selection. By treating the DFE as a nuisance parameter and averaging across all potential realizations, we demonstrate that even directly selected sites can be used to infer demographic histories with reasonable accuracy.",2021-01-18,"Johri, Parul; Riall, Kellen; Becher, Hannes; Excoffier, Laurent; Charlesworth, Brian; Jensen, Jeffrey D.",bioRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/1c3859b750cac8603482ad5759803c3f4894a529.json; document_parses/pdf_json/79db94850d598c6ee2afe2e5f71e54ca969c736a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7836109.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.066365,218530393.0

Open repair of AAA involves lengthy surgery time, anesthesia, and substantial recovery time. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) provides a safer option for patients with advanced age and pulmonary, cardiac, and renal dysfunction. Successful endovascular repair of AAA depends on correct selection of patients (on the basis of their vascular anatomy), choice of the correct endoprosthesis, and familiarity with the technique and procedure-specific complications. The type of aneurysm is defined by its location with respect to the renal arteries, whether it is a true or false aneurysm, and whether the common iliac arteries are involved. Vascular anatomy can be divided more technically into aortic neck, aortic aneurysm, pelvic perfusion, and iliac morphology, with grades of difficulty with respect to EVAR, aortic neck morphology being the most common factor to affect EVAR appropriateness. When choosing among the devices available on the market, one must consider the patient's vascular anatomy and choose between devices that provide suprarenal fixation versus those that provide infrarenal fixation. A successful technique can be divided into preprocedural imaging, ancillary procedures before AAA stent-graft placement, the procedure itself, postprocedural medical therapy, and postprocedural imaging surveillance. Imaging surveillance is important in assessing complications such as limb thrombosis, endoleaks, graft migration, enlargement of the aneurysm sac, and rupture.

Using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), children and parents were separately questioned about QOL of patients. RESULTS: The mean patients' age was 8.6 ± 3.2 years (SD), with range of 5-16 years. The children responded that all PedsQL scores were significantly improved by surgery, and the highest improvement was observed in the school subscale score. When the parents rated the children's QOL, significant improvements were limited to 3 out of 7 subscales, including the emotional, psychosocial health summary, and total scores. The improvements in the PedsQL score were not correlated with age, size of deviation changes following surgery, nor the improvement in binocular vision. CONCLUSIONS: The general health-related QOL significantly improved by surgery in pediatric patients with IXT, while the improvement was considerably underestimated by the parents.

As patient involvement is indispensable in driving changes to clinical practice, Europa Donna the European patient advocacy group was closely involved in the 12th manifesto. Reimbursement policies have rarely evolved with advances in breast cancer care such as outpatient (ambulatory) care rather than inpatient admission, use of oral or subcutaneous anti-cancer drugs rather than day-hospital intravenous administration, oncoplastic surgery techniques to minimize mastectomy rates, breast reconstructive surgery, risk-reducing surgery for BRCA mutation carriers, or use of hypo-fractionated breast radiation therapy. Although each European country, region and centre will have to understand how their reimbursement policies may hinder best care and find their own solutions, the problems are similar throughout Europe and some solutions can be broadly applied.

This algorithm can obtain new and relevant information from extremely limited and poor datasets. In a world dominated by the concept of big (fat?) data we want to show that it is possible, by necessity or choice, to work profitably even on small data. This peculiarity of the algorithm means that even in the early stages of an epidemic process, when the data are too few to have sufficient statistics, it is possible to obtain important information. To prove our theory, we addressed one of the most central issues at the moment: the COVID-19 epidemic. In particular, the cases recorded in Italy have been selected. Italy seems to have a central role in this epidemic because of the high number of measured infections. Through this innovative artificial intelligence algorithm, we have tried to analyze the evolution of the phenomenon and to predict its future steps using a dataset that contained only geospatial coordinates (longitude and latitude) of the first recorded cases. Once the coordinates of the places where at least one case of contagion had been officially diagnosed until February 26(th), 2020 had been collected, research and analysis was carried out on: outbreak point and related heat map (TWC alpha); probability distribution of the contagion on February 26th (TWC beta); possible spread of the phenomenon in the immediate future and then in the future of the future (TWC gamma and TWC theta); how this passage occurred in terms of paths and mutual influence (Theta paths and Markov Machine).

D-dimer elevation is particularly frequent, and values higher than 1µg/mL have been associated with disease severity and in-hospital mortality. Previous retrospective studies found a high pulmonary embolism (PE) prevalence, however, it should be highlighted that diagnoses were only completed when PE was clinically suspected. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Single-center prospective cohort study. Between April 6th and April 17th 2020, consecutive confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia with D-dimer >1 µg/mL underwent computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) to investigate the presence and magnitude of PE. Demographic and laboratory data, comorbidities, CTPA scores, administered treatments, and, clinical outcomes were analysed and compared between patients with and without PE. RESULTS: Thirty consecutive patients (11 women) were included. PE was diagnosed in 15 patients (50%). In patients with PE, emboli were located mainly in segmental arteries (86%) and bilaterally (60%). Patients with PE were significantly older (median age 67.0 (IQR 63.0-73.0) vs. 57.0 (IQR 48.0-69.0) years, p = .048) and did not differ in sex or risk factors for thromboembolic disease from the non-PE group. D-dimer, platelet count, and, C reactive protein values were significantly higher among PE patients. D-dimer values correlated with the radiologic magnitude of PE (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and D-dimer values higher than 1 µg/mL presented a high prevalence of PE, regardless of clinical suspicion.

We reviewed a consecutive series of spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas referred to our institution that were missed or misdiagnosed on initial imaging and studied the clinical consequences of missing or misdiagnosing the lesion. MATERIALS AND METHODS We reviewed spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas diagnosed at our institution between January 1, 2000, and November 1, 2014. A lesion was defined as ""misdiagnosed"" if initial MR imaging or CT myelography demonstrated characteristic imaging features of spinal dural arteriovenous fistula but the patient was clinically or radiologically misdiagnosed. Outcomes included length of delay of diagnosis, increased disability (increase in mRS or Aminoff motor disability of ≥1 point) between initial imaging evaluation and diagnosis date, and posttreatment disability. RESULTS Fifty-three consecutive spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas that were initially misdiagnosed despite having characteristic imaging findings on MR imaging or CT myelography were included in our study. Eight patients (18.9%) underwent spinal angiography before referral, which was interpreted as having negative findings but was either incomplete (6 cases) or retrospectively demonstrated the spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas (2 cases). The median time of delayed diagnosis was 6 months (interquartile range, 2-14 months). Fifty-one patients (96.2%) had increased disability between the initial study, which demonstrated features of a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula, and diagnosis. Thirty-two patients (60.4%) developed a new requirement for a walker or wheelchair. Following treatment, 21 patients (41.2%) had an improvement of 1 point on the mRS or Aminoff motor disability scale.

The polymorphic rhoptry protein 18 (ROP18) is a key serine (Ser)/threonine (Thr) kinase that phosphorylates host proteins to modulate acute virulence. However, the basis of neurotropism and the specific substrates through which ROP18 exerts neuropathogenesis remain unknown. Using mass spectrometry, we performed proteomic analysis of proteins that selectively bind to active ROP18 and identified RTN1-C, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that is preferentially expressed in the CNS. We demonstrated that ROP18 is associated with the N-terminal portion of RTN1-C and specifically phosphorylates RTN1-C at Ser7/134 and Thr4/8/118. ROP18 phosphorylation of RTN1-C triggers ER stress-mediated apoptosis in neural cells. Remarkably, ROP18 phosphorylation of RTN1-C enhances glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) acetylation by attenuating the activity of histone deacetylase (HDAC), and this event is associated with an increase of neural apoptosis.

Non-replicating Ad vectors possess several attributes which make them attractive vaccines for infectious disease, including their capacity for high titer growth, ease of manipulation, safety, and immunogenicity in clinical studies, as well as their compatibility with clinical manufacturing and thermo-stabilization procedures. In general, Ad vectors are immunogenic vaccines, which elicit robust transgene antigen-specific cellular (namely CD8(+) T cells) and/or humoral immune responses. A large number of adenoviruses isolated from humans and non-human primates, which have low seroprevalence in humans, have been vectorized and tested as vaccines in animal models and humans. However, a distinct hierarchy of immunological potency has been identified between diverse Ad vectors, which unfortunately limits the potential use of many vectors which have otherwise desirable manufacturing characteristics. The precise mechanistic factors which underlie the profound disparities in immunogenicity are not clearly defined and are the subject of ongoing, detailed investigation. It has been suggested that a combination of factors contribute to the potent immunogenicity of particular Ad vectors, including the magnitude and duration of vaccine antigen expression following immunization. Furthermore, the excessive induction of Type I interferons by some Ad vectors has been suggested to impair transgene expression levels, dampening subsequent immune responses. Therefore, the induction of balanced, but not excessive stimulation of innate signaling is optimal. Entry factor binding or receptor usage of distinct Ad vectors can also affect their in vivo tropism following administration by different routes. The abundance and accessibility of innate immune cells and/or antigen-presenting cells at the site of injection contributes to early innate immune responses to Ad vaccination, affecting the outcome of the adaptive immune response. Although a significant amount of information exists regarding the tropism determinants of the common human adenovirus type-5 vector, very little is known about the receptor usage and tropism of rare species or non-human Ad vectors. Increased understanding of how different facets of the host response to Ad vectors contribute to their immunological potency will be essential for the development of optimized and customized Ad vaccine platforms for specific diseases.",2020-05-19,"Coughlan, Lynda",Front Immunol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/31e8e86a9f6a489004a69ef7345ba9199669a07f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7248264.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.00909; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32508823/,218676365.0

This data allow the design of secondary analyses that take advantage of this information to create new knowledge. One of these feasible analyses is the evaluation of the expression level for a gene through a series of different conditions or cell types. Based on this idea, we have developed Automatic and Serial Analysis of CO-expression, which performs expression profiles for a given gene along hundreds of heterogeneous and normalized transcriptomics experiments and discover other genes that show either a similar or an inverse behavior. It might help to discover co-regulated genes, and common transcriptional regulators in any biological model. The present severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is an opportunity to test this novel approach due to the wealth of data that are being generated, which could be used for validating results. Thus, we have identified 35 host factors in the literature putatively involved in the infectious cycle of SARS-CoV viruses and searched for genes tightly co-expressed with them. We have found 1899 co-expressed genes whose assigned functions are strongly related to viral cycles. Moreover, this set of genes heavily overlaps with those identified by former laboratory high-throughput screenings (with P-value near 0).

RESULTS: Five studies were included. Wearing RPDs exerted significant respiratory effects, including increased breathing resistance, CO(2) rebreathing due to CO(2) accumulation in the RPD cavity, and decreased inhaled O(2) concentration. We discussed the implications of these effects on the respiratory pathophysiology of panic. LIMITATIONS: Most studies had a small sample size, with a preponderance of young participants. Different methodologies were used across the studies. Furthermore, differences in physical responses between wearing RPDs in experimental settings or daily life cannot be excluded.

As the virus infected cases and mortality rate of this disease is increasing exponentially, scientists and researchers all over the world are relentlessly working to understand this new virus along with possible treatment regimens by discovering active therapeutic agents and vaccines. So, there is an urgent requirement of new and effective medications that can treat the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We perform the study of drugs that are already available in the market and being used for other diseases to accelerate clinical recovery, in other words repurposing of existing drugs. The vast complexity in drug design and protocols regarding clinical trials often prohibit developing various new drug combinations for this epidemic disease in a limited time. Recently, remarkable improvements in computational power coupled with advancements in Machine Learning (ML) technology have been utilized to revolutionize the drug development process. Consequently, a detailed study using ML for the repurposing of therapeutic agents is urgently required. Here, we report the ML model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm, which has an accuracy of around 73% to predict the drugs that could be used for the treatment of COVID-19. Our study predicts around ten FDA approved commercial drugs that can be used for repurposing. Among all, we found that 3 of the drugs fulfils the criterions well among which the antiretroviral drug Amprenavir (DrugBank ID-DB00701) would probably be the most effective drug based on the selected criterions.

Prehospital airway management strategies were classified as extraglottic device placement, endotracheal intubation, bag-valve mask ventilation (BVM), or lack of a prehospital airway with subsequent intubation at the trauma center. Patients were excluded if they were hospital transfers, were dead on arrival, died in the emergency department, or did not require at least 48 hours of mechanical ventilation. The primary end point was the development of VAP as determined by institutional guidelines for diagnosis. Logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for VAP.

Ninety-seven patients (30.6%) developed VAP. Prehospital airway strategies were as follows: 17 (5.4%) had extraglottic device placement, 28 (8.8%) had BVM, 84 (26.5%) had endotracheal intubation, and 188 (59.3%) had no prehospital airway placement and were intubated after arrival. The type of prehospital airway was not statistically significant in terms of VAP development (range, 26.1-42.9%; p = 0.15). The only statistically significant predictor of VAP was length of mechanical ventilation (univariate: odds ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.18; p ≤ 0.01; multivariate: odds ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.20; p ≤ 0.01). CONCLUSION Our data suggest that the prehospital airway device used was not associated with the development of VAP.

Symptomatic adult congenital Bochdalek hernia, on the other hand, is extremely rare with a prevalence of 0.17-6% of all diaphragmatic hernias. They present with recurrent abdominal pain and shortness of breath. Acute presentations could be life threatening especially if there is incarcerated or threatened bowel in the chest. Repair of symptomatic Bochdalek hernia is recommended in the adult population. We present two cases of right and left symptomatic Bochdalek hernias in adults, encountered over 15 years of practice in a tertiary referral centre in the UK. We discuss their presentation and surgical management and review the literature of similar cases treated by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Thoracic surgeons are increasingly becoming involved in these cases, which used to be the domain of upper gastrointestinal surgeons. A synthetic patch may be required to close the defect, therefore; the thoracic surgeon must be familiar with such techniques. The recent expansion in video format publishing in the internet and social media has revolutionized the way knowledge and how-to-do-it expertise is distributed around the world. It has the advantage of reaching far more viewer than subscription paper-printed format journals and has a rising significance in encouraging thoracic surgeons to do things they were not used to do.

It remains unclear to what extent the treatment-related reduction in follow-up infarct volume (FIV) explains the improved functional outcome after EVT in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Objective To study whether FIV mediates the relationship between EVT and functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Design, Setting, and Participants Patient data from 7 randomized multicenter trials were pooled. These trials were conducted between December 2010 and April 2015 and included 1764 patients randomly assigned to receive either EVT or standard care (control). Follow-up infarct volume was assessed on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging after stroke onset. Mediation analysis was performed to examine the potential causal chain in which FIV may mediate the relationship between EVT and functional outcome. A total of 1690 patients met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-five additional patients were excluded, resulting in a total of 1665 patients, including 821 (49.3%) in the EVT group and 844 (50.7%) in the control group. Data were analyzed from January to June 2017. Main Outcome and Measure The 90-day functional outcome via the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Results Among 1665 patients, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 68 (57-76) years, and 781 (46.9%) were female. The median (IQR) time to FIV measurement was 30 (24-237) hours. The median (IQR) FIV was 41 (14-120) mL. Patients in the EVT group had significantly smaller FIVs compared with patients in the control group (median [IQR] FIV, 33 [11-99] vs 51 [18-134] mL; P = .007) and lower mRS scores at 90 days (median [IQR] score, 3 [1-4] vs 4 [2-5]). Follow-up infarct volume was a predictor of functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.39-0.54; P < .001). Follow-up infarct volume partially mediated the relationship between treatment type with mRS score, as EVT was still significantly associated with functional outcome after adjustment for FIV (adjusted common odds ratio, 2.22; 95% CI, 1.52-3.21; P < .001). Treatment-reduced FIV explained 12% (95% CI, 1-19) of the relationship between EVT and functional outcome. Conclusions and Relevance In this analysis, follow-up infarct volume predicted functional outcome; however, a reduced infarct volume after treatment with EVT only explained 12% of the treatment benefit. Follow-up infarct volume as measured on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is not a valid proxy for estimating treatment effect in phase II and III trials of acute ischemic stroke.",2019,"Boers, Anna M M; Jansen, Ivo G H; Brown, Scott; Lingsma, Hester F; Beenen, Ludo F M; Devlin, Thomas G; Román, Luis San; Heo, Ji-Hoe; Ribó, Marc; Almekhlafi, Mohammed A; Liebeskind, David S; Teitelbaum, Jeanne; Cuadras, Patricia; du Mesnil de Rochemont, Richard; Beaumont, Marine; Brown, Martin M; Yoo, Albert J; Donnan, Geoffrey A; Mas, Jean Louis; Oppenheim, Catherine; Dowling, Richard J; Moulin, Thierry; Agrinier, Nelly; Lopes, Demetrius K; Aja Rodríguez, Lucía; Compagne, Kars C J; Al-Ajlan, Fahad S; Madigan, Jeremy; Albers, Gregory W; Soize, Sebastien; Blasco, Jordi; Davis, Stephen M; Nogueira, Raul G; Dávalos, Antoni; Menon, Bijoy K; van der Lugt, Aad; Muir, Keith W; Roos, Yvo B W E M; White, Phil; Mitchell, Peter J; Demchuk, Andrew M; van Zwam, Wim H; Jovin, Tudor G; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J; Dippel, Diederik W J; Campbell, Bruce C V; Guillemin, Francis; Bracard, Serge; Hill, Michael D; Goyal, Mayank; Marquering, Henk A; Majoie, Charles B L M",JAMA neurology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaneurol.2018.3661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30615038/,58661294.0

Laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (PN) has gained recognition after technical refinements were able to match the well-established criteria for open partial nephrectomy. Laparoendoscopic surgery (LESS) is one of the approaches to further minimize invasiveness of laparoscopic surgery. OBJECTIVE We report our initial experience with LESS partial nephrectomy in single-incision transumbilical surgery technique (SITUS) in daily clinical practice. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS From 2010, patients undergoing SITUS-PN were prospectively evaluated. Patients with small, solitary or multiple, exophytic-enhancing renal masses were selected, whereas patients with solitary kidney, endophytic or hilar tumors were excluded. Important clinical data, PADUA and RENAL score, were assessed prospectively. MEASUREMENTS Patients' characteristics, perioperative, hematologic and pathologic data as well as pain evaluation using the visual analogue pain scale (VAPS) were assessed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS A total of 13 patients underwent LESS-PN/SITUS-PN (6 right and 7 left renal units). One patient was converted to conventional laparoscopy requiring two additional ports to treat bleeding from renal vessels. Pathology revealed renal cell carcinoma in nine patients, oncocytoma in one and benign cyst in three patients. No positive surgical margin was observed.

The objective of this study was to assess health disparities associated with influenza infection based on median household income and educational attainment. METHODS We geocoded people with documented confirmed influenza infection by home address to identify the US Census 2010 tract in which they lived during 4 influenza surveillance seasons (2013-2014, 2015-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2018) in Rhode Island. We dichotomized influenza as severe if the person with influenza infection was hospitalized (ie, inpatient) or as nonsevere if the person was not hospitalized (ie, outpatient). We examined 2 socioeconomic factors: median household income (defined as low, medium low, medium high, and high) and educational attainment (defined as a ratio among people who completed <high school, high school, some college, or ≥bachelor's degree). We calculated relative rates (RRs) to determine the associated level of risk for each socioeconomic factor. RESULTS The incidence of influenza per 100 000 person-years was significantly higher in populations with low vs high median household income (620 vs 303; P < .001) and in populations with low vs high educational attainment (583 vs 323; P < .001). The RR of a severe infection in the quartile with the lowest educational attainment (0.57) was significantly higher than the RR in the other 3 quartiles of educational attainment (range, 0.36-0.39; P = .01). However, the RR of a severe infection was higher in the 3 quartiles of median household income (range, 0.38-0.40) than in the quartile with the lowest median household income (0.29).

However, the limit of beneficial and toxic physiological effects of Se is very narrow. In the present study, the antioxidant performance, nutritional composition, long-distance transport of Se, photosynthetic pigments, and growth of Coffea arabica genotypes in response to Se concentration in solution were evaluated. Five Coffea arabica genotypes (Obatã, IPR99, IAC125, IPR100 and Catucaí) were used, which were grown in the absence and presence of Se (0 and 1.0 mmol L-1) in nutrient solution. The application of 1 mmol L-1 Se promoted root browning in all genotypes. There were no visual symptoms of leaf toxicity, but there was a reduction in the concentration of phosphorus and sulfur in the shoots of plants exposed to high Se concentration. Except for genotype Obatã, the coffee seedlings presented strategies for regulating Se uptake by reducing long-distance transport of Se from roots to shoots. The concentrations of total chlorophyll, total pheophytin, and carotenoids were negatively affected in genotypes Obatã, IPR99, and IAC125 upon exposure to Se at 1 mmol L-1. H2O2 production was reduced in genotypes IPR99, IPR100, and IAC125 upon exposure to Se, resulting in lower activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). These results suggest that antioxidant metabolism was effective in regulating oxidative stress in plants treated with Se. The increase in sucrose, and decrease in SOD, CAT and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities, as well as Se compartmentalization in the roots, were the main biochemical and physiological modulatory effects of coffee seedlings under stress conditions due to excess of Se.",2020-10-15,"Mateus, Matheus Pereira de Brito; Tavanti, Renan Francisco Rimoldi; Galindo, Fernando Shintate; Silva, Anne Caroline da Rocha; Gouveia, Geraldo Candido Cabral; Aparecido, Camila Fernandes Ferreira; Carr, Natalia Fernandes; Feitosa, Yara Barros; Santos, Elcio Ferreira; Lavres, José; Reis, André Rodrigues Dos",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888590/,221504494.0

Pharmacologic research with marine chemicals continue to contribute potentially novel chemical leads in the ongoing global search for therapeutic agents in the treatment of multiple diverse categories. As infectious diseases evolve and develop resistance to existing pharmaceuticals, the marine environment provides novel leads against fungal, parasitic, bacterial and viral diseases. Limitations in our current antiviral treatment options and the continuing emergence of new pathogenic viruses have contributed to a growing need for new and effective chemotherapeutic agents to treat viral diseases. The search for potent antiviral agents is urgent in view of the dramatic situation of the global human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic, a possible spread of avian influenza and of other viral diseases. Effective antiviral therapeutics are not available, and the presently approved therapy for HIV has been recognized to be toxic, unable to eradicate the causative virus, and to induce severe drug resistance. The marine environment provides a rich source of chemical diversity for the screening and identification of new compounds with desirable antiviral properties. Antiviral testing has revealed numerous compounds from structural classes including polysaccharides, terpenoids, steroids, alkaloids and peptides that potentially inhibit both RNA and DNA viruses.

BIs greater than 40% of total body surface area are considered extensive and result in local and systemic response. We sought to assess morphological and myogenic mechanisms through both short- and long-term intensive insulin therapies that affect the skeletal muscle after extensive skin BI in young rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wistar rats aged 21 d were distributed into four groups: control (C), control with insulin (C + I), scald burn injury (SI), and SI with insulin (SI + I). The SI groups were submitted to a 45% total body surface area burn, and the C + I and SI + I groups received insulin (5 UI/Kg/d) for 4 or 14 d. Glucose tolerance and the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance index were determined. Gastrocnemius muscles were analyzed for histopathological, morphometric, and immunohistochemical myogenic parameters (Pax7, MyoD, and MyoG); in addition, the expression of genes related to muscle atrophy (MuRF1 and MAFbx) and its regulation (IGF-1) were also assessed. RESULTS: Short-term treatment with insulin favored muscle regeneration by primary myogenesis and decreased muscle atrophy in animals with BIs, whereas the long-term treatment modulated myogenesis by increasing the MyoD protein. Both treatments improved histopathological parameters and secondary myogenesis by increasing the MyoG protein.

In this study, we carried out a transcriptome analysis using RNA-sequencing to decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms of Onobrychis viciifolia responding and adapting to the extreme natural environment in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). The transcriptome data of plant samples collected from two different altitudes revealed a total of 8212 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 5387 up-regulated and 2825 down-regulated genes. Detailed analysis of the identified DEGs uncovered that up-regulation of genes potentially leading to changes in hormone homeostasis and signaling, particularly abscisic acid-related ones, and enhanced biosynthesis of polyphenols play vital roles in the adaptive processes of O. viciifolia. Interestingly, several DEGs encoding uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases, which putatively regulate phytohormone homeostasis to resist environmental stresses, were also discovered. Furthermore, numerous DEGs encoding transcriptional factors, such as members of the myeloblastosis (MYB), homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP), WRKY, and nam-ataf1,2-cuc2 (NAC) families, might be involved in the adaptive responses of O. viciifolia to the extreme natural environmental conditions. The DEGs identified in this study represent candidate targets for improving environmental stress resistance of O. viciifolia grown in higher altitudes of the QTP, and can provide deep insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the responses of this plant species to the extreme natural environmental conditions of the QTP.",2020,"Yin, Hengxia; Zhou, Huakun; Wang, Wenying; Tran, Lam-Son Phan; Zhang, Benyin",Biomolecules,,#32604957,,,,,220282553.0

The purpose of this study was to quantify the effect of intracranial stenting on the RC of the implanted artery using 3D datasets. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four patients receiving FDA-approved neurovascular stents to support coil embolization of brain aneurysms were chosen for this study. The stents were located in the ICA, ACA, or MCA. We analyzed C-arm rotational angiography and contrast-enhanced cone beam CT datasets before and after stent implantation, respectively, to ascertain changes in vessel curvature. The images were reconstructed, and the vessel centerline was extracted. From the centerline, the RC was calculated. RESULTS The average implanted stent length was 25.4 ± 5.8 mm, with a pre-implantation RC of 7.1 ± 2.1 mm and a postimplantation RC of 10.7 ± 3.5 mm. This resulted in a 3.6 ± 2.7 mm change in the RC due to implantation (P < .0001), more than a 50% increase from the pre-implantation value. There was no difference in the change of RC for the different locations studied. The change in RC was not impacted by the extent of coil packing within the aneurysm. CONCLUSIONS The implantation of neurovascular stents can be shown to have a large impact on the RC of the vessel. This will lead to a change in the local hemodynamics and flow pattern within the aneurysm.",2012,"King, R M; Chueh, J-Y; van der Bom, I M J; Silva, C F; Carniato, S L; Spilberg, G; Wakhloo, A K; Gounis, M J",AJNR.

In recent years, transgenic technology has become more versatile and sophisticated, mainly because of the incorporation of recombinase-mediated conditional expression and targeted insertion, site-specific endonuclease-mediated genome editing, siRNA-mediated gene knockdown, various inducible gene expression systems, and fluorescent protein marking and tracking techniques. Site-specific recombinases (such as PhiC31) and engineered endonucleases (such as ZFN and Talen) have significantly enhanced our ability to target transgenes into specific genomic loci, but currently a great majority of transgenic mouse lines are continuingly being created using the conventional random insertion method. A major challenge for using this conventional method is that the genomic environment at the integration site has a substantial influence on the expression of the transgene. Although our understanding of such chromosomal position effects and our means to combat them are still primitive, adhering to some general guidelines can significantly increase the odds of successful transgene expression. This chapter first discusses the major problems associated with transgene expression, and then describes some of the principles for using plasmid and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) for generating transgenic constructs.

This spatial-valence metaphoric congruency effect reflects top-positive/bottom-negative metaphoric association and may be attributed to at least three possible mechanisms: spreading activation between spatial and valence concepts (activation account), epistemic function that a conceptual metaphor serves to reduce the uncertainty associated with valence concepts (epistemic account), and/or the extent to which spatial-valence metaphoric association is relevant to task demand (relevance account). In three experiments, we manipulated congruency proportion, target eccentricity, and valence strength in a word valence judgment task to test these three possible accounts. Results showed that the metaphoric congruency effect was larger when a high (vs. equal) proportion of targets appears in congruent, relative to incongruent, position, and for targets with strong (vs. weak) valence.

The World Health Organization declared it a pandemic in March 2020, and many sporting events were canceled. Materials and Methods: We examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on endurance and ultra-endurance running (UER) and analyzed finishes and events during the COVID-19 pandemic (observation period March 2020-October 2020) to the same time period pre-COVID-19 outbreak (March 2019-October 2019). Results: Endurance finishes decreased during the pandemic (459,029 to 42,656 (male: 277,493 to 25,582; female 181,536 to 17,074; all p < 0.001).

To maintain control of infection while also reducing disruption to populations, there is a need to understand what combination of measures-including novel digital tracing approaches and less intensive physical distancing-might be required to reduce transmission. We aimed to estimate the reduction in transmission under different control measures across settings and how many contacts would be quarantined per day in different strategies for a given level of symptomatic case incidence. METHODS: For this mathematical modelling study, we used a model of individual-level transmission stratified by setting (household, work, school, or other) based on BBC Pandemic data from 40â162 UK participants. We simulated the effect of a range of different testing, isolation, tracing, and physical distancing scenarios. Under optimistic but plausible assumptions, we estimated reduction in the effective reproduction number and the number of contacts that would be newly quarantined each day under different strategies. RESULTS: We estimated that combined isolation and tracing strategies would reduce transmission more than mass testing or self-isolation alone: mean transmission reduction of 2% for mass random testing of 5% of the population each week, 29% for self-isolation alone of symptomatic cases within the household, 35% for self-isolation alone outside the household, 37% for self-isolation plus household quarantine, 64% for self-isolation and household quarantine with the addition of manual contact tracing of all contacts, 57% with the addition of manual tracing of acquaintances only, and 47% with the addition of app-based tracing only. If limits were placed on gatherings outside of home, school, or work, then manual contact tracing of acquaintances alone could have an effect on transmission reduction similar to that of detailed contact tracing. In a scenario where 1000 new symptomatic cases that met the definition to trigger contact tracing occurred per day, we estimated that, in most contact tracing strategies, 15â000-41â000 contacts would be newly quarantined each day. INTERPRETATION: Consistent with previous modelling studies and country-specific COVID-19 responses to date, our analysis estimated that a high proportion of cases would need to self-isolate and a high proportion of their contacts to be successfully traced to ensure an effective reproduction number lower than 1 in the absence of other measures. If combined with moderate physical distancing measures, self-isolation and contact tracing would be more likely to achieve control of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission.

The demographics and clinical presentations of patients infected with different genotypes of hMPV were compared. A total of 135 samples were positive for hMPV (positive detection rate: 5.2%). Co‐infection with other viruses was observed in 45.9% (62/135) of cases, and human bocavirus was the most common additional respiratory virus.

Methods Individual information on confirmed cases from January 21 to March 2 was collected from provincial or municipal health commissions. We identified the difference between imported and local cases in the epidemiological characteristics. Two models were established to estimate the factors associated with time interval from symptom onset to hospitalization (TOH) and length of hospital stay (LOS) respectively. Results Among 7,042 cases, 3392 (48.17%) were local cases and 3304 (46.92%) were imported cases. Since the first intervention was adopted in Hubei on January 23, the daily reported imported cases reached a peak on January 28 and gradually decreased since then. Imported cases were on average younger (41 vs. 48), and had more male (58.66% vs. 47.53%) compared to local cases. Furthermore, imported cases had more contacts with other confirmed cases (2.80 ± 2.33 vs. 2.17 ± 2.10), which were mainly within family members (2.26 ± 2.18 vs. 1.57 ± 2.06). The TOH and LOS were 2.67 ± 3.69 and 18.96 ± 7.63 days respectively, and a longer TOH was observed in elderly living in the provincial capital cities that were higher migration intensity with Hubei.

This systemic review summarizes and synthesizes findings from studies relevant to the relationship between vitamin D and stroke risk, severity, and outcome; potential mechanisms explaining such a relationship; and outcomes from vitamin D supplementation. The literature shows that vitamin D deficiency is a significant risk factor for ischemic stroke, with sun exposure, sex, age, race, diabetes, and genetics playing a role as well. Stroke severity and short-and long-term outcomes also worsen with vitamin D deficiency. The neuroprotective mechanisms by which vitamin D operates to mitigate stroke onset and outcomes have yet to be fully studied, but researchers have proposed several pathways, including promotion of certain neuroprotective growth factors, reduction of arterial pressure through vasodilation, and inhibition of reactive oxygen species. There is some evidence that vitamin D supplementation could lower stroke risk and improve recovery, though outcomes can also be negligible or negative. Although results are mixed and the limitations of vitamin D supplementation merit some caution, vitamin D overall plays a significant role in stroke health.

Methods After a standard approach laparoscopic pyelolithotomy in a patient with a large (42 × 36 mm) pelvic calculus, Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty was performed. A transverse posterior colpotomy was performed laparoscopically with the assistance of the Colpassist Vaginal Positioning Device (Boston Scientific) and the calculus was extracted, intact, through the vagina with the aid of an endoscopic retrieval bag. The vaginal incision was then closed intra-corporeally. A systematic review on the topic was also performed. Results The stone was removed in its entirety through an occult vaginal incision. There were no complications reported and the patient was stone free at follow-ups. Conclusions This simple, novel technique is an easily reproducible method, for the removal of large urinary calculi during either traditional laparoscopic or robotic-assisted laparoscopic stone surgery in the appropriate female patient.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there will be a wait-list for rescheduling colonoscopies once the mitigation is lifted. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the accuracy of stool DNA methylation tests in detecting colorectal cancer. METHODS: The PubMed, Cochrane Library and MEDLINE via Ovid were searched. Studies reporting the accuracy (Sackett phase 2 or 3) of stool DNA methylation tests to detect sporadic colorectal cancer were included. The DerSimonian-Laird method with random-effects model was utilized for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Forty-six studies totaling 16 149 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of all single genes and combinations was 62.7% (57.7%, 67.4%) and 91% (89.5%, 92.2%), respectively. Combinations of genes provided higher sensitivity compared to single genes (80.8% [75.1%, 85.4%] vs. 57.8% [52.3%, 63.1%]) with no significant decrease in specificity (87.8% [84.1%, 90.7%] vs. 92.1% [90.4%, 93.5%]).

Oblique sagittal images and axial images obtained with a high image matrix are valuable for identifying individual components of the pulley system. Various pathologic processes occur in the biceps pulley as well as the rotator interval. These processes can be traumatic, degenerative, congenital, or secondary to injuries to the surrounding structures. The term hidden lesion refers to an injury of the biceps pulley mechanism and is derived from the difficulty in making clinical and arthroscopic identification. Pathologic conditions associated with pulley lesions include anterosuperior impingement, instability of the biceps tendon, biceps tendinopathy or tendinosis, superior labrum anterior and posterior lesions, and adhesive capsulitis.

We present the discovery of two planets transiting HD 63433 (TOI 1726, TIC 130181866), a young Sun-like ($M_*=0.99\pm0.03$) star. Through kinematics, lithium abundance, and rotation, we confirm that HD 63433 is a member of the Ursa Major moving group ($\tau=414\pm23$ Myr). Based on the TESS light curve and updated stellar parameters, we estimate the planet radii are $2.15\pm0.10R_\oplus$ and $2.67\pm0.12R_\oplus$, the orbital periods are 7.11 and 20.55 days, and the orbital eccentricities are lower than about 0.2. Using HARPS-N velocities, we measure the Rossiter-McLaughlin signal of the inner planet, demonstrating that the orbit is prograde.

Few studies have reported the occurrence of asynchrony in brain-injured patients. We aimed to investigate the prevalence, type and severity of patient–ventilator asynchrony in mechanically ventilated patients with brain injury. METHODS: This prospective observational study enrolled acute brain-injured patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Esophageal pressure monitoring was established after enrollment. Flow, airway pressure, and esophageal pressure–time waveforms were recorded for a 15-min interval, four times daily for 3 days, for visually detecting asynchrony by offline analysis. At the end of each dataset recording, the respiratory drive was determined by the airway occlusion maneuver. The asynchrony index was calculated to represent the severity. The relationship between the prevalence and the severity of asynchrony with ventilatory modes and settings, respiratory drive, and analgesia and sedation were determined. Association of severe patient–ventilator asynchrony, which was defined as an asynchrony index ≥ 10%, with clinical outcomes was analyzed. RESULTS: In 100 enrolled patients, a total of 1076 15-min waveform datasets covering 330,292 breaths were collected, in which 70,156 (38%) asynchronous breaths were detected. Asynchrony occurred in 96% of patients with the median (interquartile range) asynchrony index of 12.4% (4.3%–26.4%). The most prevalent type was ineffective triggering. No significant difference was found in either prevalence or asynchrony index among different classifications of brain injury (p > 0.05). The prevalence of asynchrony was significantly lower during pressure control/assist ventilation than during other ventilatory modes (p < 0.05). Compared to the datasets without asynchrony, the airway occlusion pressure was significantly lower in datasets with ineffective triggering (p < 0.001). The asynchrony index was significantly higher during the combined use of opioids and sedatives (p < 0.001). Significantly longer duration of ventilation and hospital length of stay after the inclusion were found in patients with severe ineffective triggering (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patient–ventilator asynchrony is common in brain-injured patients. The most prevalent type is ineffective triggering and its severity is likely related to a long duration of ventilation and hospital stay. Prevalence and severity of asynchrony are associated with ventilatory modes, respiratory drive and analgesia/sedation strategy, suggesting treatment adjustment in this particular population.

These compounds, among other things, exert a wide variety of antimicrobial activities through structural changes of peptides upon metal binding and redox chemistry. They exhibit different mechanisms of action (MOA), including the modification of DNA/RNA, protein and cell wall synthesis, permeabilization and modulation of gradients of cellular membranes. Nowadays, the large increase in antibiotic resistance represents a crucial problem to limit progression at the pandemic level of the diseases that seemed nearly eradicated, such as tuberculosis (Tb). Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics due to chromosomal mutations which can lead to the onset of novel strains. Consequently, the maximum pharmaceutical effort should be focused on the development of new therapeutic agents and antimicrobial peptides can represent a valuable option as a copious source of potential bioactive compounds. The introduction of a metal center can improve chemical diversity and hence specificity and bioavailability while, in turn, the coordination to peptides of metal complexes can protect them and enhance their poor water solubility and air stability: the optimization of these parameters is strictly required for drug prioritization and to obtain potent inhibitors of Mtb infections with novel MOAs.

Unfortunately, it coincided with the major shrimp farming season in India which contributes 60% of the national annual shrimp production hence the impact was substantial. An on-line survey was carried out among the stakeholders of the shrimp farming sector to evaluate the prospective impact of COVID-19 related lockdown across the shrimp supply chain. The study estimated an economic loss of 1.50 billion USD to the shrimp aquaculture sector during the current year. It is expected that shrimp production and its export performance may be declining by 40% in the current season. The Garret ranking and Rank Based Quotient analyses projected severe constraints in shrimp seed production and supply, disruptions in the supply chain, logistics, farming, processing, marketing and loss of employment and income for the workers due to the pandemic. To mitigate the impact, the Government of India declared fisheries and aquaculture as an essential activity, facilitated the movement of inputs and services. Further, a major Fisheries Development Scheme(PMMSY) with a financial outlay of 267 million USD has been announced to usher in a blue revolution by strengthening the value chain, doubling the fisher/farmer income, employment generation, economic and social security for fishers/fish farmers adhering to the sustainability principles.

RECENT FINDINGS Solvent detergent-treated pooled plasma has proved to be well suited for the production of pathogen-reduced ABO-universal plasma. One such product, Bioplasma FDP, was licensed in South Africa in 1994 and has since 1996 been in successful clinical use. A clinical study with this product and two studies with the European product, Uniplas, have confirmed the efficacy and safety of pathogen-reduced ABO-universal plasma. SUMMARY Pooling of plasma enables the production of ABO-universal plasma. Pathogen reduction with solvent detergent eliminates lipid-enveloped viruses, whereas neutralizing antibodies in the plasma pool and nucleic acid amplification testing ensures the safety for recognized nonlipid-enveloped viruses. Pooling also eliminates transfusion-associated acute lung injury (the leading cause of plasma transfusion-related death), reduces immunologic/allergic adverse events by 60-80% and standardizes plasma protein content. Thus, in addition to ABO compatibility, pathogen-reduced ABO-universal plasma has important supplementary benefits that improve the product's cost-effectiveness.",2008,"Solheim, Bjarte G; Chetty, Rangini; Flesland, Oystein",Current opinion in hematology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1097/moh.0b013e32831366d3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18832933/,26002815.0

Here, we report the application of this newly developed advanced type of operating theater for the endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA), along with an evaluation of our initial experiences. METHODS: The study population consisted of 18 patients with parasellar tumor. All patients underwent surgery via the EEA in SCOT®. During all procedures, various types of intraoperative information, including electrophysiological monitoring, anatomical orientation with navigation system, intraoperative MRI, and endoscopic images of the operative field, were collected and stored by OPeLiNK®. Furthermore, the intraoperative information was shared with the surgical strategy desk, where a senior neurosurgeon can direct and manage the surgical procedure in real-time. RESULTS: We successfully completed the surgical procedures in SCOT® in all cases. Using OPeLiNK®, operators in SCOT® were able to share various data, such as images obtained intraoperatively and surgical instrument position from navigation systems, as well as images of the surgical field with senior neurosurgeons at the surgical strategy desk in all cases. Surgically relevant information from these sources was transmitted through an application and displayed to all surgical staff. The necessary nuances were reflected in the surgical procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The SCOT®, which is considered an innovative operation system in neurosurgery, enables both quality and safety in the EEA. Furthermore, the use of SCOT® may also contribute to the education of young neurosurgeons.",2020,"Ogiwara, Toshihiro; Goto, Tetsuya; Fujii, Yu; Nakamura, Takuya; Suzuki, Yota; Hanaoka, Yoshiki; Ito, Kiyoshi; Horiuchi, Tetsuyoshi; Hongo, Kazuhiro",World neurosurgery (Online),,#33385602,,,,,230108599.0

It is not certain how the presence of other metabolic factors and comorbidities influences HCC risk in HBV. Therefore we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to seek evidence for significant associations. Methods: MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched from 1st January 2000 to 24th June 2020 for English studies investigating associations of metabolic factors and comorbidities with HCC risk in individuals with chronic HBV infection. We extracted data for meta-analysis and report pooled effect estimates from a fixed-effects model. Pooled estimates from a random-effects model were also generated if significant heterogeneity was present. Results: We identified 40 observational studies reporting on associations of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipiaemia and obesity with HCC risk. Meta-analysis was possible for only diabetes mellitus due to the limited number of studies. Diabetes mellitus was associated with >25% increase in hazards of HCC (fixed effects Hazards Ratio [HR] 1.26, 95% CI 1.20-1.32, random effects HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.23-1.49). This association was attenuated towards the null in sensitivity analysis restricted to studies adjusted for metformin use. Conclusions: In adults with chronic HBV infection, diabetes mellitus is a significant risk factor for HCC, but further investigation of how antidiabetic drug use and glycaemic control influence this association is needed.

Their own needs during the assisted dying journey are often, however, unrecognized and underrepresented in policies and guidelines. Circumstances under which people choose assisted dying, and relational contexts such as the sociopolitical environment, may influence the experiences of family members and healthcare providers. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Ethics approval was not required to conduct this review. AIM This scoping review aims to identify the relational influences on the experiences of family members and healthcare providers of adults who underwent assisted dying and of those unable to access assisted dying due to the loss of capacity to consent. METHODS A literature search was conducted in four databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and PsycINFO. The search retrieved 12,074 articles, a number narrowed down to 172 articles for full-text screening. Thirty-six articles met the established inclusion criteria. A feminist relational framework guided the data analysis. RESULTS Five key themes on the influences of family members' and healthcare providers' experiences throughout the assisted dying process were synthesized from the data. They include (1) relationships as central to beginning the process, (2) social and political influences on decision making, (3) complex roles and responsibilities of family members and healthcare providers, (4) a unique experience of death, and (5) varying experiences following death. CONCLUSION The feminist relational lens, used to guide analysis, shed light on the effect of the sociopolitical influences and the relationships among patients, families, and healthcare providers on each other's experiences. Addressing the needs of the family members and healthcare providers is vital to improving the assisted dying process. Including families' and healthcare providers' needs within institutional policies and enhancing collaboration and communication among those involved could improve the overall experience.",2020-05-21,"Variath, Caroline; Peter, Elizabeth; Cranley, Lisa; Godkin, Dianne; Just, Danielle",Nursing ethics,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/0969733020921493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32436431/,218768452.0

Cross-country comparison could indicate the relative efficacy of these approaches. We assess various non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) over time, comparing the effects of self-imposed (i.e. voluntary) behavior change and of changes enforced via official regulations, by statistically examining their impacts on subsequent death rates in 13 European countries. Methods and findings: We examine two types of NPI: the introduction of government-enforced closure policies over time; and self-imposed alteration of individual behaviors in response to awareness of the epidemic, in the period prior to regulations. Our proxy for the latter is Google mobility data, which captures voluntary behavior change when disease salience is sufficiently high. The primary outcome variable is the rate of change in COVID-19 fatalities per day, 16-20 days after interventions take place. Linear multivariate regression analysis is used to evaluate impacts. Voluntarily reduced mobility, occurring prior to government policies, decreases the percent change in deaths per day by 9.2 percentage points (95% CI 4.5-14.0 pp). Government closure policies decrease the percent change in deaths per day by 14.0 percentage points (95% CI 10.8-17.2 pp). Disaggregating government policies, the most beneficial are intercity travel restrictions, cancelling public events, and closing non-essential workplaces. Other sub-components, such as closing schools and imposing stay-at-home rules, show smaller and statistically insignificant impacts. Conclusions: This study shows that NPIs have substantially reduced fatalities arising from COVID-19. Importantly, the effect of voluntary behavior change is of the same order of magnitude as government-mandated regulations. These findings, including the substantial variation across dimensions of closure, have implications for the phased withdrawal of government policies as the epidemic recedes, and for the possible reimposition of regulations if a second wave occurs, especially given the substantial economic and human welfare consequences of maintaining lockdowns.",2020-08-04,"Jamison, Julian; Bundy, Donald; Jamison, Dean; Spitz, Jacob; Verguet, Stephane",,,#20166793,,,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.02.20166793; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.02.20166793v1?rss=1,220956743.0

The spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 is a major antigen and its engagement with human ACE2 receptor plays an essential role in viral entry into host cells. Consequently, antibodies targeting the ACE2-interacting surface (ACE2IS) located in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein can neutralize the virus. However, the understanding of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 is still limited, and it is unclear how the virus protects this surface from recognition by antibodies. Here, we designed an RBD mutant that disrupts the ACE2IS and used it to characterize the prevalence of antibodies directed to the ACE2IS from convalescent sera of 94 COVID19-positive patients. We found that only a small fraction of RBD-binding antibodies targeted the ACE2IS. To assess the immunogenicity of different parts of the spike protein, we performed in vitro antibody selection for the spike and the RBD proteins using both unbiased and biased selection strategies. Intriguingly, unbiased selection yielded antibodies that predominantly targeted regions outside the ACE2IS, whereas ACE2IS-binding antibodies were readily identified from biased selection designed to enrich such antibodies. Furthermore, antibodies from an unbiased selection using the RBD preferentially bound to the surfaces that are inaccessible in the context of whole spike protein. These results suggest that the ACE2IS has evolved less immunogenic than the other regions of the spike protein, which has important implications in the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.",2020-11-03,"Hattori, Takamitsu; Koide, Akiko; Panchenko, Tatyana; Romero, Larizbeth A.; Teng, Kai Wen; Tada, Takuya; Landau, Nathaniel R.; Koide, Shohei",bioRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/63668512761a18b2a2bc92c3bfbb7b59bf7e1bf5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/3ceb65cca5b004945956db40d74a382201d35781.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7654858.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33173869/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.03.365270,226304288.0

However, respiratory tract infections in nose, larynx and/or bronchi, either viral or bacterial or both, are by far the commonest cause of acute cough. These are especially frequent and hazardous in the elderly, and community living and institutionalisation may aggravate this problem. A variety of viruses and bacteria have been incriminated, with rhinovirus, influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza and Bordetella pertussis being especially important. Viral infections can readily lead to community-acquired pneumonia. Successful diagnosis should point to successful treatment, and in this respect clinical examination and patient history are paramount, supplemented by chest X-ray, viral and bacterial culture and serological testing. Depending on the results of these tests, specific antibacterial therapy may be called for, although there is dispute as to the merits of antibacterial therapy in cases of uncertain diagnosis. Prevention and prophylaxis for influenza and S. pneumoniae infections are now commendably routine in the elderly, especially those in communities. Treatment, as well as the use of antibacterials, may also be directed against the inflammatory and infective processes in the airways. Non-specific antitussive therapy is common and usually highly desirable to prevent the adverse effects of repeated coughing. There have been few advances in antitussive therapy in recent years, opioids and dextromethorphan being the most commonly used agents; they act centrally on the brainstem, but also have a large placebo effect. However they work, they are much appreciated by patients and their partners. Moreover, striking advances in our understanding of the peripheral sensory and central nervous pathways of the cough reflex in recent years should soon lead to a new and more specific choice of agents to inhibit cough.",2012-08-29,"Widdicombe, John; Kamath, Shankar",Drugs Aging,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0693ce44c8059f0c65a977fa97e2d86d581698c7.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7100077.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15012170/,25922612.0

All participants were exposed to the Washington State COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: Primary and secondary COVID-19 prevention strategies were feasibly integrated into ongoing care coordination and behavioral interventions for at-risk patients. Beyond the compilation of case studies, as an iterative method, RAPICE data collection naturalistically evolved to include observations of intervention team activity occurring within the larger pandemic epicenter context. A daily clinical research team huddle that flexibly accommodated virtual participation was also feasibly implemented. CONCLUSIONS: Primary and secondary COVID-19 prevention strategies can be feasibly integrated into ongoing clinical interventions during the pandemic. Routine, proactive clinical and research team communication that transparently addresses ethical tensions and health-sustaining activities may promote well-being for providers grappling with rapidly evolving pandemic directives. Proactive assessments of individual provider vulnerabilities for severe COVID-19 related respiratory illness may also be a crucial element of the health care system pandemic responses.",2020,"Moloney, Kathleen; Scheuer, Hannah; Engstrom, Allison; Schreiber, Merritt; Whiteside, Lauren; Nehra, Deepika; Walen, Mary Lou; Rivara, Frederick; Zatzick, Douglas",Psychiatry,,#125066,,,,,216556740.0

Monitoring exposed individuals is labor intensive and available tools are often limited. MITRE, a company that operates federally funded research and development centers for the U.S. government, rapidly developed a configurable monitoring tool that allows public health authorities to monitor potentially exposed individuals in their jurisdictions. METHODS: A team, including public health leaders, field epidemiologists, software engineers, and health communication specialists, was quickly assembled to design and develop an open source, disease-independent monitoring tool called Sara Alert. Outreach to key public health stakeholders, including partner organizations and local and state health departments, was conducted early for requirements gathering and to validate assumptions. Public health law experts were consulted regarding data privacy and security. RESULTS: By four weeks, a minimally viable monitoring tool was available for testing by public health partners. Exposed individuals can be enrolled and reminded daily to enter a temperature and any symptoms by web or mobile interface, SMS messaging or phone. Public health officials monitor and can quickly take action if symptoms consistent with COVID-19 are reported of if there is failure to report within a configurable time frame. Dashboards provide insight into aggregated data appropriate to level of view. CONCLUSIONS: Sara Alert serves as a force multiplier that supports disease containment and allows resources to be directed where they are most needed. Successful development was possible because key stakeholders across public health practice were consulted early. Sara Alert is available, free, to state and local public health departments and serves as an enduring resource easily configured for the next public health emergency.

Most studies were retrospective, and results may not be generalizable due to differences in demographics, healthcare organization and surge capacity. We present a cohort of mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients from a resource-rich, publicly financed healthcare system. METHODS: Prospective study from a tertiary hospital. Consecutive SARS-CoV-2 positive adult patients admitted to the ICU for mechanical ventilation from 10 March 2020 to 04 May 2020 were included. Triage and treatment were protocolized. High-dose dalteparin was adjusted by D-dimer. Demographics, treatments and high-resolution physiological variables were collected. Outcomes were 30-day and hospital mortality. Data are medians (quartiles). RESULTS: Of the 1484 persons in the hospital catchment area testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, 201 (13.5%) were hospitalized. Thirty-eight (19%) patients were mechanically ventilated, of whom five (13%) died. Of the 163 patients treated with supplemental oxygen, eight (5%) died. In ventilated patients (75% males, age 61 (53-70) years), severe, moderate and mild ARDS was present in 25%, 70% and 5%. Tidal volume &#8804;8 mL/kg ideal bodyweight was achieved in 34 (94%) patients. Proning and neuromuscular blockers were used in 19 (54%) and 20 (61%) patients.

On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-2019) outbreak, a pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection including the potential mechanisms and therapeutic options. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search from December 01, 2019 to May 14, 2020 using multiple combinations of keywords from PubMed and Ovid Medline databases according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We included articles with cases of COVID-19 where neurological involvement was evident. RESULTS: We were able to identify 82 cases of COVID-19 with neurological complications. The mean age was 62.3 years. 37.8% of the patients were women (n = 31). 48.8% of the patients (n = 40) had cerebrovascular insults, 28% (n = 23) had neuromuscular disorders, and 23% of the patients (n = 19) had encephalitis or encephalopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological manifestations of COVID-19 are not rare, especially large vessel stroke, Guillain-Barre syndrome, and meningoencephalitis. Moving forward, further studies are needed to clarify the prevalence of the neurological complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection, investigate their biological backgrounds, and test treatment options.

207343,fdejj8e7,,WHO,Natural versus Recombinant Viral Antigens in SARS-CoV-2 Serology: Challenges in Optimizing Laboratory Diagnosis of COVID-19,,,,unk,"OBJECTIVES: COVID-19 is a public health emergency of international concern whose detection in recovered asymptomatic patients is dependent on accurate diagnosis as it enables the estimation of the susceptibility of the population to the infection. This demand has resulted in the development of several commercial assays employing recombinant proteins, but the results of these assays are not reliable as they do not involve comparison with natural viral antigens. We independently used the SARS-CoV-2 whole viral antigen (WVA) and recombinant nucleocapsid protein (rNP) to develop in-house ELISAs for IgG detection; the results of these ELISAs were then compared to obtain reliable results. METHODS: WVA and rNP ELISAs were performed on COVID-19 negative sera from patients before the pandemic in Brazil, and on RT-qPCR-positive or SARS-CoV-2-IgG against rNP and IgG against WVA-positive samples from recently infected patients in Sao Paulo, Brazil. RESULTS: Both ELISAs detected a large fraction of infected patients but exhibited certain drawbacks. Higher signals and lower numbers of false-negatives were observed in rNP ELISA; however, a higher fraction of false-positives was observed in control groups. A high number of false-negatives was observed with WVA ELISA. Correlating the results of rNP and WVA ELISAs resulted in improved performance for COVID-19 diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The choice of antigen is an important aspect in optimizing the laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19. The use of rNP ELISA for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies seems promising, but comparison of the results with those of WVA ELISA is crucial for accurate test development prior to commercialization. IgG serology using several assays, and with the spectral patterns of SARS-CoV-2, resulted in confusing information that must be clarified before the establishment of diagnostic serology criteria.",2020,"Meireles, Luciana Regina; da Silva, Angélica Moura Freixeira; Carvalho, Camila Aparecida; Kesper, Norival; Galisteo, Andrés Jimenez; Soares, Camila Pereira; Araujo, Danielle Bastos; Durigon, Edison Luiz; Oliveira, Danielle Bruna Leal; Morganti, Lígia; Chura-Chambi, Rosa Maria; de Andrade, Heitor Franco",Clinics (Sao Paulo),,#983840,,,,,227209828.0

The objective of this study was to assess the well-being, resilience, burnout, and wellness factors and needs of EM physicians and advanced practice providers (APPs) during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A longitudinal, descriptive, prospective cohort survey study of 213 EM physicians and APPs was performed across ten emergency departments in a single state, including academic and community settings. Participants were recruited via email to complete four weekly, voluntary, anonymous questionnaires comprised of customized and validated tools for assessing wellness (Well Being Index), burnout (Physician Work Life Study item), and resilience (Brief Resilience Scale) during the initial acceleration phase of COVID-19. Univariate and multivariate analysis with Chi-squared, Fisherâ&#8482;s Exact, and logistic regression was performed. Results: Of 213 eligible participants, response rates ranged from 31 to 53% over four weeks. Women comprised 54 to 60% of responses. Nonrespondent characteristics were similar to respondents. Concern for personal safety decreased from 85% to 61% (p<0.001). Impact on basic self-care declined from 66% to 32% (p<0.001). Symptoms of stress, anxiety or fear was initially 83% and reduced to 66% (p=0.009). Reported strain on relationships and feelings of isolation affected >50% of respondents initially without significant change (p=0.05 and p=0.30 respectively). Women were nearly twice as likely to report feelings of isolation as men (OR 1.95; 95%CI 1.82-5.88). Working part-time carried twice the risk of burnout (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.10-5.47). Baseline resilience was normal to high. Provider well-being improved over the four-weeks (30% to 14%; p=0.01), but burnout did not significantly change (30% to 22%; p=0.39). Conclusion: This survey of frontline EM providers during the initial surge of COVID-19 found that despite being a resilient group, the majority experienced stress, anxiety, fear, and concerns about personal safety due to COVID-19, with many at risk for burnout.

These strategies now include germline-targeting, lineage-based, and structure-guided immunogen design. This narrative review outlines the historical context of HIV vaccinology, and subsequently highlights the scientific discoveries over the last six years that promise to propel the field forward. METHODS: We conducted a search of two electronic databases, PubMed® and EMBASE® for experimental studies involving novel HIV immunogen design between 2013 and 2019. During the title and abstract reviews, publications were excluded if they (1) were written in a non-English language and/or (2) were a letter to the editor, a commentary, or a conference only presentation. We then used ClinicalTrials.gov®, to identify completed and ongoing clinical trials using these strategies. FINDINGS: The HIV vaccinology field has undergone periods of significant growth over the last three decades. Findings elucidated in preclinical studies have revealed the importance of the interaction between the cellular and humoral immune system. As a result, several novel rationally-designed vaccine strategies have been developed and explored in the last six years including native-like Env trimers, nanoparticle and mRNA vaccine design strategies among others.

In this work we performed an independent evaluation of the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit Researh Use Only (Altona) for SARS-CoV-2 detection. METHODS: A comparative limit of detection (LoD) assessment was performed between RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 and the currently WHO recommended RT-PCR (WHO-PCR) workflow using a quantified clinical sample. Assessment of the RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 assay was also performed using 83 primary clinical samples in comparison with the WHO-PCR. RESULTS: The RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated a slightly higher sensitivity than the WHO recommended assay with a limit of detection at 625 copies/mL instead of 1250 copies/mL for the WHO-PCR in our conditions. The overall percent agreement between RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 and WHO-PCR on 83 clinical samples was 97.6 % (81/83) with a sensitivity at 97.8 % (45/46) and specificity at 97.3 % (36/37).

Recently, SMART Coils (Penumbra Inc., Alameda, California, USA) have been developed, which transition in softness along the length of their coils. We report the initial clinical results with this technology. METHODS A retrospective study of all patients undergoing aneurysm coiling with SMART Coils at 2 centers was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this new technology. Outcome and angiographic data were self-reported by individual treatment centers. RESULTS Fifty-nine patients underwent treatment for cerebral aneurysms with SMART Coils (44% in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage). Mean aneurysm size was 5.9 ± 2 mm × 4.5 ± 2 mm. Mean neck size was 3.4 ± 1 mm. More than half (54.2%) of the patients underwent coiling exclusively with SMART Coils. The remainder used either framing or finishing coils of another type. About one third (33.9%) underwent balloon-assisted coiling, and 47.5% underwent stent-assisted coiling. There were no device malfunctions in any of the patients. Six (10.1%) minor complications without clinical sequelae occurred. Raymond I or II occlusion was achieved in 71.2%. CONCLUSIONS Our results demonstrate adequate device safety in a variety of both ruptured and unruptured aneurysm locations. This design enables progressive changes in softness along the length of an individual coil, which offers several potential advantages in the clinical use.

Information on the clinical course and prognosis of COVID-19 was not thoroughly described. We described the clinical courses and prognosis in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Retrospective case series of COVID-19 patients from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in Wuhan and Xishui Hospital, Hubei Province, China, up to February 10, 2020. Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data were collected. The clinical course of survivors and non-survivors were compared. Risk factors for death were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 107 discharged patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. The clinical course of COVID-19 presented as a tri-phasic pattern. Week 1 after illness onset was characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, lymphopenia, and radiological multi-lobar pulmonary infiltrates. In severe cases, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, acute myocardial injury, and adult respiratory distress syndrome were observed. During week 2, in mild cases, fever, cough, and systemic symptoms began to resolve and platelet count rose to normal range, but lymphopenia persisted. In severe cases, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and deteriorating multi-organ dysfunction were dominant. By week 3, mild cases had clinically resolved except for lymphopenia. However, severe cases showed persistent lymphopenia, severe acute respiratory dyspnea syndrome, refractory shock, anuric acute kidney injury, coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, and death.

270633,u42354bf,,WHO,Identifying Prostate Surface Antigen Patterns of Change in Patients with Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer Treated with Abiraterone and Prednisone,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Despite treatment with abiraterone acetate and prednisone (AA/P), most patients with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) will develop castration-resistant disease (metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer [mCRPC]). The early identification of who will progress on AA/P is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the role of prostate surface antigen (PSA) kinetics as a predictor of progression in mHSPC patients treated with AA/P. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with mHSPC who initiated androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and AA/P from June 2017 to February 2019 at the Cleveland Clinic were eligible. PSA-mCRPC was defined as a PSA rise at two consecutive time points. Patients were followed until first mCRPC or last contact after AA/P. Patterns of PSA change were evaluated using a longitudinal mixed model at time 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months from AA/P initiation. The association between PSA profile at 3 months and PSA-mCRPC was examined using survival analysis. Radiographic progression (Rad-mCRPC) was also analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 130 men with follow-up were included. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) follow-up time was 15.3 (10.5, 22.5) months. Eighty-two percent were Caucasian (median age 68.5 years); participants had a median (IQR) PSA of 16.8 (5.3, 48.0) ng/mL. Half of the patients had de novo disease, and 46.2% had high-risk disease (61% had a Gleason score &#8805; 8, 16% had visceral disease, and 54% had three or more bony lesions). The greatest PSA percentage reduction from baseline after AA/P initiation occurred at the first 3 months (median 98.3%). The reduction at 6-12 months from baseline was small (99.7-100%). Patients without PSA-mCRPC had a significantly greater 3-month reduction of PSA values compared to patients who developed PSA-mCRPC (p interaction = 0.0002). 50.8% of patients were able to achieve a non-detectable PSA (median 13.1 months). PSA-mCRPC (n = 20) was observed from 4 to 24 months after AA/P, with the majority of events occurring within the first 12 months. Patients with PSA < 0.3 ng/mL (12-month PSA-mCRPC-free 94.5% vs. 69.4%, p = 0.0004) or a &#8805; 98% reduction (94.9% vs. 68.0%, p = 0.0002) at 3 months had better PSA-mCRPC-free survival compared to their counterparts. Absolute reduction at 3 months was not associated with PSA-mCRPC. Similar PSA patterns were seen in those who had Rad-mCRPC compared to no Rad-mCRPC (p interaction < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The degree of PSA decline at 3 months predicted serologic progression to mCRPC. Those who developed castration-resistant disease had higher PSA and a lower percentage reduction by 3 months. Tracking early PSA pattern changes may alert clinicians to poor treatment effect and potential progression; they should consider frequent PSA measurement and imaging, as well as the initiation of sequential therapy.",2020,"Sheng, Iris Y; Fallah, Jaleh; Gupta, Ruby; Li, Hong; Allman, Kimberly; Martin, Allison; Barata, Pedro; Ornstein, Moshe C; Gilligan, Timothy D; Rini, Brian I; Garcia, Jorge A",Target Oncol,,#641002,,,,,220490302.0

METHODS Fifth-year general surgery residents and GI fellows across six institutions were invited to participate. All general surgery residents had met ACGME/ABS case volume requirements as well as additional institution-specific requirements for endoscopy. All participants completed FES testing at the end of their respective academic year. Procedure volumes were obtained from ACGME case logs. Curricular components for each specialty and institution were recorded. RESULTS Forty-eight (28 surgery and 20 GI) trainees completed the examination. Average case numbers for residents were 76 ± 26 colonoscopies and 45 ± 12 EGDs. Among GI fellows, PGY4 s (N = 10) reported 99 ± 64 colonoscopies and 147 ± 79 EGDs. PGY5 s (N = 3) reported 462 ± 307 colonoscopies and 411 ± 260 EGDs. PGY6 GI fellows (N = 7) reported 515 ± 111 colonoscopies and 418 ± 146 EGDs. The overall pass rate for all participants was 75 %, with 68 % of residents and 85 % of fellows passing both the cognitive and skills components. For surgery residents, pass rates were 75 % for manual skills and 85.7 % for cognitive. On the skills examination, Task 2 (loop reduction) was associated with the lowest performance. Skills scores correlated with both colonoscopy (r = 0.46, p < 0.001) and EGD experience (r = 0.46, p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristics curves were examined among the resident cohort. The minimum number of total cases associated with passing the FES skills component was 103. Significant variability existed in curricular components across institutions.

PBM from BALB/c mice, a strain in which MHV-3 infection results in fatal acute fulminant hepatitis, responds to the virus with a robust PCA response, whereas PBM from C3H/St mice, a strain which develops mild acute hepatitis followed by chronic hepatitis, only exhibit a modest PCA response. In contrast, PBM from A/J mice, a strain fully resistant to MHV-3, generate no increase in PCA above control levels. The induction phase of MHV-3 PCA is rapid, with an increase within 1-1.5 h, with maximum activity at 18h, and it precedes MHV-3 replication in either 17 CL1 cells, a fully permissive cell line, or in monocytes from these strains of mice. The PCA response of BALB/c PBM exceeds the response to any other known stimulus. No induction occurs upon direct stimulation of monocytes by MHV-3, but in the presence of lymphocyte collaboration, the PCA response is observed first at a lymphocyte:monocyte ratio of 2:1 and reaches a maximum as the lymphocyte:monocyte ratio approaches 4:1.

METHODS A total of 1326 laparoscopic varicocelectomy cases performed by 16 participants from July 2005 to June 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. The participants were divided into 2 groups: group A was trained by laparoscopic trainer boxes; group B was trained by a virtual reality training course preoperatively. The operation time curves were drafted, and the learning, improving, and platform stages were divided and statistically confirmed. The operation time and number of cases in the learning and improving stages of both groups were compared. Testicular artery sparing failure and postoperative hydroceles rate were statistically analyzed for the confirmation of the learning curve. RESULTS The learning curve of laparoscopic varicocelectomy was 15 cases, and with 14 cases more, it came into the platform stage. The number of cases for the learning stages of both groups showed no statistical difference (P=.49), but the operation time of group B for the learning stage was less than that of group A (P<.00001). The number of cases of group B for the improving stage was significantly less than that of group A (P=.005), but the operation time of both groups in the improving stage showed no difference (P=.30).

To develop precise anticoronavirus drugs and prophylactics, tissue engineering and biomaterial research strategies can serve as a suitable alternative to the conventional treatment options. Therefore, in this Review, we have highlighted various tissue engineering-based diagnostic systems for SARS-CoV-2 and suggested how these strategies involving organ-on-a-chip, organoids, 3D bioprinting, and advanced bioreactor models can be employed to develop in vitro human tissue models, for more efficient diagnosis, drug/vaccine development, and focusing on the need for patient-specific therapy. We believe that combining the basics of virology with tissue engineering techniques can help the researchers to understand the molecular mechanism underlying viral infection, which is critical for effective drug design. In addition, it can also serve to be a suitable platform for drug testing and delivery of small molecules that can lead to therapeutic tools in this dreaded pandemic situation.

We describe the spectrum of cardiovascular manifestations during a COVID-19 outbreak in Emilia-Romagna, Italy. METHODS: Cross-sectional multicenter study including all diagnosis of KD, myocarditis and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) from February to April,2020. KD patients were compared to those diagnosed before the epidemic. RESULTS: KD: 8 patients (6/8 boys, all negative for SARS-CoV-2); complete presentation in 5/8; 7/8 IVIG-responders; 3/8 showed transient coronary lesions (CALs). MYOCARDITIS: one 5-year-old girl negative for SARS-CoV-2, positive for Parvovirus B19. She responded to IVIG. MIS-C: 4 SARS-CoV-2 positive boys (3 patients with positive swab and serology, 1 patient with negative swab and positive serology). Three presented myocardial dysfunction and pericardial effusion, one developed multicoronary aneurysms and hyperinflammation; all responded to treatment. The fourth boy had mitral and aortic regurgitation that rapidly regressed after steroids. CONCLUSIONS: KD, myocarditis and MIS-C were distinguishable cardiovascular manifestations. KD did not show a more aggressive form compared to previous years: coronary involvement was frequent, but always transient.

We sought to estimate and compare the COVID-19 CFR in Canada and the United States while adjusting for 2 potential biases in crude CFR. METHODS We used the daily incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Canada and the US from Jan. 31 to Apr. 22, 2020. We applied a statistical method to minimize bias in the crude CFR by accounting for the survival interval as the lag time between disease onset and death, while considering reporting rates of COVID-19 cases less than 50% (95% confidence interval 10%-50%). RESULTS Using data for confirmed cases in Canada, we estimated the crude CFR to be 4.9% on Apr. 22, 2020, and the adjusted CFR to be 5.5% (credible interval [CrI] 4.9%-6.4%). After we accounted for various reporting rates less than 50%, the adjusted CFR was estimated at 1.6% (CrI 0.7%-3.1%). The US crude CFR was estimated to be 5.4% on Apr. 20, 2020, with an adjusted CFR of 6.1% (CrI 5.4%-6.9%). With reporting rates of less than 50%, the adjusted CFR for the US was 1.78 (CrI 0.8%-3.6%). INTERPRETATION Our estimates suggest that, if the reporting rate is less than 50%, the adjusted CFR of COVID-19 in Canada is likely to be less than 2%.

In contrast, the techniques of the other strategy are aimed at the destruction of tumors as a whole using the features shared by all cancers, for example relatively fast mitotic cell division or active angiogenesis. While the first strategy is “true” gene therapy, the second one is more like genetic surgery when a surgeon just cuts off a tumor with his scalpel and has no interest in knowing delicate mechanisms of cancer emergence and progression. I will try to substantiate the idea that the last strategy is the only right one, and its simplicity is paradoxically adequate to the super-complexity of tumors that originates from general complexity of cell regulation, strongly disturbed in tumor cells, and especially from the complexity of tumors as evolving cell populations, affecting also their ecological niche formed by neighboring normal cells and tissues.

This study aims to identify factors that explain the behavioral intention of Wuhan City urban residents to wear masks. METHODS: A theoretical model was extended on UTAUT by incorporating the feature on residents having relevant knowledge and sufficient awareness on the pandemic. During early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, an online survey was conducted in Wuhan City and 728 valid samples were collected from 35 communities. Structural equations modeling and bootstrapping were applied. RESULTS: Sample data present acceptable reliability and validity. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and knowledge about COVID-19 have positive effects on behavioral intention. Facilitating condition, knowledge, and behavioral intention have significant effects on use behavior. Gender, age, education, income, and current marital status are significant moderators in the theoretical model. CONCLUSION: Having relevant knowledge on the pandemic, together with performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating condition, affects behavioral intention and usage behavior of Wuhan residents to wear masks at early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The cause of epididymal stones is unknown, but an infectious agent, the avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV), has been implicated. The goal of this study was to determine if administering the live attenuated AIBV vaccine to male chicks increases the incidence of stones in the epididymal region of the adult rooster. Specific pathogen free (SPF) Leghorn roosters were divided into two groups: a vaccine-free group (n = 7) and a group vaccinated with AIBV (n = 12). The vaccine was administered orally at 2, 4, 10, and 14 wk of age. Blood was drawn weekly to monitor antibodies to AIBV. At 26 wk of age, blood was obtained to determine testosterone concentrations, and reproductive tracts were removed to analyze daily sperm production and to detect epididymal stones. Nine of 12 vaccinated roosters developed stones, whereas those not given the vaccine did not develop stones. Serum testosterone concentrations were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in vaccinated roosters with epididymal stones (3.6 +/- 0.30 ng/ml) when compared with nonvaccinated roosters that did not have epididymal stones (7.0 +/- 1.63 ng/ml). Testis weight was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in vaccinated roosters with epididymal stones (12.1 +/- 0.76 g), as compared with nonvaccinated roosters without epididymal stones (15.2 +/- 0.81 g). Daily sperm production was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in vaccinated roosters with epididymal stones (5.03 +/- 0.31 x 10(8) sperm/testis/day) when compared with nonvaccinated roosters without epididymal stones (7.43 +/- 0.52 x 10(8) sperm/testis/day). Comparing daily sperm production on a per gram basis, vaccinated roosters with epididymal stones had 4.38 +/- 0.14 x 10(7) sperm/g of testis, which was significantly (P < 0.05) smaller than nonvaccinated roosters without epididymal stones, which had 5.17 +/- 0.17 x 10(7) sperm/g of testis.

Another interpretation of this conjecture is that every nice graph G can be turned into a locally irregular multigraph M, i.e., with no two adjacent vertices of the same degree, by replacing each edge by at most three parallel edges. In other words, for every nice graph G, there should exist a locally irregular multigraph M with the same adjacencies and having few edges. We study proper labellings of graphs with the extra requirement that the sum of assigned labels must be as small as possible. That is, given a graph G, we are looking for a locally irregular multigraph [Formula: see text] with the fewest edges possible that can be obtained from G by replacing edges with parallel edges. This problem is quite different from the 1-2-3 Conjecture, as we prove that there is no k such that [Formula: see text] can always be obtained from G by replacing each edge with at most k parallel edges. We investigate several aspects of this problem. We prove that the problem of designing proper labellings with minimum label sum is [Formula: see text]-hard in general, but solvable in polynomial time for graphs with bounded treewidth.

METHODS: The P. aeruginosa-multiple cross displacement amplification (PA-MCDA) assay was conducted at an isothermal temperature during the amplification stage, and products were visually detected by color changes. The entire process was completed within 1 h. A total of 77 strains, including P. aeruginosa species and various other species of non-P. aeruginosa, were used to evaluate PA-MCDA assays. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of suspected VAP patients was examined by the MCDA assay. RESULTS: The MCDA assay exhibited a 100% analytical specificity in detecting PA from all 77 strains, and the limit of detection was as low as 100 fg DNA per reaction. A temperature of 65 °C was recommended as standard during the amplification stage. The agreement between PA-MCDA and bacteria culture was 91.18% (κ = 0.787; p = 0.000) in the identification of P. aeruginosa in BALF from suspected VAP. The PA-MCDA assay showed values of 92.31%, 90.78%, 77.41%, and 97.18% for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, respectively.

The base excision repair pathway is one of the most important cellular protection mechanisms that responds to oxidative DNA damage. Lesion-specific DNA repair enzymes include hOgg1, hMYH, hNTH and hMTH. METHODS: The above lesion-specific DNA repair enzymes were expressed in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) using the pSF91.1 retroviral vector. Cells were exposed to a 95% oxygen environment, ionizing radiation (IR), or H(2)O(2). Cell growth analysis was performed under non-toxic conditions. Western blot analysis was performed to verify over-expression and assess endogenous expression under toxic and non-toxic conditions. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired Student's t test with significance being accepted for p < 0.05. RESULTS: Cell killing assays demonstrated cells over-expressing hMYH had improved survival to both increased oxygen and IR. Cell growth analysis of A549 cells under non-toxic conditions revealed cells over-expressing hMYH also grow at a slower rate. Western blot analysis demonstrated over-expression of each individual gene and did not result in altered endogenous expression of the others. However, it was observed that O(2 )toxicity did lead to a reduced endogenous expression of hNTH in A549 cells. CONCLUSION: Increased expression of the DNA glycosylase repair enzyme hMYH in A549 cells exposed to O(2 )and IR leads to improvements in cell survival.

High energy proton beam therapy commenced in the UK National Health Service in 2018. Heavier charged particles have potential advantages over protons by delivering more dose in the Bragg peak, with a sharper penumbra, lower oxygen dependence and increased biological effectiveness. However, they also require more costly equipment including larger gantries to deliver the treatment. There are significant uncertainties in the modelling of relative biological effectiveness and the effects of the fragmentation tail which can deliver dose beyond the Bragg peak. These effects need to be carefully considered especially in relation to long-term outcomes.In 2019, a group of clinicians, clinical scientists, engineers, physical and life scientists from academia and industry, together with funding agency stakeholders, met to consider how the UK should address new technologies for RT, especially the use of heavier charged particles such as helium and carbon and new modes of delivery such as FLASH and spatially fractionated radiotherapy (SFRT).There was unanimous agreement that the UK should develop a facility for heavier charged particle therapy, perhaps constituting a new National Ion Research Centre to enable research using protons and heavier charged particles. Discussion followed on the scale and features, including which ions should be included, from protons through helium, boron, and lithium to carbon, and even oxygen. The consensus view was that any facility intended to treat patients must be located in a hospital setting while providing dedicated research space for physics, preclinical biology and clinical research with beam lines designed for both in vitro and in vivo research. The facility should to be able to investigate and deliver both ultra-high dose rate FLASH RT and SFRT (GRID, minibeams etc.). Discussion included a number of accelerator design options and whether gantries were required. Other potential collaborations might be exploited, including with space agencies, electronics and global communications industries and the nuclear industry.In preparation for clinical delivery, there may be opportunities to send patients overseas (for 12C or 4He ion therapy) using the model of the National Health Service (NHS) Proton Overseas Programme and to look at potential national clinical trials which include heavier ions, FLASH or SFRT. This could be accomplished under the auspices of NCRI CTRad (National Cancer Research Institute, Clinical and Translational Radiotherapy Research Working Group).The initiative should be a community approach, involving all interested parties with a vision that combines discovery science, a translational research capability and a clinical treatment facility. Barriers to the project and ways to overcome them were discussed.

A PubMed search for the terms “artificial intelligence radiology” demonstrates an exponential increase in publications on this topic in recent years. Despite these impending changes, medical education designed for future radiologists have only recently begun. We present our institution's efforts to address this problem as a model for a successful introductory curriculum into artificial intelligence in radiology titled AI-RADS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The course was based on a sequence of foundational algorithms in AI; these algorithms were presented as logical extensions of each other and were introduced as familiar examples (spam filters, movie recommendations, etc.). Since most trainees enter residency without computational backgrounds, secondary lessons, such as pixel mathematics, were integrated in this progression. Didactic sessions were reinforced with a concurrent journal club highlighting the algorithm discussed in the previous lecture. To circumvent often intimidating technical descriptions, study guides for these papers were produced. Questionnaires were administered before and after each lecture to assess confidence in the material. Surveys were also submitted at each journal club assessing learner preparedness and appropriateness of the article. RESULTS: The course received a 9.8/10 rating from residents for overall satisfaction. With the exception of the final lecture, there were significant increases in learner confidence in reading journal articles on AI after each lecture. Residents demonstrated significant increases in perceived understanding of foundational concepts in artificial intelligence across all mastery questions for every lecture. CONCLUSION: The success of our institution's pilot AI-RADS course demonstrates a workable model of including AI in resident education.",2020-10-16,"Lindqwister, Alexander L.; Hassanpour, Saeed; Lewis, Petra J.; Sin, Jessica M.",Acad Radiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/9822a9968ede85a5e3588f629a2aa0ea7c480eec.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7563580.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1076633220305560; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1076633220305560; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071185/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2020.09.017,222410936.0

Methods: An online, cross-sectional questionnaire among HCWs between December 21, 2020 to January 7, 2021. The outcome variables were HCWs' knowledge and awareness of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 lineage, and its associated travel worry and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score. Results: A total of 1,058 HCWs completed the survey; 66.5% were female, 59.0% were nurses. 9.0% indicated they had been previously diagnosed with COVID-19 themselves. Regarding the B.1.1.7 lineage, almost all (97.3%) were aware of its emergence, 73.8% were aware that it is more infectious, 78.0% thought it causes more severe disease, and only 50.0% knew that current COVID-19 vaccines are effective in preventing it. Despite this, 66.7% of HCWs were not registered to receive the vaccine. HCWs' most common source of information about the new variant was social media platforms (67%), and this subgroup was significantly more worried about travelling. Nurses were more worried than physicians (P=0.001); additionally, those who had not travelled in the previous 3 months and those who had not received or registered for the COVID-19 vaccine were also significantly more worried (P = 0.037 and P < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: Most HCWs were aware of the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant and expressed substantial travel worries. Increased worry levels were found among HCWs who used social media as their main source of information, those with lower levels of COVID-19 vaccine uptake, and those with higher GAD-7 scores.

METHODS: From January 9, 2020, to February 26, 2020, totally 56 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 underwent chest CT. For 40 patients, follow-up CT scans were obtained. The CT images were evaluated for the number, type and distribution of the opacity, and the affected lung lobes. Furthermore, the initial CT scan and the follow-up CT scans were compared. RESULTS: Forty patients (83.6%) had two or more opacities in the lung. Eighteen (32.7%) patients had only ground-glass opacities; twenty-nine patients (52.7%) had ground-glass and consolidative opacities; and eight patients (14.5%) had only consolidation. A total of 43 patients (78.2%) showed two or more lobes involved. The opacities tended to be both in peripheral and central (30/55, 54.5%) or purely peripheral distribution (25/55, 45.5%). Fifty patients (90.9%) had the lower lobe involved. The first follow-up CT scans showed that twelve patients (30%) had improvement, 26 (65%) patients had mild-moderate progression, and two patients (5%) had severe progression with “white lungs.” The second follow-up CT showed that 22 patients (71%) showed improvement compared with the first follow-up CT, four patients (12.9%) had aggravated progression, and five patients (16.1%) showed unchanged radiographic appearance. CONCLUSIONS: The common CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are multiple lung opacities, multiple types of the opacity (ground-glass, ground-glass and consolidation, and consolidation alone), and multiple lobes especially the lower lobe involved. Follow-up CT could demonstrate the rapid progression of COVID-19 pneumonia (either in aggravation or absorption). KEY POINTS: • The predominant CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia are multiple ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation and, with both lungs, multiple lobes and especially the lower lobe affected. • CT plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and assessment of COVID-19 pneumonia progression. • CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia may not be consistent with the clinical symptoms or the initial RT-PCR test results.",2020-05-20,"Fu, Fangfang; Lou, Jianghua; Xi, Deyan; Bai, Yan; Ma, Gongbao; Zhao, Bin; Liu, Dong; Bao, Guofeng; Lei, Zhidan; Wang, Meiyun",Eur Radiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/8bad56a5d23c10949463f473ff1a1de6b1e1866b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7237879.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32435925/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-06920-8,218693597.0

Importantly data indicating trends in food-borne infectious intestinal disease is limited to a few industrialised countries, and even fewer pathogens. It has been predicted that the importance of diarrhoeal disease, mainly due to contaminated food and water, as a cause of death will decline worldwide. Evidence for such a downward trend is limited. This prediction presumes that improvements in the production and retail of microbiologically safe food will be sustained in the developed world and, moreover, will be rolled out to those countries of the developing world increasingly producing food for a global market. In this review evidence is presented to indicate that the microbiological safety of food remains a dynamic situation heavily influenced by multiple factors along the food chain from farm to fork. Sustaining food safety standards will depend on constant vigilance maintained by monitoring and surveillance but, with the rising importance of other food-related issues, such as food security, obesity and climate change, competition for resources in the future to enable this may be fierce. In addition the pathogen populations relevant to food safety are not static. Food is an excellent vehicle by which many pathogens (bacteria, viruses/prions and parasites) can reach an appropriate colonisation site in a new host. Although food production practices change, the well-recognised food-borne pathogens, such as Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli, seem able to evolve to exploit novel opportunities, for example fresh produce, and even generate new public health challenges, for example antimicrobial resistance. In addition, previously unknown food-borne pathogens, many of which are zoonotic, are constantly emerging. Current understanding of the trends in food-borne diseases for bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens has been reviewed. The bacterial pathogens are exemplified by those well-recognized by policy makers; i.e. Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Antimicrobial resistance in several bacterial food-borne pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella and Vibrio spp., methicillin resistant Staphylcoccus aureas, E. coli and Enterococci) has been discussed as a separate topic because of its relative importance to policy issues. Awareness and surveillance of viral food-borne pathogens is generally poor but emphasis is placed on Norovirus, Hepatitis A, rotaviruses and newly emerging viruses such as SARS. Many food-borne parasitic pathogens are known (for example Ascaris, Cryptosporidia and Trichinella) but few of these are effectively monitored in foods, livestock and wildlife and their epidemiology through the food-chain is poorly understood. The lessons learned and future challenges in each topic are debated. It is clear that one overall challenge is the generation and maintenance of constructive dialogue and collaboration between public health, veterinary and food safety experts, bringing together multidisciplinary skills and multi-pathogen expertise. Such collaboration is essential to monitor changing trends in the well-recognised diseases and detect emerging pathogens. It will also be necessary understand the multiple interactions these pathogens have with their environments during transmission along the food chain in order to develop effective prevention and control strategies.",2010-05-30,"Newell, Diane G.; Koopmans, Marion; Verhoef, Linda; Duizer, Erwin; Aidara-Kane, Awa; Sprong, Hein; Opsteegh, Marieke; Langelaar, Merel; Threfall, John; Scheutz, Flemming; der Giessen, Joke van; Kruse, Hilde",International Journal of Food Microbiology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/5b5eee89bf42342044d74bff19d26ef94a3f4e20.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7132498.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168160510000383; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2010.01.021; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168160510000383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20153070/,30709519.0

Our study aims to analyze the outcomes and risk factors from patients treated with ECMO. METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective, single‐center study includes 17 COVID‐19 patients treated with ECMO. Univariate and multivariate parametric survival regression identified predictors of survival. Nine patients (53%) were successfully weaned from ECMO and discharged. The incidence of in‐hospital mortality was 47%. In a univariate analysis, only four out of 83 pre‐ECMO variables were significantly different; IL‐6, PCT, and NT‐proBNP were significantly higher in non‐survivors than in survivors. The Respiratory Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Survival Prediction (RESP) score was significantly higher in survivors. After a multivariate parametric survival regression, IL‐6, NT‐proBNP and RESP scores remained significant independent predictors, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.069 [95%‐CI: 0.986‐1.160], p= 0.016 1.001 [95%‐CI: 1.000‐1.001], p=0.012; and 0.843 [95%‐CI: 0.564‐1.260], p=0.040, respectively.

Crucially, lockdown and confinement measures isolate people who become the first and the only ones in charge of their own mental health: people are left alone facing a novel and potentially lethal situation, and, at the same time, they need to develop adaptive strategies to face it, at home. In this view, easy-to-use, inexpensive, and scientifically validated self-help solutions aiming to reduce the psychological burden of coronavirus are extremely necessary. AIMS: This pragmatic trial aims to provide the evidence that a weekly self-help virtual reality (VR) protocol can help overcome the psychological burden of the Coronavirus by relieving anxiety, improving well-being, and reinforcing social connectedness. The protocol will be based on the “Secret Garden” 360 VR video online (www.covidfeelgood.com) which simulates a natural environment aiming to promote relaxation and self-reflection. Three hundred sixty–degree or spherical videos allow the user to control the viewing direction. In this way, the user can explore the content from any angle like a panorama and experience presence and immersion. The “Secret Garden” video is combined with daily exercises that are designed to be experienced with another person (not necessarily physically together), to facilitate a process of critical examination and eventual revision of core assumptions and beliefs related to personal identity, relationships, and goals. METHODS: This is a multicentric, pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial involving individuals who experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and underwent a lockdown and quarantine procedures. The trial is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano. Each research group in all the countries joining the pragmatic trial, aims at enrolling at least 30 individuals in the experimental group experiencing the self-help protocol, and 30 in the control group, over a period of 3 months to verify the feasibility of the intervention. CONCLUSION: The goal of this protocol is for VR to become the “surgical mask” of mental health treatment. Although surgical masks do not provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection against the coronavirus compared with FFP2 or FFP3 masks, surgical masks are very effective in protecting others from the wearer’s respiratory emissions. The goal of the VR protocol is the same: not necessarily to solve complex mental health problems but rather to improve well-being and preserve social connectedness through the beneficial social effects generated by positive emotions.",2020-09-23,"Riva, Giuseppe; Bernardelli, Luca; Browning, Matthew H.

It still remains a main public health concern at global level and in Arab world mainly in low-income countries. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the Arab world’s growing contribution to global leishmaniasis research. METHODS: This study describes a bibliometric review of all leishmaniasis research publications published between January 1998 and December 2017 indexed on the Scopus database. RESULTS: The total number of publications published at global level was 17,570 papers, which achieves an average annual productivity of 878.50 papers publications. Brazil was responsible for the greatest output with the total number of publications of 3865 followed by the Unites States (n = 2729), India (n = 2119), the United Kingdom (n = 1363), and Spain (n = 1274). By limiting the analysis to the publications that have been published by Arab world, the research productivity was 993 papers, which represents 5.65% of total research output at global level in research regarding leishmaniasis. Tunisia was responsible for the greatest output from Arab world with the total number of publications of 297 followed by Sudan (n = 192), Saudi Arabia (n = 131), Morocco (n = 119) and Egypt (n = 67). Since 1998, the growth of publications on leishmaniasis fluctuates, overall showing a rising trend in both global and Arab world. There is a highly significant correlation between publication productivity related to leishmaniasis at global level and the Arab world (r = 0.936; p-value< 0.001). Leishmaniasis treatment, intracellular mechanism of infection, and lifecycle of leishmania are the major current hot topics for the research in this subject at global level and the Arab world. CONCLUSIONS: The current study presents a novel review of the current Arab leishmaniasis-related research, and how these results are related to worldwide output. In comparison to the global research output, the Arab world produced less leishmaniasis research. The data presented in the current study by this innovative approach may serve relevant researchers to direct the global leishmaniasis research to Arab counties in which leishmaniasis is endemic.",2019-05-22,"Al-Jabi, Samah W.",BMC Public Health,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/43e0f5f9add9380a45d39f55aab2ca96d589280c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6532175.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6532175/,

The aim of this study was to compare the performances of several molecular assays, including conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), two real-time reverse transcription (rRT)-PCRs, and two multiplex RTPCRs. A total of 381 clinical specimens were collected from patients (223 men and 158 women), and both the Seeplex RV7 assay and rRT-PCR were ordered on different specimens within one week after collection. The concordance rate for the two methods was 87% (332/381), and the discrepancy rate was 13% (49/381). The positive rates for the molecular assays studied included 93.1% for the multiplex Seeplex RV7 assay, 93.1% for conventional reverse transcription (cRT)-PCR, 89.7% for the multiplex Seeplex Flu ACE Subtyping assay, 82.8% for protocol B rRT-PCR, and 58.6% for protocol A rRT-PCR. Our results showed that the multiplex Seeplex assays and the cRT-PCR yielded higher detection rates than rRT-PCRs for detecting the influenza A (H1N1) virus. Although the multiplex Seeplex assays had the advantage of simultaneous detection of several viruses, they were time-consuming and troublesome. Our results show that, although rRTPCR had the advantage, the detection rates of the molecular assays varied depending upon the source of the influenza A (H1N1)v virus. Our findings also suggest that rRT-PCR sometimes detected virus in extremely low abundance and thus required validation of analytical performance and clinical correlation.",2012,"Lee, Mi Kyung; Kim, Hye Ryoun",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22713996/,2481606.0

The present study is a first step toward improved understanding of infectious diseases in the species' home regions. Serum samples obtained from 73 red pandas in 10 captive facilities in southwest, east, and northeast China from October to December 2004 were tested for antibodies against nine common infectious pathogens of carnivores. Antibody titers against canine distemper virus (CDV), canine parvovirus (CPV), and canine adenovirus (CAV) in the three facilities in which red pandas were vaccinated were highly variable. The CAV titer in one vaccinated red panda was high enough to suggest infection with the field virus following vaccination. Together with anecdotal reports of vaccine-associated morbidity and mortality, our results suggest that the Chinese vaccine is not suitable for this species. In the seven unvaccinated groups, CDV titers were low and occurred in 20-100% of the animals; antibody titers against CPV were found in seven of eight areas. Only one of 61 and two of 61 unvaccinated red pandas had CAV and canine coronavirus titers, respectively, and these titers were all low. Positive titers to Toxoplasma gondii were found in four locations (33-94% seropositive); the titers in 52% of seropositive individuals were of a magnitude consistent with active disease in other species (1:1,024 to > or = 1:4,096). One red panda in each of three locations was seropositive for Neospora caninum. Antibodies against canine herpesvirus and Brucella canis were not detected in any of the samples.

Thirty‐four patients with root‐filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. In Group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in Group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. The gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. Bacterial DNA was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. The mean number (±SD) of species detected was 33.7±3.3 in Group 1 and 21.3±6.3 in Group 2 (P<0.001). The majority of the probe‐detected bacteria were present in more lesions from Group1 than from Group 2. The differences were most notable for Campylobacter gracilis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Propionibacterium acnes, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola, Streptococcus constellatus and Actinomyces naeslundii I. Bacterial species such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. Also, P. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. The data supported the idea that following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon‐released bacteremia. The study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. The detection of much more bacteria with the “checkerboard” DNA‐DNA hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.",2001-12-24,"Sunde, P.

The objective of this study was to analyze treatment outcomes of this treatment modality. METHODS A retrospective evaluation of prospectively collected data from all patients undergoing TIPP procedure for symptomatic varicose veins during a recent 12-year period was performed. Pertinent patient demographics, disease classification, perioperative complications, quality of life, and treatment outcomes were collected and analyzed. RESULTS A total of 1167 limbs in 1034 patients (mean age, 52.4 years) were treated during the study period. The mean procedure time was 18.4 ± 8.9 minutes (range, 6.0-82.0 minutes). The mean number of incisions for TIPP procedure was 6.3 ± 3.6. All TIPP procedures were technically successful, and no patient required conversion to hook stab phlebectomy. Fifteen (1.5%) patients developed residual or recurrent varicosities, which were treated with sclerotherapy during the follow-up period. Postoperative complications included hematoma at 2 weeks (5.8%), ecchymosis at 2 weeks (32.9%), saphenous neuropathy (0.3%), cellulitis (1.0%), and skin pigmentation (1.9%). There was no postoperative deep vein thrombosis or mortality.

The aim of this study was to report the effectiveness of an essential-oil extract of three Cretan aromatic plants in the treatment of cases with an upper respiratory tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A double blind randomized controlled trial was implemented between October 2013 and February 2014. An essential-oil extract of Cretan aromatic plants in olive oil (total volume of 15 ml of essential oil per litre of olive oil) was administered as 0.5 ml soft gel capsules, twice a day, for 7 days. Placebo treatment was 0.5 ml olive oil in soft gel capsules. Eligible patients were those presenting for clinical examination in the selected setting with signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection that had begun within the previous 24 hours. Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used for the detection of respiratory viruses. The primary outcome was the severity and duration of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, assessed using the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory System Survey (WURSS-21) questionnaire. A secondary outcome of interest was the change in C-reactive protein (CRP) status. RESULTS: One hundred and five patients completed the study: 51 in the placebo group, and 54 in the intervention (treated) group. Baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups. No statistically significant differences were found in symptom duration or severity between the two groups, although small and clinically favorable effects were observed. When the analysis was restricted to subjects with a laboratory-documented viral infection, the percentage of patients with cessation of symptoms after 6 days of treatment was 91% in the intervention group and 70% in the control group (p=0.089). At baseline, one third of the patients in each group had elevated CRP levels. At follow-up, the respective proportions were 0% in the intervention group and 15% in the placebo group (p=0.121). The data were also in a favorable direction when 50% and 80% symptom reduction points were considered for specific virus types.

Materials and methods PDA-XA-NPs were synthesized and characterized using transmission electron microscopy, zeta potential analysis and encapsulation efﬁciency analysis. Their in vitro release kinetics and inhibitory effects on gastric cancer were studied. The adhesion of PDA-XA-NPs was evaluated by in vivo imaging atlas. The pharmacokinetics of PDA-XA-NPs and XA was compared. Results PDA-XA-NPs had a spherical shape, a particle size of about 380 nm, an encapsulation efficiency of (82.1 ± 0.02) % and a drug loading capacity of (5.5 ± 0.1)%. The release of PDA-XA-NPs in PBS was stable and slow, without being affected by pH. The adhesion capacity of PDA-XA-NPs for mucin was significantly higher than that of bulk drug. The gastric mucosal retention of PDA-XA-NPs reached 89.1% which significantly exceeded that of XA. In vivo imaging showed that PDA-XA-NPs targeting the stomach were retained for a period of time. The pharmacokinetics study showed that PDA-XA-NPs had a longer retention time and a slower drug release than those of XA. In vitro experiments confirmed that PDA-XA-NPs exerted similar inhibitory effects on gastric cancer to those of XA, which lasted for a period of time. Conclusion High-adhesion NPs were constructed.

The changing geopolitical landscape has led to its resurgence in recent years. The public rejection of traditional forms of torture that rely on the infliction of physical pain has paradoxically increased the reliance on psychological methods of torture. This critical commentary aims to define and characterize psychological torture (PT) while exploring practical, legal, ethical and therapeutic implications relevant to clinicians and policymakers. Psychological torture comes in a range of forms. It is being increasingly justified and adopted by legitimate authorities in the name of national security. The emphasis on the avoidance of physical pain leads to the assumption that PT does not produce the levels of suffering and harm that are associated with physically violent forms of torture. This same assumption has allowed for the implication of mental health professionals in theorizing and providing legitimacy for the actions of perpetrators. Psychological torture is still poorly defined with limited understanding of its long-term psychiatric impact on those who are subjected to it.

In another example, amygdalin, a by-product of the apricot industry, was used to develop novel amphiphiles, which showed unprecedented gelation properties in a wide range of solvents. To take these soft nanomaterials to a second level, we successfully demonstrated the utility of these hydrogels as drug delivery vehicles.

It is thought that infants may be at higher risk for severe disease than older children. There is a paucity of literature on infants with COVID, particularly those with severe disease. OBJECTIVE: We describe demographic, epidemiologic, clinical, radiological, laboratory features and outcomes of infants with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to a tertiary care teaching hospital in Pune, India. METHODOLOGY: Infants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were admitted between 1 April 2020 and 7 August 2020 were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 13 infants were admitted during the study period. The median age was 8 months (IQR 6) and nine were male. Common presenting features were fever (n = 8, 62%), poor feeding, irritability, and runny nose (n = 3, 23%). Comorbidities noted were severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in three cases (23%) and nutritional megaloblastic anemia, iron deficiency anemia, sickle thalassemia and renal calculi in one case (8%) each. There was a history of low birth weight in two cases (15%). Pallor was noted in three cases (23%), SAM in three cases (23%) and tachypnea and respiratory distress in four cases (30%). Severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated ferritin, abnormal procalcitonin, abnormal C Reactive Protein and deranged D-dimer was noted in three cases (23%) each.

New York City (NYC) represents a unique opportunity to examine the epidemiologic association between the two given the variable regional distribution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in its highly diverse neighborhoods. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the association between OHSD and SARS-CoV-2 epidemiologic burden during the first COVID-19 pandemic across the highly diverse neighborhoods of NYC. METHODS: The incidences of OHSD between March 20 and April 22, 2019, and between March 20 and April 22, 2020, as reported by the Fire Department of New York were obtained. As a surrogate for viral epidemiologic burden, we used percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests performed between March 3 and August 20, 2020. Data were reported separately for the 176 zip codes of NYC. Correlation analysis and regression analysis were performed between the 2 measures to examine association. RESULTS: Incidence of OHSD per 10,000 inhabitants and percentage of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion were highly variable across NYC neighborhoods, varying from 0.0 to 22.9 and 12.4% to 50.9%, respectively. Correlation analysis showed a moderate positive correlation between neighborhood data on OHSD and percentage of positive antibody tests to SARS-CoV-2 (Spearman ρ 0.506; P <.001). Regression analysis showed that seroconversion to SARS-CoV-2 and OHSD in 2019 were independent predictors for OHSD during the first epidemic surge in NYC (R(2) = 0.645).

210562,w0vepn1p,,WHO,Digital technology for management of severe mental disorders in low-income and middle-income countries,,,,unk,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Increasingly, digital technologies, especially mobile telecommunications and smartphone apps, are seen as a novel tool for managing severe mental disorders (SMDs) in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, there is a need to identify best practices in the use of digital technologies to effectively reach, support, and manage care for patients living with SMDs. In this review, we summarize recent studies using digital technology to manage symptoms and support clinical care for this patient population and discuss new opportunities to advance digital psychiatry research and practice in LMICs. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies evaluating digital interventions for clinical populations living with SMDs in LMICs are limited. Yet, across recent articles surveyed, digital technology appears to yield diverse benefits for this at-risk patient population. These benefits include improved medication adherence, appointment adherence, reduced instances of relapse, and fewer re-hospitalizations. SUMMARY: Continued rigorous research evaluating effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of digital technologies in reaching, treating, and managing symptoms and supporting clinical care for patients with SMDs in LMICs is vital. The urgency for remote approaches for delivering specialized psychiatric care is particularly pronounced because of the immediate and long-term impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on access to in-person services. Future research should emphasize participatory approaches rooted in a process of codesign with target users, in order to achieve clinically effective remotely delivered digital mental health interventions.",2020,"Merchant, Rutvij; Torous, John; Rodriguez-Villa, Elena; Naslund, John A",Curr Opin Psychiatry,,#594281,,,,,219588778.0

Our aim was to provide a morphologic classification that reflects hemorrhage rates. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively categorized 355 cavernous malformations of 70 children and adolescents according to their morphologic appearance on MR imaging and calculated prospective hemorrhage rates on the basis of survival functions for 255 lesions in 25 patients with a radiologic observation period of >180 days. RESULTS Overall, there were 199 MR imaging examinations with 1558 distinct cavernous malformation observations during a cumulative observation period of 1094.2 lesion-years. The mean hemorrhage rate of all 355 cavernous malformations was 4.5% per lesion-year. According to Kaplan-Meier survival models, Zabramski type I and II cavernous malformations had a significantly higher hemorrhage rate than type III and IV lesions. The presence of acute or subacute blood-degradation products was the strongest indicator for an increased hemorrhage risk (P = .036, Cox regression): The mean annual hemorrhage rate and mean hemorrhage-free interval for cavernous malformations with and without signs of acute or subacute blood degradation products were 23.4% and 22.6 months and 3.4% and 27.9 months, respectively. Dot-sized cavernous malformations, visible in T2* and not or barely visible in T1WI and T2WI sequences, had a mean annual hemorrhage rate of 1.3% and a mean hemorrhage-free interval of 37.8 months.

Most children can immunologically contain or eradicate the organism without pathology developing. However, in a minority, the organism overcomes the immunological constraints, proliferates and causes TB disease. Each year a million children develop TB disease, with a quarter dying. While it is known that young children and those with immunodeficiencies are at increased risk of progression from TB infection to TB disease, our understanding of risk factors for this transition is limited. The most immunologically disruptive process that can happen during childhood is infection with another pathogen and yet the impact of co-infections on TB risk is poorly investigated. Many diseases have overlapping geographical distributions to TB and affect similar patient populations. It is therefore likely that infection with viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa may impact on the risk of developing TB disease following exposure and infection, although disentangling correlation and causation is challenging. As vaccinations also disrupt immunological pathways, these may also impact on TB risk. In this article we describe the pediatric immune response to M. tuberculosis and then review the existing evidence of the impact of co-infection with other pathogens, as well as vaccination, on the host response to M. tuberculosis. We focus on the impact of other organisms on the risk of TB disease in children, in particularly evaluating if co-infections drive host immune responses in an age-dependent way. We finally propose priorities for future research in this field.

Although medical institutions were the most identifiable sources of MERS transmission in South Korea, similar to other countries, in-depth epidemiological investigation was required for some confirmed cases with indefinite contact history or hospital visit records. The subject of epidemiological investigation in the present study was a 35 year-old male patient diagnosed with MERS (#119) who lived in Asan-city and worked in Pyeongtaek-city. Various potential sources of transmission were carefully investigated. While he could have been exposed to MERS through a friend from Saudi Arabia or confirmed MERS cases in his workplace, neighboring areas, and medical institutions, as well as contacts in his home, the chances of transmission were low; however, the potential for transmission through his local community could not be excluded.

GBS is a neurological emergency defined as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The patient responded to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 44-year-old Hispanic man who came for evaluation of bilateral facial weakness and lack of taste sensation. He had lower motor neuron facial weakness. His head computed tomography and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans did not show any pathological abnormalities. He tested positive for SARSCoV-2 by a nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis via lumbar puncture revealed elevated protein levels, no leukocytes, and a negative Gram stain. The CSF RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was negative. PCR tests of the CSF for other viral infections were negative. A diagnosis of GBS was made, and he was treated successfully with IVIG. After the fourth dose of IVIG, the patient was able to close his eyes, frown, show his teeth, and smile. CONCLUSIONS: Our case is rare because the patient did not present with lower extremity weakness, but only with bilateral Bell’s palsy. Physicians should be aware of GBS because it is a neurological emergency for which COVID-19 can be a risk factor. Early diagnosis and treatment of GBS can prevent neurological disability.",2020-10-31,"Khaja, Misbahuddin; Roa Gomez, Gabriella P.; Santana, Yaneidy; Hernandez, Nolberto; Haider, Asim; Lara, Jose Luis Perez; Elkin, Rene",Am J Case Rep,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/799a5806a386a91c1e83d8622cb0d998e9e03ba7.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7643409.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.927956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33128540/,224979295.0

The feasibility of minimally invasive single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) for colorectal procedures is well-established, but outcome data remain limited. METHODS Patients with benign diverticular disease, Crohn's disease, or ulcerative colitis admitted to Klinikum Leverkusen, Germany, for colonic resection between July 2009 and March 2011 (n = 224) underwent single-incision laparoscopic surgery using the SILS port system. Surgeons had ≥7 years' experience in laparoscopic colon surgery but no SILS experience. Patient demographic and clinical data were collected prospectively. Pain was evaluated by using a visual analog scale (0-10). Data were analyzed by using the SPSS PASW Statistics 18 database. RESULTS The majority of patients underwent sigmoid colectomy with high anterior resection (AR) or left hemicolectomy (n = 150) for diverticulitis. Our conversion rate to open surgery was 6.3 %, half in patients undergoing sigmoid colectomy with high AR or left hemicolectomy, 95 % of whom had diverticulitis. Mean operating time was 166 ± 74 (range, 40-441) min in the overall population, with shorter times for single-port transanal tumor resection (SPTTR; 89 ± 51 min; range, 40-153 min) and longer times for proctocolectomy (325 min; range, 110-441 min). Mean hospital stay was approximately 10 days, longer after abdominoperineal rectal resection or proctocolectomy (12-16 days). Most complications occurred following sigmoid colectomy with high AR or left hemicolectomy [19/25 (76 %) of early and 4/5 (80 %) of late complications, respectively]. Pain was <4 on a scale of 0-10 in all cases on postoperative day 1, and typically decreased during the next 2 days.

The insertion of a foreign material usually elicits inflammation, which can result in hampered antimicrobial capacity of the host immunity due to the effort of immune cells being directed to degrade the material. The ineffective clearance by immune cells is a perfect opportunity for bacteria to attach and form a biofilm. In this study, we analyzed the antibiofilm capacity of three naturally derived biofilm inhibitors when combined with immune cells in order to assess their applicability in implantable titanium devices and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) endotracheal tubes. To this end, we used a system based on the coculture of HL-60 cells differentiated into polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) and Staphylococcus aureus (laboratory and clinical strains) on titanium, as well as LDPE surfaces. Out of the three inhibitors, the one coded DHA1 showed the highest potential to be incorporated into implantable devices, as it displayed a combined activity with the immune cells, preventing bacterial attachment on the titanium and LDPE.

In theory, tocilizumab and favipiravir are considered to be reliable drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 with elevated IL-6. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab combined with favipiravir in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a multicenter trial in adults with COVID-19. Patients were randomly assigned (3:1:1) to a 14-day combination of favipiravir combined with tocilizumab (combination group), favipiravir, and tocilizumab. The primary outcome was the cumulative lung lesion remission rate (lung CT examination indicated absorption of lung inflammation). RESULTS: Between Feb 2 and March 15, 2020, 26 patients were recruited; 14 were randomly assigned to the combination group, 7 were assigned to the favipiravir group and 5 were assigned to the tocilizumab group. The cumulative lung lesion remission rate at day 14 was significantly higher in combination group as compared with favipiravir group (P = 0.019, HR 2.66 95 % CI [1.08-6.53]). And there was also a significant difference between tocilizumab and favipivavir (P = 0.034, HR 3.16, 95 % CI 0.62-16.10). In addition, there was no significant difference between the combination group and the tocilizumab group (P = 0.575, HR 1.28 95 %CI 0.39-4.23).

To gain insight into the regulatory mechanisms involved in encapsulation of a foreign object, and subsequent differentiation of encapsulating cells, the present study used microarray technology and real-time RT-PCR to identify the temporal changes in gene expression associated with tissue development. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that 3-7 days post-implantation of foreign objects (cubes of boiled egg white) into rats, they were encapsulated by tissue comprised primarily of haemopoietic (CD45(+)) cells, mainly macrophages (CD68(+), CCR1(+)). By day 14, tissue capsule cells no longer expressed CD68, but were positive for myofibroblast markers alpha-smooth muscle (SM) actin and SM22. In accordance with these results, gene expression data showed that early capsule (days 3-7) development was dominated by the expression of monocyte/macrophage-specific genes (CD14, CSF-1, CSF-1R, MCP-1) and pro-inflammatory mediators such as transforming growth factor (TGF-beta). As tissue capsule development progressed (days 14-21), myofibroblast-associated and pro-fibrotic genes (associated with TGF-beta and Wnt/beta-catenin signalling pathways, including Wnt 4, TGFbetaRII, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), SMADs-1, -2, -4 and collagen-1 subunits) were significantly up-regulated. The up-regulation of genes associated with Cardiovascular and Skeletal and Muscular System Development at later time-points suggests the capacity of cells within the tissue capsule for further differentiation to smooth muscle, and possibly other cell types.

However, whether bridging therapy (pretreatment with intravenous thrombolysis before MT) provides additional benefits in patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effects of direct MT and bridging therapy, and to elucidate the correlation between thrombus composition and stroke subtypes. Seventy-three patients with acute ischemic stroke who received MT, were eligible for intravenous thrombolysis, and had MCA occlusion were included. We matched 21 direct MT patients with 21 bridging therapy patients using propensity score matching and compared their 3rd-month clinical outcomes. All MCA thrombi (n = 45) were histologically analyzed, and the red blood cell (RBC) and fibrin percentages were quantified. We compared the clot composition according to stroke etiology (large-artery atherosclerosis and cardioembolism) and intravenous thrombolysis application. The baseline characteristics showed no difference between groups except for a higher atrial fibrillation rate and NIHSS score on admission in the direct MT group. We performed a supportive analysis using propensity score matching but could not find any differences in the functional outcome, mortality, and intracerebral hemorrhage. In the histological clot analysis, the cardioembolic clots without intravenous thrombolysis pretreatment had higher RBC (P = 0.042) and lower fibrin (P = 0.042) percentages than the large-artery atherosclerosis thrombi. Similar findings were observed in the thrombi treated with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (P = 0.012). In conclusion, there was no difference in the functional outcomes between the direct MT and bridging therapy groups. However, randomized trials are needed to elucidate the high ratio of cardioembolism subtype in our group of patients. The histological MCA thrombus composition differed between cardioembolism and large-artery atherosclerosis, and this finding provides valuable information on the underlying pathogenesis and thrombus origin.",2019,"Gong, Li; Zheng, Xiaoran; Feng, Lijin; Zhang, Xiang; Dong, Qiong; Zhou, Xiaoyu; Wang, Haichao; Zhang, Xiaojun; Shu, Zhongwen; Zhao, Yanxin; Liu, Xueyuan",Cell transplantation,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/0963689718823206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30654640/,58556137.0

Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) is considered a mainstream procedure for treating both wound types. Soft tissue deformation stimuli are the crux of NPWT, enhancing cell proliferation and migration from peri-wound tissues which contributes to healing. We developed a dynamic stretching device (DSD) contained in a miniature incubator for applying controlled deformations to fibroblast wound assays. Prior to the stretching experiments, fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well culture plates with elastic substrata and let to reach confluency. Squashing damage was then induced at the culture centers, and the DSD was activated to deliver stretching regimes that represented common clinical NPWT protocols at two peak strain levels, 0.5% and 3%. Analyses of the normalized maximal migration rate (MMR) data for the collective cell movement revealed that for the 3% strain level, the normalized MMR of cultures subjected to a 0.1 Hz stretch frequency regime was ~ 1.4 times and statistically significantly greater (p < 0.05) than that of the cultures subjected to no-stretch (control) or to static stretch (2nd control). Correspondingly, analysis of the time to gap closure data indicated that the closure time of the wound assays subjected to the 0.1 Hz regime was ~ 30% shorter than that of the cultures subjected to the control regimes (p < 0.05).

Therefore, they should have the essential competencies for approaching patients. Aims The study aimed to identify essential competencies required for approaching patients with COVID-19. Methods All postgraduate health professionals at the Syrian Virtual University SVU (n=28) were invited to participate in the study during the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020, resulting in 20 postgraduates accepting. The Delphi technique was adopted for identifying competencies in medical education and a virtual meeting was undertaken through the University Management System in order to provide instruction and create a list of competencies. Competency domains were divided into 'knowledge', 'skills', and 'attitudes' and were classified into four categories: etiology, assessment and diagnosis, management, and prognosis. Results Fifty-two essential competencies were identified; 7 competencies on etiology, 7 related to assessment and diagnosis, 34 related to management, and 4 related to prognosis. Conclusion It is hoped that the identified competencies would help health professionals to deliver the best health care for COVI-19 patients, as well as help policy-makers to support comprehensive training programmes that can equip health professionals with the required competencies to fight the pandemic.",2020-09-24,"Dashash, Mayssoon; Almasri, Bashar; Takaleh, Eman; Halawah, Alaa Abou; Sahyouni, Amal",Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.26719/emhj.20.111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33047791/,222317188.0

We compared one such assay, the PLx Multi-Code Respiratory Virus Panel (PLx-RVP), manufactured by Eragen Biosciences, Inc. (Madison, WI), with conventional virologic testing, consisting of fluorescent-antibody staining plus testing with the R-mix system and fibroblast tube cultures. The test set consisted of 410 archived respiratory specimens, mostly nasopharyngeal swabs, including 210 that had been positive by conventional testing for a balanced selection of common respiratory viruses. Specimens yielding discrepant results were evaluated using a panel of respiratory virus PCR assays developed, characterized, and validated with clinical specimens. PLx-RVP increased the total rate of detection of viruses by 35.8%, and there was a 25.7% increase in the rate of detection of positive specimens. Reference PCR assay results corroborated the PLx-RVP result for 54 (82%) of 66 discrepancies with conventional testing. Of the 12 specimens with discrepancies between PLx-RVp and the reference PCRs, 6 were positive for rhinovirus by PLx-RVP and the presence of rhinovirus was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The remaining six specimens included five in which the PLx-RVP failed to detect parainfluenza virus and one in which the detection of influenza A virus by PLx-RVP could not be confirmed by the reference PCR. Taking the results of the reference PCR assay results into account, the sensitivities of the PLx-RVP for individual viruses ranged from 94 to 100% and the specificities ranged from 99 to 100%. We conclude that PLx-RVP is a highly accurate system for the detection of respiratory viruses and significantly improves the rate of detection of these viruses compared to that by conventional virologic testing.",2010,"Arens, Max Q; Buller, Richard S; Rankin, Anne; Mason, Sheila; Whetsell, Amy; Agapov, Eugene; Lee, Wai-Ming; Storch, Gregory A",Journal of clinical microbiology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00220-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20484608/,19979100.0

In April-May 2020, state governments started political discussions about whether it would be worth the risk to reduce protective measures. In a highly politicized environment, risk perceptions and preferences for risk mitigation may vary by political inclinations. In April-May 2020, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of 5517 members of the University of Southern California's Understanding America Study. Of those, 37% identified as Democrats, 32% as Republican, and 31% as Third Party/Independent. Overall, Democrats perceived more risk associated with COVID-19 than Republicans, including for getting infected, being hospitalized and dying if infected, as well as running out of money as a result of the pandemic. Democrats were also more likely than Republicans to express concerns that states would lift economic restrictions too quickly, and to report mask use and social distancing. Generally, participants who identified as Third Party/Independent fell in between. Democrats were more likely to report watching MSNBC or CNN (vs. not), while Republicans were more likely to report watching Fox News (vs. not), and Third Party/Independents tended to watch neither. However, political inclinations predicted reported policy preferences, mask use, and social distancing, in analyses that accounted for differences in use of media sources, risk perceptions, and demographic background. In these analyses, participants' reported media use added to the partisan divide in preferences for the timing of lifting economic restrictions and reported protective behaviors.

We find that both human and sylvatic (reservoir) dengue viruses universally cleave human STING, but not the STING of primates implicated as reservoir species. The special ability of dengue to cleave STING is thus specific to humans and a few closely related ape species. Conversion of residues 78/79 to the human-encoded ‘RG’ renders all primate (and mouse) STINGs sensitive to viral cleavage.

Study design: Interviews using the validated American Academy of Pediatrics 2-question food insecurity screen were performed with 200 consecutive families presenting for pediatric care to 2 FQHC in Central Texas from April 14 to May 20, 2020, during the initial phase of the pandemic in Texas. Brief qualitative interviews were conducted to determine whether families found a worsening of food insecurity during the pandemic. Results: Overall, 47% of families had a positive food insecurity screen. More than 90% of these were worrying about food running out and about 60% were positive for the question related to food not lasting. Among families with food insecurity, 94% indicated this had begun or worsened during the pandemic. Of the 115 families volunteering information about employment, 46% reported job loss during this time period. Both ethnicity (P &lt; .001) and Special Supplementation Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) participation (P = .03) were associated with greater levels of food insecurity. Among primarily Spanish-speaking families participating in the WIC program, 64% reported food insecurity. Conclusions: Approximately one-half of families receiving routine pediatric care at a FQHC during the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic reported food insecurity and this was associated with loss of jobs during the pandemic. Participation in the WIC program was not protective against food insecurity. Increased frequency of food insecurity was detected in Hispanic and Spanish-speaking families. Screening of families at an FQHC should be strongly considered as a part of routine pediatric care. Knowledge of community resources is important for providers to share with patients.

Unfortunately, the majority of patients treated with AIs eventually develop resistance, inevitably resulting in patient relapse and, ultimately, death. The mechanism by which resistance occurs is still not completely known, however, recent studies suggest that impaired/defective interferon signaling might play a role. In the present study, we assessed the functional role of IFITM1 and PLSCR1; two well-known interferon response genes in AI resistance. METHODS: Real-time PCR and Western blot analyses were used to assess mRNA and protein levels of IFITM1, PLSCR1, STAT1, STAT2, and IRF-7 in AI-resistant MCF-7:5C breast cancer cells and AI-sensitive MCF-7 and T47D cells. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining was performed on tissue microarrays consisting of normal breast tissues, primary breast tumors, and AI-resistant recurrence tumors. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantitate intracellular IFNα level. Neutralizing antibody was used to block type 1 interferon receptor IFNAR1 signaling. Small interference RNA (siRNA) was used to knockdown IFITM1, PLSCR1, STAT1, STAT2, IRF-7, and IFNα expression. RESULTS: We found that IFITM1 and PLSCR1 were constitutively overexpressed in AI-resistant MCF-7:5C breast cancer cells and AI-resistant tumors and that siRNA knockdown of IFITM1 significantly inhibited the ability of the resistant cells to proliferate, migrate, and invade. Interestingly, suppression of IFITM1 significantly enhanced estradiol-induced cell death in AI-resistant MCF-7:5C cells and markedly increased expression of p21, Bax, and Noxa in these cells. Significantly elevated level of IFNα was detected in AI-resistant MCF-7:5C cells compared to parental MCF-7 cells and suppression of IFNα dramatically reduced IFITM1, PLSCR1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 expression in the resistant cells. Lastly, neutralizing antibody against IFNAR1/2 and knockdown of STAT1/STAT2 completely suppressed IFITM1, PLSCR1, p-STAT1, and p-STAT2 expression in the resistant cells, thus confirming the involvement of the canonical IFNα signaling pathway in driving the overexpression of IFITM1 and other interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the resistant cells. CONCLUSION: Overall, these results demonstrate that constitutive overexpression of ISGs enhances the progression of AI-resistant breast cancer and that suppression of IFITM1 and other ISGs sensitizes AI-resistant cells to estrogen-induced cell death.

This drug is associated with a wide range of side effects, mainly anemia, so its use in patients with potential respiratory affectation could not be appropriate. The evidences of adverse events associated with RBV-use has mainly been derived in the context of hepatitis C (HCV) treatment, however the possible use of RBV in CoVID-19 patients could be limited to 14 days. Methods: Longitudinal study including HIV/HCV coinfected patients. We evaluate the hemoglobin dynamics and reductions as well as evaluate the development rate of anemia during the first 2 weeks of therapy in HCV infected patients. Results: 189 patients were included in the study. The median hemoglobin levels were 14.6 g/dL (IQR: 13.2-15.6 g/dL) and 13.5 g/dL (IQR: 12.3-14.5 g/dL) at weeks 1 and 2 of therapy, respectively. A cumulative number of 27 (14.2%) patients developed anemia (23 grade 1 [12.1%] and 4 grade 2 [2.1%]). We identify a baseline hemoglobin levels of 14 g/dL as the better cut-off to identify those patients with a high chance to develop anemia. Of the 132 patients with baseline hemoglobin level >14 g/dL, 8 developed anemia (6.1%) compared with 19 of 57 (33.3%) with hemoglobin levels lower than 14 g/dL (p < 0.001).

Knowledge of local variation in levels of HIV infection is important for prioritization of areas for intervention. We apply two spatial analytical techniques to investigate the micro-geographical patterns and clustering of HIV infections in a high prevalence, rural population in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. METHODS All 12,221 participants who consented to an HIV test in a population under continuous demographical surveillance were linked to their homesteads and geo-located in a geographical information system (accuracy of <2 m). We then used a two-dimensional Gaussian kernel of radius 3 km to produce robust estimates of HIV prevalence that vary across continuous geographical space. We also applied a Kulldorff spatial scan statistic (Bernoulli model) to formally identify clusters of infections (P < 0.05). RESULTS The results reveal considerable geographical variation in local HIV prevalence (range = 6-36%) within this relatively homogenous population and provide clear empirical evidence for the localized clustering of HIV infections. Three high-risk, overlapping spatial clusters [Relative Risk (RR) = 1.34-1.62] were identified by the Kulldorff statistic along the National Road (P < or = 0.01), whereas three low risk clusters (RR = 0.2-0.38) were identified elsewhere in the study area (P < or = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS The findings show the existence of several localized HIV epidemics of varying intensity that are partly contained within geographically defined communities.

Like SARS-CoV, some bat SL-CoVs, such as WIV1, also use angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from human and bat as entry receptor. However, whether these viruses can also use the ACE2 of other animal species as their receptor remains to be determined. We report herein that WIV1 has a broader tropism to ACE2 orthologs than SARS-CoV isolate Tor2. Among the 9 ACE2 orthologs examined, human ACE2 exhibited the highest efficiency to mediate the infection of WIV1 pseudotyped virus. Our findings thus imply that WIV1 has the potential to infect a wide range of wild animals and may directly jump to humans. We also showed that cell entry of WIV1 could be restricted by interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs). However, WIV1 could exploit the airway protease TMPRSS2 to partially evade the IFITM3 restriction. Interestingly, we also found that amphotericin B could enhance the infectious entry of SARS-CoVs and SL-CoVs by evading IFITM3-mediated restriction. Collectively, our findings further underscore the risk of exposure to animal SL-CoVs and highlight the vulnerability of patients who take amphotericin B to infection by SL-CoVs, including the most recently emerging (SARS-CoV-2).",2020-07-09,"Zheng, Mei; Zhao, Xuesen; Zheng, Shuangli; Chen, Danying; Du, Pengcheng; Li, Xinglin; Jiang, Dong; Guo, Ju-Tao; Zeng, Hui; Lin, Hanxin",Emerging microbes & infections,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/aaefff97cf1588a6ea8cd6e382fe5be4da3a5cb5.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7473123.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1787797; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602823/,220271785.0

Recent studies from North America suggest that disease transmission from commercially reared bumble bees to wild populations has led to marked range contractions in some species. In Europe, data on the prevalence of pathogen spillover from commercial to wild bumble bee populations is lacking, despite the widespread production and transport of hives within the EU since the early 1980s. We determined the permeability of cropping systems to commercial bumble bees, and quantified the prevalence of four pathogens in commercial Bombus terrestris hives and adjacent conspecific populations at increasing distances from greenhouses in Ireland. Commercial bumble bees collected from 31% to 97% of non-crop pollen, depending on the cropping system, and hives had markedly higher frequencies of two gut parasites, Crithidia spp. and Nosema bombi, compared to adjacent populations, but were free of tracheal mites. The highest prevalence of Crithida was observed within 2 km of greenhouses and the probability of infection declined in a host sex- and pathogen-specific manner up to 10 km.

Ninety fecal samples from calves with diarrhea, 81 samples from adult cows with diarrhea (winter dysentery), and 20 fecal samples from healthy adult cows were tested for group C rotaviruses by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immune electron microscopy, and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Three samples from adult cow diarrhea cases were positive only by RT-PCR, and a group C rotavirus was isolated from a positive sample in monkey kidney (MA104) cells (WD534tc/C). Genetically and serologically, the WD534tc/C strain was more closely related to the Cowden porcine group C strain than to the Shintoku bovine strain. Because the original cow feces also contained a group A rotavirus (detected after passage in cell culture), we hypothesized that such dual-rotavirus infections might play a role in the pathogenesis and host adaptation of rotaviruses. Thus, we examined the pathogenesis of WD534tc/C alone or combined with virulent (IND/A) or attenuated (NCDV/A) bovine group A rotaviruses in gnotobiotic calves. WD534tc/C alone induced diarrhea without (or with limited) virus shedding in inoculated calves (n = 3). In contrast, all calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A (n = 2) developed diarrhea and shed both viruses, whereas calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and NCDV/A (n = 3) developed diarrhea but did not shed either virus. Infection with WD534tc/C or NCDV/A alone caused only mild villous atrophy (jejunum and/or ileum), whereas dual infection with both viruses induced lesions throughout the small intestine. Although IND/A alone caused villous atrophy, more-widespread small intestinal lesions occurred in calves coinfected with WD534tc/C and IND/A. In conclusion, coinfection of calves with group A rotaviruses enhanced fecal shedding of a bovine group C rotavirus and the extent of histopathological lesions in the small intestines.

The technical difficulty and risk factor for postoperative complication in LAC are thought to be influenced by visceral obesity. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the impact of visceral fat on the surgical outcomes of LAC. METHODS Between April 2005 and December 2010, consecutive patients with preoperatively diagnosed colon cancer, excluding medium and low rectal cancer, who underwent LAC, were enrolled. Their visceral fat area (VFA) and body mass index (BMI) were prospectively collected. The VFA was assessed by Fat Scan software. The patients were classified into two groups as follows: VFA nonobese with VFA <100 cm(2) (VNO) and VFA obese with VFA ≧100 cm(2) (VO).

199030,2eb4tbez,,WHO,A novel circular RNA hsa_circ_0060927 may serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker for human colorectal cancer,,,,unk,"CYP24A1 plays a role in strictly regulated vitamin D metabolism pathway and has been nominated as a prognostic biomarker for colorectal cancer (CRC). Increasing evidence suggests that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in cancer initiation and progression; however, their diagnostic values in cancers as the new potential biomarkers are still not fully understood. In the present study, by using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), we demonstrated that CYP24A1 and hsa_circ_0060927 were only transcribed in 33 and 25 out of 83 CRC tissues, respectively. In these samples, we demonstrated that CYP24A1 was up-regulated in both linear and circular forms (P < 0.05). Furthermore, we showed that CYP24A1and hsa_circ_0060927 transcription were induced after vitamin D treatment in HCT-116 and HT-29 colon cancer cell lines. Importantly, analysis of the ROC curve in expressed samples indicated that CYP24A1 and hsa_circ_0060927 could serve as the potential diagnostic markers of CRC, but due to the fact that these transcripts are not expressed in many samples, the diagnostic role of these transcripts could be rejected. Taken together, for the first time, the results of our study illustrated the expression levels hsa_circ_0060927 in CRC; however, further studies are required to validate the present results.",2020,"Sadeghi, Hossein; Heiat, Mohammad",Mol.

Our objective was to assess the validity of the HbA1c diagnostic cutpoint of 6.5% based upon published evidence of the prevalence of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy as markers of diabetes. METHODS Data Sources PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus and CINAHL from 1990-March 2019, grey literature sources. Study Selection All studies reported after 1990 (to ensure standardized HbA1c values) where HbA1c levels were presented in relation to prevalence of retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy in subjects not known to have diabetes. Data Extraction Studies were screened independently, data abstracted, and risk of bias appraised. Data Synthesis Data were synthesized using HbA1c categories of < 6.0% (< 42 mmol/mol), 6.0-6.4% (42-47 mmol/mol) and ≥ 6.5% (≥ 48 mmol/mol). Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy prevalence stratified by HbA1c categories. Random-effects multivariable meta-regression was conducted to identify predictors of retinopathy prevalence and sources of between-study heterogeneity. RESULTS Pooled mean prevalence was: 4.0%(95% CI: 3.2-5.0%) for retinopathy, 10.5% (95% CI: 4.0-19.5%) for nephropathy, 2.5% (95% CI: 1.1-4.3%) for neuropathy. Mean prevalence when stratified for HbA1c < 6.0%, 6.0-6.4% and ≥ 6.5% was: retinopathy: 3.4% (95% CI: 1.8-5.4%), 2.3% (95% CI: 1.6-3.2%) and 7.8%(95% CI: 5.7-10.3%); nephropathy: 7.1% (95% CI: 1.7-15.9%), 9.6% (95% CI: 0.8-26.4%) and 17.1% (95% CI: 1.0-46.9%); neuropathy: 2.1% (95% CI: 0.0-6.8%), 3.4% (95% CI: 0.0-11.6%) and 2.8% (95% CI: 0.0-12.8%). Multivariable meta-regression showed HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (OR: 4.05; 95% CI: 1.92-8.57%), age > 55 (OR: 3.23; 95% CI 1.81-5.77), and African-American race (OR: 10.73; 95% CI: 4.34-26.55), to be associated with higher retinopathy prevalence. Marked heterogeneity in prevalence estimates was found across all meta-analyses (Cochran's Q-statistic p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of nephropathy and moderate retinopathy was increased in subjects with HbA1c values ≥ 6.5% confirming the high specificity of this value for diagnosing T2DM; however, at HbA1c < 6.5% retinopathy increased at age > 55 years and, most strikingly, in African-Americans, suggesting there may be excess microvascular complication prevalence (particularly nephropathy) in individuals below the diabetes diagnostic threshold.",2020-11-03,"Butler, Alexandra E; English, Emma; Kilpatrick, Eric S; Östlundh, Linda; Chemaitelly, Hiam S; Abu-Raddad, Laith J; Alberti, K George M M; Atkin, Stephen L; John, W Garry",Acta diabetologica,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00592-020-01606-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141338/,226239881.0

This study presents an analysis of the excess mortality across the 107 Italian provinces, stratified by sex, age group and period of the outbreak. METHODS: The analysis was performed using a two-stage interrupted time-series design using daily mortality data for the period January 2015-May 2020. In the first stage, we performed province-level quasi-Poisson regression models, with smooth functions to define a baseline risk while accounting for trends and weather conditions and to flexibly estimate the variation in excess risk during the outbreak. Estimates were pooled in the second stage using a mixed-effects multivariate meta-analysis. RESULTS: In the period 15 February-15 May 2020, we estimated an excess of 47 490 [95% empirical confidence intervals (eCIs): 43 984 to 50 362] deaths in Italy, corresponding to an increase of 29.5% (95% eCI: 26.8 to 31.9%) from the expected mortality. The analysis indicates a strong geographical pattern, with the majority of excess deaths occurring in northern regions, where few provinces experienced increases up to 800% during the peak in late March. There were differences by sex, age and area both in the overall impact and in its temporal distribution. CONCLUSION: This study offers a detailed picture of excess mortality during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. The strong geographical and temporal patterns can be related to the implementation of lockdown policies and multiple direct and indirect pathways in mortality risk.",2020,"Scortichini, Matteo; Schneider Dos Santos, Rochelle; De039,; Donato, Francesca; De Sario, Manuela; Michelozzi, Paola; Davoli, Marina; Masselot, Pierre; Sera, Francesco; Gasparrini, Antonio",Int. j. epidemiol,,#857629,,,,,220714486.0

This study was aimed to determine the role of stimulator of IFN genes (STING), an essential regulator to innate immunity, in the context of SAH. METHODS: A total of 344 male C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to endovascular perforation to develop a model of SAH. Selective STING antagonist C-176 and STING agonist CMA were administered at 30 min or 1 h post-modeling separately. To investigate the underlying mechanism, the AMPK inhibitor compound C was administered intracerebroventricularly at 30 min before surgery. Post-SAH assessments included SAH grade, neurological test, brain water content, western blotting, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence. Oxygenated hemoglobin was introduced into BV2 cells to establish a SAH model in vitro. RESULTS: STING was mainly distributed in microglia, and microglial STING expression was significantly increased after SAH. Administration of C-176 substantially attenuated SAH-induced brain edema and neuronal injury. More importantly, C-176 significantly alleviated both short-term and persistent neurological dysfunction after SAH. Meanwhile, STING agonist CMA remarkably exacerbated neuronal injury and deteriorated neurological impairments. Mechanically, STING activation aggravated neuroinflammation via promoting microglial activation and polarizing into M1 phenotype, evidenced by microglial morphological changes, as well as the increased level of microglial M1 markers including IL-1ß, iNOS, IL-6, TNF-&#945;, MCP-1, and NLRP3 inflammasome, while C-176 conferred a robust anti-inflammatory effect. However, all the mentioned beneficial effects of C-176 including alleviated neuroinflammation, attenuated neuronal injury and the improved neurological function were reversed by AMPK inhibitor compound C. Meanwhile, the critical role of AMPK signal in C-176 mediated anti-inflammatory effect was also confirmed in vitro. CONCLUSION: Microglial STING yielded neuroinflammation after SAH, while pharmacologic inhibition of STING could attenuate SAH-induced inflammatory injury at least partly by activating AMPK signal.

Due to unavailability of specific drugs, early detection of (COVID-19) patients is essential for disease cure and control. There is a vital need to detect the disease at early stage and instantly quarantine the infected people. Many research have been going on, however, none of them introduces satisfactory results yet. In spite of its simplicity, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier has proven high flexibility in complex classification problems. However, it can be easily trapped. In this paper, a new COVID-19 diagnose strategy is introduced, which is called COVID-19 Patients Detection Strategy (CPDS). The novelty of CPDS is concentrated in two contributions. The first is a new hybrid feature selection Methodology (HFSM), which elects the most informative features from those extracted from chest Computed Tomography (CT) images for COVID-19 patients and non COVID-19 peoples. HFSM is a hybrid methodology as it combines evidence from both wrapper and filter feature selection methods. It consists of two stages, namely; Fast Selection Stage (FS(2)) and Accurate Selection Stage (AS(2)). FS(2)relies on filter, while AS(2) uses Genetic Algorithm (GA) as a wrapper method. As a hybrid methodology, HFSM elects the significant features for the next detection phase. The second contribution is an enhanced K-Nearest Neighbor (EKNN) classifier, which avoids the trapping problem of the traditional KNN by adding solid heuristics in choosing the neighbors of the tested item. EKNN depends on measuring the degree of both closeness and strength of each neighbor of the tested item, then elects only the qualified neighbors for classification. Accordingly, EKNN can accurately detect infected patients with the minimum time penalty based on those significant features selected by HFSM technique. Extensive experiments have been done considering the proposed detection strategy as well as recent competitive techniques on the chest CT images. Experimental results have shown that the proposed detection strategy outperforms recent techniques as it introduces the maximum accuracy rate.",2020-10-12,"Shaban, Warda M.; Rabie, Asmaa H.; Saleh, Ahmed I.; Abo-Elsoud, M.A.",Knowl Based Syst,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/095b12efa83246b05eef92bd1cafd8d009fb1ede.json; document_parses/pdf_json/9fb05e30578ed8189fb3d5e8bf3e71034a316c93.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7368426.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834553/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.knosys.2020.106270; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0950705120304573; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705120304573?v=s5,220627948.0

A bivariate analysis was performed using the chi-square test, linear trend chi-square, and Student's t-test, and a multivariate analysis of stepwise binary logistic regression was performed to predict the perception of cycle abnormality. In total, 77.4% of participants displayed normality; however, in self-reporting of menstrual characteristics, 67.4% identified alterations.

METHODS: Scoping review based on literaature searches in national and international health science databases (Pubmed/Medline, Biblioteca virtual en salud (BVS), Scielo, COCHRANE and CUIDEN) and websites, and additionally by a ""snowball"" system. MeSH terms were used: ""COVID-19"", ""Pregnancy"", ""Delivery, Obstetric"" ""Pregnant Women"" and ""Maternal"". As limits in the search Spanish and English languages were selected. No limits were established in relation to the year of publication or type of article. RESULTS: A total of 49 documents and articles were detected, of which 27 were analyzed, 18 were used, and 9 were discarded because they did not contain practical recommendations. The recommendations were grouped into 9 subjects: Prevention of infection in pregnant women, Prevention of infection in health care personnel attending pregnant women, Form of presentation and severity in pregnant women, Maternal-fetal transmission (vertical and perinatal), Maternal-fetal control of the pregnant woman infected with COVID-19, Control of the severely pregnant woman with COVID-19, Treatment of the pregnant woman with COVID-19, Management and route of termination of labor, Neonatal outcomes in women with COVID-19 and Breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: Lack of strong evidence to support many of the recommendations for pregnant women with COVID-19, as they are based on previous experience with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections.

A handful of static structures now provide molecular insights into how SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV interact with its host target, which is the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Molecular recognition, binding and function are dynamic processes. To evaluate this, multiple all atom molecular dynamics simulations of at least 500 ns each were performed to better understand the structural stability and interfacial interactions between the receptor binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bound to ACE2. Several contacts were observed to form, break and reform in the interface during the simulations. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 utilizes unique strategies to achieve stable binding to ACE2. Several differences were observed between the residues of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV that consistently interacted with ACE2. Notably, a stable salt bridge between Lys417 of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and Asp30 of ACE2 as well as three stable hydrogen bonds between Tyr449, Gln493, and Gln498 of SARS-CoV-2 and Asp38, Glu35, and Lys353 of ACE2 were observed, which were absent in the SARS-CoV-ACE2 interface. Some previously reported residues, which were suggested to enhance the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2, were not observed to form stable interactions in these simulations. Stable binding to the host receptor is crucial for virus entry. Therefore, special consideration should be given to these stable interactions while designing potential drugs and treatment modalities to target or disrupt this interface.",2020-06-14,"Ali, Amanat; Vijayan, Ranjit",bioRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c60da74c3436a2c444f9a29f409017d61cc09b4c.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.10.143990,219946985.0

DESIGN Prospective multicentre cohort study. SUBJECTS In total, 304 patients with first-ever stroke (male sex 59%, mean age 68.7 years) participated from Norway (n = 170) and Denmark (n = 134). METHODS The Quality of Life after Brain Injury-Overall Scale (QOLIBRI-OS) was administered twice to measure change in satisfaction with function and wellbeing. RESULTS QOLIBRI-OS scores showed a small statistically significant difference in favour of Norway at 12 months post-stroke (p = 0.02; Cohen's d = 0.26). Using a calculated minimal clinically important difference score of 12, 20% reported worse, 54% unchanged and 26% better QOLIBRI-OS scores between 3 and 12 months.

The functional unit of M(pro) is a homodimer and each subunit contains a His41/Cys145 catalytic dyad. Large amounts of biochemical and structural information are available on M(pro); nevertheless, the mechanism by which monomeric M(pro) is converted into a dimer during maturation still remains poorly understood. Previous studies have suggested that a C‐terminal residue, Arg298, interacts with Ser123 of the other monomer in the dimer, and mutation of Arg298 results in a monomeric structure with a collapsed substrate‐binding pocket. Interestingly, the R298A mutant of M(pro) shows a reversible substrate‐induced dimerization that is essential for catalysis. Here, the conformational change that occurs during substrate‐induced dimerization is delineated by X‐ray crystallography. A dimer with a mutual orientation of the monomers that differs from that of the wild‐type protease is present in the asymmetric unit. The presence of a complete substrate‐binding pocket and oxyanion hole in both protomers suggests that they are both catalytically active, while the two domain IIIs show minor reorganization.

The aims of this study were to assess the impact of repeated blood samplings on patients’ anaemic state using standard-volume tubes, in comparison with the hypothetical use of low-volume tubes and to evaluate the transfusion policy adopted. Study design and methods Transfusion data of mechanically ventilated non-bleeding patients with COVID-19 disease hospitalized in ICU for a minimum of 20 days were recorded. The total volume of blood drawn for samplings with standard-volume tubes and the corresponding red blood cell mass (RBCM) removed during hospitalization for each patient were calculated and compared with the hypothetical use of low-volume tubes. Results Twenty-four patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Ten patients were anaemic at ICU admission (41.7%). Overall, 6,658 sampling tubes were employed, for a total of 16,786 mL of blood. The median RBCM subtracted by blood samplings per patient accounted for about one third of the total patients’ RBCM decrease until discharge. The use of low-volume tubes would have led to a median saving of about one third of the drawn RBCM. Eleven patients were transfused (45.8%) at a mean Hb value of 7.7 (± 0.5) g/dL. Conclusion The amount of blood drawn for sampling has a significant role in the development of anaemia and the use of low-volume tubes could minimize the problem.

222560,b0vs2bgk,,WHO,Reducing overdose after release from incarceration (ROAR): study protocol for an intervention to reduce risk of fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose among women after release from prison,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Drug overdose is the leading cause of death after release from prison, and this risk is significantly higher among women compared to men. Within the first 2 weeks after release, the risk of death from drug overdose is 12.7 times higher than the general population, with risk of death further elevated among females. Although female inmates have higher rates of opioid use disorder and post-release overdose fatality, justice-involved women are under-represented in studies of medications for opioid use disorder. The Reducing Overdose After Release from Incarceration (ROAR) pilot intervention and evaluation (recruitment June 2019 through December 2020) aims to reduce opioid overdose among women released to the community following incarceration in state prison. The evaluation further assesses induction, acceptance and effectiveness of extended release naltrexone in a female post-prison population. METHODS/DESIGN: In the week prior to their release, female adults in custody with moderate to severe opioid use disorder start treatment with extended release naltrexone, an injectable opioid antagonist that blocks the effects of opioids for up to 1 month. All ROAR participants receive training to use naloxone rescue kits and are provided nasal naloxone at release. Ongoing support from a certified recovery mentor to facilitate sustained engagement with treatment for substance use disorders begins in the month prior to release from prison and continues for 6 months in community. We evaluate the association between ROAR participation and the primary outcome of opioid overdose. Using administrative data provided by the Oregon Department of Corrections and the Oregon Health Authority, we compare the odds of overdose among ROAR participants versus a comparison group of females released from prison during the study period. Evaluation activities in community includes survey and qualitative interviews for 6 months post release, as well as a review of clinic records to assess retention on medication among the pilot cohort (N = 100). DISCUSSION: ROAR is a collaboration between Oregon's public health, criminal justice, and medical communities. The ROAR intervention and evaluation provide critical information on improving interventions to prevent opioid overdose and improve retention on treatment in community in an overlooked, high-risk population: incarcerated women re-entering the community.

A rapid, sensitive and easy-to-use test for viral infections is essential to prevent and control such viral pandemics. Furthermore, a compact, portable device is potentially very useful in remote or developing regions without easy access to sophisticated laboratory facilities. In this report we discuss the application of a Young interferometer sensor device for ultrasensitive and real-time detection of viruses. The essential innovation in this technique is the combination of an integrated optical interferometric sensor with antibody-antigen recognition approaches to yield very sensitive, rapid virus detection.

Design: Prospective, cross-sectional survey of (n = 2157) male and female subjects, 13–88 years of age, living in Bangladesh. Methods: Ethical approval and trial registration were obtained before the commencement of the study. Subjects who volunteered to participate and signed the informed consent were enrolled in the study and completed the structured questionnaire on KAP and Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S). Results: Twenty-eight percent (28.69%) of subjects reported one or more COVID-19 symptoms, and 21.4% of subjects reported one or more co-morbidities. Knowledge scores were slightly higher in males (8.75± 1.58) than females (8.66± 1.70). Knowledge was significantly correlated with age (p < .005), an education level (p < .001), attitude (p < .001), and urban location (p < .001). Knowledge scores showed an inverse correlation with fear scores (p < .001). Eighty-three percent (83.7%) of subjects with COVID-19 symptoms reported wearing a mask in public, and 75.4% of subjects reported staying away from crowded places.

As of Feb 17th, 2020, statistical data show that the outbreak constitutes an epidemic threat in China, where the exponential increase in patients has reached 75114 confirmed cases, with 2239 deaths. Different from SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) infection, the initial presentations or the chief complain of some patients with the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) were gastrointestinal symptoms. So we call upon all the first-line medical staff to be cautious and pay more attention to those untypical patients especially from the epidemic area. Besides, as the viral nucleic acids could be found in the fecal samples and anal swabs of some patients with COVID-19 infection, the possibility of fecal-oral transmission need to be took into account. Based on the previously and recently studies, we speculate that COVID-19 may have some relationship with the gut microbiota through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, thus targeting gut microbiota might be a new therapeutic option for the treatment of virus-related pneumonia.

In the COVID-19 pandemic, palliative care has received unprecedented levels of societal attention. Unfortunately, this has not been enough to prevent patients dying alone, relatives not being able to say goodbye and palliative care being used instead of intensive care due to resource limitations. Yet global guidance was available. In 2018, the WHO released a guide on 'Integrating palliative care and symptom relief into the response to humanitarian emergencies and crises'-the first guidance on the topic by an international body. AIMS: This paper argues that while a landmark document, the WHO guide took a narrowly clinical bioethics perspective and missed crucial moral dilemmas. We argue for adding a population-level bioethics lens, which draws forth complex moral dilemmas arising from the fact that groups having differential innate and acquired resources in the context of social and historical determinants of health. We discuss dilemmas concerning: limitations of material and human resources; patient prioritisation; euthanasia; and legacy inequalities, discrimination and power imbalances. IMPLICATIONS: In parts of the world where opportunity for preparation still exists, and as countries emerge from COVID-19, planners must consider care for the dying. Immediate steps to support better resolutions to ethical dilemmas of the provision of palliative care in humanitarian and emergency contexts will require honest debate; concerted research effort; and international, national and local ethical guidance.",2020,"Wynne, Keona Jeane; Petrova, Mila; Coghlan, Rachel",J Med Ethics,,#607888,,,,,219951497.0

These models allow high precision ASR for domains and words represented in the training material but have difficulties recognising words that are rarely or not at all represented during training, i.e. trending words and new named entities. In this paper, we use a text-to-speech (TTS) engine to provide synthetic audio for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. We aim to boost the recognition accuracy of a recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) on OOV words by using those extra audio-text pairs, while maintaining the performance on the non-OOV words. Different regularisation techniques are explored and the best performance is achieved by fine-tuning the RNN-T on both original training data and extra synthetic data with elastic weight consolidation (EWC) applied on encoder.

Given the recent outbreaks of contagious infectious diseases worldwide, including Ebola virus and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, there is urgent need for further research to determine optimal PPE use in high-risk settings. This review intends to provide a general understanding of PPE and to provide guidelines for appropriate use based on current evidence. RECENT FINDINGS Although previous studies have focused on the efficacy of PPE in preventing transmission of pathogens, recent studies have examined the dangers to HCWs during removal of PPE when risk of contamination is highest. Access to adequate PPE supplies is crucial to preventing transmission of pathogens, especially in resource-limited settings. Adherence to appropriate PPE use is a challenge due to inadequate education on its usage, technical difficulties, and tolerability of PPE in the workplace. Future projects aim at ameliorating this situation, including redesigning PPE which is crucial to improving the safety of HCWs.

To support the process, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among the Hungarian population to estimate the prevalence of infectious cases and prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. A representative sample (n = 17,787) for the Hungarian population of 14 years or older living in private households (n = 8,283,810) was selected. The study was performed within 16 days after 50 days of restrictions, when the number of confirmed cases was stable low. Naso- and oropharyngeal smears and blood samples were collected for PCR and antibody testing. The testing was accompanied by a questionnaire about symptoms, comorbidities, and contacts. Design-based prevalence estimates were calculated. In total, 10,474 individuals (67.7% taken into account a sample frame error of 2315) of the selected sample participated in the survey. Of the tested individuals, 3 had positive PCR and 69 had positive serological test. Population estimate of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seropositivity were 2421 and 56,439, respectively, thus active infection rate (2.9/10,000) and the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure (68/10,000) was low. Self-reported loss of smell or taste and body aches were significantly more frequent among those with SARS-CoV-2. In this representative, cross-sectional survey of the Hungarian population with a high participation rate, the overall active infection rate was low in sync with the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure.

In mid-March, by which time countries around the world were experiencing rapidly increasing numbers of cases and deaths, the World Health Organization categorized the outbreak as a pandemic. This new coronavirus was designated SARS-COV-2 in recognition of its similarity to the coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2002-2003. The race is on to develop treatments that can mitigate the severe consequences of infection and vaccines that can prevent infection and/or diminish the severity of disease in those who do get infected. Many challenges face these development efforts. Some are similar to those faced in the past; others are new.

In light of the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), we aimed to review existing health security capacities against public health risks and events. METHODS: We used 18 indicators from the IHR State Party Annual Reporting (SPAR) tool and associated data from national SPAR reports to develop five indices: (1) prevent, (2) detect, (3) respond, (4) enabling function, and (5) operational readiness. We used SPAR 2018 data for all of the indicators and categorised countries into five levels across the indices, in which level 1 indicated the lowest level of national capacity and level 5 the highest. We also analysed data at the regional level (using the six geographical WHO regions). FINDINGS: Of 182 countries, 52 (28%) had prevent capacities at levels 1 or 2, and 60 (33%) had response capacities at levels 1 or 2. 81 (45%) countries had prevent capacities and 78 (43%) had response capacities at levels 4 or 5, indicating that these countries were operationally ready. 138 (76%) countries scored more highly in the detect index than in the other indices. 44 (24%) countries did not have an effective enabling function for public health risks and events, including infectious disease outbreaks (7 [4%] at level 1 and 37 [20%] at level 2). 102 (56%) countries had level 4 or level 5 enabling function capacities in place. 32 (18%) countries had low readiness (2 [1%] at level 1 and 30 [17%] at level 2), and 104 (57%) countries were operationally ready to prevent, detect, and control an outbreak of a novel infectious disease (66 [36%] at level 4 and 38 [21%] at level 5). INTERPRETATION: Countries vary widely in terms of their capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to outbreaks. Half of all countries analysed have strong operational readiness capacities in place, which suggests that an effective response to potential health emergencies could be enabled, including to COVID-19. Findings from local risk assessments are needed to fully understand national readiness capacities in relation to COVID-19. Capacity building and collaboration between countries are needed to strengthen global readiness for outbreak control.

RS showed inhibitory effects on viral proliferation of enveloped viruses in vitro. Evaluation of the anti-IFV activity of RS in vitro showed that it inhibited both virus adsorption and entry steps. The oral administration of RS in IFV-infected immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice suppressed viral proliferation in both mouse types. The oral administration of RS also had stimulatory effects on neutralizing antibody production. Fluorescent analysis showed that RS colocalized with M cells in Peyer's patches, suggesting that RS bound to the M cells and may be incorporated into the Peyer's patches, which are essential to intestinal immunity.

The path for virus invasion into humans and other hosts is mediated by host-pathogen interactions, specifically virus-receptor binding. An in-depth understanding of the virus-receptor binding mechanism is a prerequisite for the discovery of vaccines, antibodies, and small-molecule inhibitors that can interrupt this interaction and prevent or cure infection. In this review, we discuss the viral entry mechanism, the known structural aspects of virus-receptor interactions (SARS-CoV-2 S/humanACE2, SARS-CoV S/humanACE2, and MERS-CoV S/humanDPP4), the key protein domains and amino acid residues involved in binding, and the small-molecule inhibitors and other drugs that have (as of June 2020) exhibited therapeutic potential.

T-cell immunity to COVID-19 is mediated through differentiated CD4+ T-cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells, although their differentiation is often atypical and ambiguous in COVID-19 and single cell dynamics of key genes need to be characterized. Notably, T-cells are dysregulated in severe COVID-19 patients, although their molecular features are still yet to be fully revealed. Importantly, it is not clear which T-cell activities are beneficial and protective and which ones can contribute to the development of severe COVID-19. In this article, we examine the latest evidence and discuss the key features of T-cell responses in COVID-19, showing how T-cells are dysregulated in severe COVID-19 patients. Particularly, we highlight the impairment of FOXP3 induction in CD4+ T-cells and how the impaired FOXP3 expression can lead to the differentiation of abnormally activated (hyperactivated) T-cells and the dysregulated T-cell responses in severe patients.

Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) is a constitutive tissue protector with antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. A1AT inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection and two of the most important proteases in the pathophysiology of Covid-19: the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and the disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17). It also inhibits the activity of inflammatory molecules, such as IL-8, TNF-&#945;, and neutrophil elastase (NE). TMPRSS2 is essential for SARS-CoV-2-S protein priming and viral infection. ADAM17 mediates ACE2, IL-6R, and TNF-&#945; shedding. ACE2 is the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor and a key component for the balance of the renin-angiotensin system, inflammation, vascular permeability, and pulmonary homeostasis. In addition, clinical findings indicate that A1AT levels might be important in defining Covid-19 outcomes, potentially partially explaining associations with air pollution and with diabetes.

135287,r48334lr,,WHO,Protocol for Partner2Lose: A randomized controlled trial to evaluate partner involvement on long-term weight loss,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Behavioral interventions produce clinically significant weight reduction, with many participants regaining weight subsequently. Most interventions focus on an individual, but dietary and physical activity behaviors occur with, or are influenced by, domestic partners. According to interdependence theory, couples who approach behavior change as a problem to be tackled together versus independently are more likely to utilize communal coping processes to promote behavior change. We utilized interdependence theory to develop a partner-assisted intervention to increase long-term weight loss. METHODS: Community-dwelling individuals (index participants) cohabitating with a partner with 1) overweight and at least one obesity-related comorbidity or 2) obesity are randomized to participate in a standard weight management program alone or with their partner. The weight management program involves biweekly, in-person, group sessions focusing on weight loss for six months, followed by three group sessions and nine telephone calls focusing on weight loss maintenance for twelve months. In the partner-assisted arm, partners participate in half of the group sessions and telephone calls. Couples receive training in principles of cognitive behavioral therapy for couples, including sharing thoughts and feelings and joint problem solving, to increase communal coping. The primary outcome is participant weight loss at 24 months, with caloric intake and moderate-intensity physical activity as secondary outcomes.

Regional anesthesia, whether peripheral nerve or neuraxial, is a safe alternative for managing patients with COVID-19, by choosing modalities that mitigate pulmonary function involvement. Adopting regional anesthesia mitigates adverse effects in the post-operative period and provides safety to patients and teams, as long as there is compliance with individual protection and interpersonal transmission care measures. Respecting contra-indications and judicial use of safety techniques and norms are essential.

Many older adults worldwide are continuing to work past traditional retirement age, raising the question whether older adults experience depression, anxiety, or burnout at the same or greater levels as younger workers, and whether there are differences by age in these levels over time. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Longitudinal survey of 1161 currently employed US clergy followed every 6-12 months for up to 66 months. MEASUREMENTS: Depression was measured with the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). Anxiety was measured using the anxiety component of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Burnout symptoms were assessed using the three components of the Maslach Burnout Inventory: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and sense of personal accomplishment (PA). RESULTS: Older participants had lower scores of depression, anxiety, EE, and DP and higher levels of PA over time compared to younger adults. Levels of EE decreased for older working adults, while not significantly changing over time for those younger. DP symptoms decreased over time among those 55 years or older but increased among those 25-54 years. CONCLUSIONS: Older working adults may have higher levels of resilience and be able to balance personal life with their occupation as well as may engage in certain behaviors that increase social support and, for clergy, spiritual well-being that may decrease stress in a way that allows these older adults to appear to tolerate working longer without poorer mental health outcomes.",2020,"Hybels, Celia F; Blazer, Dan G; Eagle, David E; Proeschold-Bell, Rae Jean",Int Psychogeriatr,,#32985393,,,,,222162586.0

To date, there are no antiviral drugs or specific therapies to treat MERS-CoV. To rapidly identify potential inhibitors of MERS-CoV replication, we expressed the papain-like protease (PLpro) and the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) from MERS-CoV and developed luciferase-based biosensors to monitor protease activity in cells. We show that the expressed MERS-CoV PLpro recognizes and processes the canonical CoV-PLpro cleavage site RLKGG in the biosensor. However, existing CoV PLpro inhibitors were unable to block MERS-CoV PLpro activity, likely due to the divergence of the amino acid sequence in the drug binding site. To investigate MERS-CoV 3CLpro activity, we expressed the protease in context with flanking nonstructural protein 4 (nsp4) and the amino-terminal portion of nsp6 and detected processing of the luciferase-based biosensors containing the canonical 3CLpro cleavage site VRLQS. Importantly, we found that a small-molecule inhibitor that blocks replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV and murine CoV also inhibits the activity of MERS-CoV 3CLpro. Overall, the protease expression and biosensor assays developed here allow for rapid evaluation of viral protease activity and the identification of protease inhibitors.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Moovosity™ programme, a novel digital application to increase FMS proficiency in 3- to 6-year-old children. Methods: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted involving 34 parent-child dyads randomly assigned to either the 8-week intervention (n = 17) or wait-list control (n = 17) condition. FMS proficiency, PA, and parental support for PA was assessed at baseline and 8-weeks. Intervention participants were given free access to the app over a period of 8 weeks. Wait-listed controls were given access after the 8-week period. Group differences for pre to post changes in outcomes were tested for significance using general linear mixed models. Results: There was a significant group by time interaction for object control skills (F1,32 = 10.81, P = 0.003). Intervention children exhibited significant improvements in object control skills, while children in the wait-list control group exhibited a modest decline.

Sequence analysis of independent clones demonstrated an overall mutation frequency approaching 1.2 x 10(-3) to 6.7 x 10(-3). The rate of fixation of mutations was about 1.2 x 10(-5) to 7.6 x 10(-5) per nucleotide (nt) per day. In contrast to finding in bovine coronavirus, the MHV leader RNA sequences were extremely stable and did not evolve significantly during persistent infection. Rather, a 5' untranslated region (UTR) A-to-G mutation at nt 77 in the genomic RNA emerged by day 56 and accumulated until 50 to 80% of the genome-length molecules retained the mutation by 119 days postinfection. Although other 5'-end mutations were noted, only the nt 77 mutation was significantly associated with viral persistence in vitro. Mutations were also found in the 5' end of the p28 coding region, but no specific alterations accumulated in genome-length molecules through 119 days postinfection. The 5' UTR nt 77 mutation resulted in an 18-amino-acid open reading frame (ORF) upstream of the ORF 1a AUG start site. By in vitro translation assays, the small ORF was not translated into detectable product but the mutation significantly enhanced translation of the downstream p28 ORF about 2.5-fold. Variant viruses, containing either the nt 77 A-to-G mutation (V16-ATG+) or wild-type sequences at this locus (V1-ATG-), were isolated at 119 days postinfection. The variant viruses replicated more efficiently than wild-type virus and were extremely cytolytic in DBT cells, suggesting that the A-to-G mutation did not encode a nonlytic or attenuated phenotype. Consistent with the in vitro translation results, a significant increase (approximately 3.5-fold) in p28 expression was also observed with the mutant virus (V16-ATG+) in DBT cells compared with that in wild-type controls.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the difference in complete blood count parameters and differential counts in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who survived compared to those who died. DESIGN: We performed a single-center retrospective study including 242 patients with confirmed COVID-19. We described the characteristics of the complete blood count parameters in these patients. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare hematologic parameters of patients who died and those who survived; multivariate logistic regression was used to look for associations with mortality. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 who died had significantly lower median absolute monocyte count (AMC) (0.4 vs 0.5, P = .039) and median platelet count (169 vs 213, P = .009) compared to those who survived. Patients who died had a significantly higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (6.4 vs 4.5, P = .001). The NLR was positively associated with death (OR = 1.038; 95% CI, 1.003-1.074, P = .031), while AMC was inversely associated with death (OR = 0.200; 95% CI, 0.052-0.761, P = .018).

Overall use, but especially non-indicated use, and misuse of antibiotics are drivers of antibiotic resistance (ABR). High non-indicated use of antibiotics for uncomplicated vaginal deliveries is widespread in many parts of the world. Similarly, irrational use of antibiotics is reported for children. There is scarcity of evidence regarding antibiotic use and ABR in Lao PDR (Laos). The overarching aim of this project is to fill those knowledge gaps and to evaluate a quality improvement intervention. The primary objective is to estimate the proportion of uncomplicated vaginal deliveries where antibiotics are used and to compare its trend before and after the intervention. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This 3-year, prospective, quasiexperimental study without comparison group includes a formative and interventional phase. Data on antibiotic use during delivery will be collected from medical records. Knowledge, attitudes and reported practices on antibiotic use in pregnancy, during delivery and for children, will be collected from women through questionnaires. Healthcare providers’ knowledge, attitudes and practices of antibiotics administration for pregnant women, during delivery and for children, will be collected via adapted questionnaires. Perceptions regarding antibiotics will be explored through focus group discussions with women and individual interviews with key stakeholders. Faecal samples for culturing of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. and antibiotic susceptibility testing will be taken before, during and 6 months after delivery to determine colonisation of resistant strains. The planned intervention will comprise training workshops, educational materials and social media campaign and will be evaluated using interrupted time series analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The project received ethical approval from the National Ethics Committee for Health Research, Ministry of Health, Laos. The results will be disseminated via scientific publications, conference presentations and communication with stakeholders.

Upon laser ablation of arterioles, rapid vasospasm was induced, concomitant with a transient increase in calcium concentration in arteriolar smooth muscles. Unlike the increase in calcium concentration, vasoconstriction and ROCK activation continued for several minutes. Both the ROCK inhibitor, fasudil, and the ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor blocker, hexamethonium, inhibited laser-induced ROCK activation and reduced the duration of vasospasm at the segments distant from the irradiated point.

METHODS: An anonymous online survey was launched on March 24, 2020 in Brazil to assess how families with children aged up to 12 years are adjusting their daily routines to this situation. In the survey, each family reported the daily time each child spent in sedentary activity (sum of intellectual activities, play time on screen, playing without PA) and PA (sum of playing with PA and PA). RESULTS: The main findings based on data from 816 children indicate that most parents consider there was a reduction in the time that children spend practicing PA; increase in screen play time and family activities, differences between sex were found regarding screen play time (boys>girls) and in playing without PA (girls>boys), and there was an age effect for all categories analyzed, with a tendency to increase the total time of sedentary lifestyle and complementary reducing the time of PA over age.

Herein, we summarize the available literature and fill-in the gaps in this regard. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We have performed a literature search for articles in PubMed, EMBASE and Google Scholar databases till May 12, 2020, with following keywords: “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “HLH”, “HScore”, “coagulopathy”, “D-dimer”, “cytokine storm”, “children” and “pediatrics” with interposition of Boolean operator “AND”. RESULTS: Children presenting with moderate-severe COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease shock-like syndrome exhibit peripheral blood picture analogous to HLH. HScore, a validated tool to diagnose HLH, has been suggested to screen severe COVID-19 patients for cytokine storm. However, HScore faces certain limitations in this scenario. It may be more pragmatic to use ‘high D-dimer’ (> 3 µg/mL) instead of ‘low fibrinogen’ to facilitate early detection of cytokine storm. COVID-19 associated coagulopathy resembles hypercoagulable form of DIC with bleeding being rarely reported. Although the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) interim guidance recommends low molecular weight heparin in all hospitalized patients, data is lacking in population below 14 years of age. However, in the presence of life-threatening thromboembolic event or symptomatic acro-ischemia, unfractionated heparin (UFH) should be used with caution. CONCLUSIONS: HScore can be used as a complement to clinical decision for initiating immunosuppression. Children with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, especially those with documented thrombocytopenia or chilblains, should be regularly monitored for coagulopathy.",2020-09-18,"Bhattacharjee, Sukrita; Banerjee, Mainak; Pal, Rimesh",Indian Pediatr,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e314cef0d8df151020edec535ef9a420a871b31f.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7498551/,

As always, natural disasters or infectious disease outbreaks have the potential to cause emergency department (ED) volume changes. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the influence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on ED visits and the impact on the handling of patients requiring urgent revascularization. METHODS: We reviewed the charts of all patients presenting to the ED of Hospital Sainte Anne (Toulon, France) from March 23 to April 5, 2020 and compared them with those of the same period in 2019. Then we analyzed complementary data on acute coronary syndrome (ST-elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI] and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI]) and neurovascular emergencies (strokes and transient ischemic attacks). RESULTS: The total number of visits decreased by 47%. The number of people assessed as triage level 2 was 8% lower in 2020. There were five fewer cases of NSTEMI in 2020, but the same number of STEMI. The number of neurovascular emergencies increased (27 cases in 2019 compared with 30 in 2020). We observed a reduction in the delay between arrival at the ED and the beginning of coronary angiography for STEMI cases (27 min in 2019 and 22 min in 2020). In 2020, 7 more stroke patients were admitted. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic probably dissuaded ""non-critical"" patients from coming to the hospital, whereas the same number of patients with a critical illness attended the ED as attended prior to the pandemic. There does not seem to have been any effect of the pandemic on patients requiring reperfusion therapy (STEMI and stroke).",2020,"Montagnon, Romain; Rouffilange, Louis; Agard, Geoffray; Benner, Patrick; Cazes, Nicolas; Renard, Aurélien",J. emerg. med,,#894015,,,,,226199771.0

However, recent developments in holomorphic HF theory show that this disappearing behaviour is only a manifestation of the way conventional HF equations prevent solutions from being analytically continued, but it is unclear what factors govern the existence and the locations of these disappearances. In this work, we explore some of these factors from the perspective of spatial symmetry by introducing a classification for symmetry constraints on electronic-structure calculations. This forms a framework for us to systematically investigate several analytical holomorphic HF solutions of a model $\textrm{[H}_4\textrm{]}^{2+}$ system in STO-3G and demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, spatial symmetry imposes strict requirements on the reality of certain solutions. The implications for self-consistent-field HF search algorithms are then discussed.

We propose herein to evaluate the impact of implementing conservative management as an alternative approach to surgical appendectomy in the treatment of proven acute appendicitis during COVID19 pandemic. Methods Our study is a prospective multicenter study that includes a cohort of 160 patients admitted to the surgical departments in both Tawam Hospital and Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City, Abu Dhabi, UAE, for the period from February 2020 till July 2020. Results Our results showed that 56 of our patients (35%) were treated conservatively, while the other 104 (65%) underwent operative management. There was a significant decrease in length of hospital stay (LOS) (2.32 days) among the first group compared to the second (2.8 days). Also, short term follow-up showed that 90% of those patients did not require further operative intervention or developed any serious complications. Out of the 110 patients that were swapped for COVID19, nine (8.18%) were confirmed to be positive. Our protocol was to avoid surgical management for COVID19 positive patients unless indicated. This resulted in (8/9) of COVID19 positive patients to be treated conservatively. Follow up was achieved by using telemedicine-based follow-up with the aim of empowering social distancing and reducing risk of viral exposure to patients as well as the health care providers. In conclusion, our results showed that the implementation of conservative management in treating patients with acute appendicitis who were COVID19 positive is a safe and feasible approach that maybe essential in reducing viral transmission risks as well as avoiding operative risks on COVID19 positive patients.",2020-09-30,"Hashmi, Fatima Y.

However, the exact molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remain largely unknown. Methods Genome wide screening was used to establish intra-viral and viral-host interactomes. Quantitative proteomics was used to investigate peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proteome signature in COVID-19. Findings We elucidated 286 host proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and more than 350 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in COVID-19 derived PBMCs. This signature in severe COVID-19 PBMCs reveals significant upregulation of cellular proteins related to neutrophil activation and blood coagulation, as well as downregulation of proteins mediating T cell receptor signaling. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein 10 interacts with NF-kappa-B-repressing factor (NKRF) to facilitate interleukin-8 (IL-8) induction, which potentially contributes to IL-8-mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and the overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients.

RESULTS: Among key interventions analyzed, mandatory vaccination policies or multifaceted campaigns including a vaccinate-or-wear-a-mask policy as well as mandatory declination reached vaccination coverage in healthcare workers of over 90%. Although campaigns solely based on education and promotion or on-site-vaccination did not regularly exceed an absolute vaccination coverage of 40%, a substantial relative increase in vaccination coverage was reached by implementation of these strategies. CONCLUSION: Mandatory vaccination policies are effective measures to achieve high overall vaccination coverage.

METHODS: This study included 104 participants, &#8805;18 years old who were previous patients of family health clinics for a variety of reasons in the months preceding the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence was administered to these patients as part of their initial intakes. The participants were asked to complete a questionnaire related to socio-demographic information and the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence after obtaining agreement to participate during the pandemic period. In addition, written informed consent was obtained. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 20, was used to analyse the acquired data. RESULTS: The participants were 48.1% and 51.9% women and men, respectively. The pre-pandemic and Covid-19 pandemic mean smoking addiction scores were 5.03 and 5.6, respectively. The smoking addiction levels before and during the Covid-19 pandemic significantly differed (P < .001). Of the individuals with low smoking addiction levels before the pandemic, 17.6% and 29.4% became moderately and highly addicted, respectively. Of the individuals with moderate smoking addiction level, 6.3% and 43.9% became lowly and highly addicted, respectively. CONCLUSION: The smoking addiction level may change based on various factors including behavioural changes. While increases in smoking addiction during the pandemic can be observed caused by behavioural changes and anxieties that may arise because of the pandemic, a decrease in addiction levels and even smoking cessation can also be observed during these times because of the more progressive course of Covid-19 in smokers.

These conversations have also included various conspiracies shared by social media users. Amongst them, a popular theory has linked 5G to the spread of COVID-19, leading to misinformation and the burning of 5G towers in the United Kingdom. The understanding of the drivers of fake news and quick policies oriented to isolate and rebate misinformation are keys to combating it. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an understanding of the drivers of the 5G COVID-19 conspiracy theory and strategies to deal with such misinformation. METHODS: This paper performs a social network analysis and content analysis of Twitter data from a 7-day period (Friday, March 27, 2020, to Saturday, April 4, 2020) in which the #5GCoronavirus hashtag was trending on Twitter in the United Kingdom. Influential users were analyzed through social network graph clusters. The size of the nodes were ranked by their betweenness centrality score, and the graph’s vertices were grouped by cluster using the Clauset-Newman-Moore algorithm. The topics and web sources used were also examined. RESULTS: Social network analysis identified that the two largest network structures consisted of an isolates group and a broadcast group. The analysis also revealed that there was a lack of an authority figure who was actively combating such misinformation. Content analysis revealed that, of 233 sample tweets, 34.8% (n=81) contained views that 5G and COVID-19 were linked, 32.2% (n=75) denounced the conspiracy theory, and 33.0% (n=77) were general tweets not expressing any personal views or opinions. Thus, 65.2% (n=152) of tweets derived from nonconspiracy theory supporters, which suggests that, although the topic attracted high volume, only a handful of users genuinely believed the conspiracy. This paper also shows that fake news websites were the most popular web source shared by users; although, YouTube videos were also shared. The study also identified an account whose sole aim was to spread the conspiracy theory on Twitter. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of quick and targeted interventions oriented to delegitimize the sources of fake information is key to reducing their impact. Those users voicing their views against the conspiracy theory, link baiting, or sharing humorous tweets inadvertently raised the profile of the topic, suggesting that policymakers should insist in the efforts of isolating opinions that are based on fake news. Many social media platforms provide users with the ability to report inappropriate content, which should be used.

All GPI-anchored proteins detected (3–9 per cell type, at least 13 different proteins) are found to be apically polarized; no GPI-anchored protein is observed preferentially localized to the basal surface. One of the GPI-anchored proteins is identified as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Survey of MDCK II-RCA(r), a mutant cell line with a pleiotropic defect in galactosylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids (that presumably affects GPI anchors) also reveals an apical polarization of all GPI-anchored proteins. In contrast, analysis of MDCK II-ConA′ (a mutant cell line with an unknown defect in glycosylation) revealed five GPI-anchored proteins, two of which appeared relatively unpolarized.

The causative pathogen is a novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2 with genomic similarities with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The disease is transmitted among humans either through direct contact or via droplets from sneeze or cough. Most infected persons remain asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, but some patients may develop severe clinical features, including pneumonia, respiratory failure, sepsis and even death. People of advanced age and/or with underlying diseases (including diabetes mellitus) are at greater risk. The innate and adaptive immune system are responsible for protecting the body against viral infection. Nevertheless, it is assumed that SARS-CoV-2 interferes with the immune system through immunomodulating mechanisms which intensify its pathogenesis. A delayed or reduced response of the innate immune system is critical for the development of pathogenesis of the virus. People with diabetes are more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19.

The detection of specific CXR findings has been the main focus of several artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However, the wide range of possible CXR abnormalities makes it impractical to build specific systems to detect every possible condition. In this work, we developed and evaluated an AI system to classify CXRs as normal or abnormal. For development, we used a de-identified dataset of 248,445 patients from a multi-city hospital network in India. To assess generalizability, we evaluated our system using 6 international datasets from India, China, and the United States. Of these datasets, 4 focused on diseases that the AI was not trained to detect: 2 datasets with tuberculosis and 2 datasets with coronavirus disease 2019.

Serological antibody test is one important diagnostic method increasingly used in the clinic, although its clinical application is still under investigation. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the diagnostic performances of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 specific antibody tests in COVID-19 patients. Test results analyzed included (1) IgM-positive but IgG-negative (IgM+IgG-), (2) IgG-positive but IgM-negative (IgG+IgM-), (3) both IgM and IgG-positive (IgM+IgG+), (4) IgM-positive without IgG information (IgM+IgG+/-), (5) IgG-positive without IgM information (IgG+IgM+/-), (6) either IgM or IgG-positive (IgM+ or IgG+), and (7) IgA-positive (IgA+). RESULTS: Sixty-eight studies were included. The pooled sensitivities of IgM+IgG-, IgG+IgM-, IgM+IgG+, IgM+IgG+/-, IgG+IgM+/-, and IgM+ or IgG+ were 6%, 7%, 53%, 68%, 73%, and 79% respectively. The pooled specificity ranged from 98% to 100%. The IgA+ had a pooled sensitivity of 78%, but a relatively low specificity of 88%. Tests conducted two weeks after symptom onset provided improved diagnostic accuracy. Chemiluminescence immunoassay and detection of S protein as the antigen could offer a more accurate diagnostic result. DISCUSSION: Our findings support the supplemental role of serological antibody tests in COVID-19 diagnosis. However, their capacity to diagnose COVID-19 early in the disease course could be limited.",2021,"Chen, Mengyu; Qin, Rundong; Mei, Jiang; Yang, Zhaowei; Wen, Weiping; Li, Jing",Int. j. infect. dis,,#1032496,,,,,231623375.0

However, a number of US states are currently experiencing an alarming post-lockdown resurgence of the pandemic, triggering the fear for a possible severe second wave of the pandemic in some US jurisdictions. We designed a mathematical model for addressing the key question of whether or not the universal use of face masks can halt or curtail such resurgence (and possibly avert a second wave, without having to undergo another cycle of major community lockdown) in the states of Arizona, Florida, New York and the entire US. The model was parametrized and fitted using cumulative mortality data from the four jurisdictions. Our study highlights the importance of early implementation of the community lockdown measures. In particular, a sizable reduction in the burden of the pandemic would have been recorded in each of the four jurisdictions if the community lockdown measures were implemented a week or two earlier. These reductions are greatly augmented if the early implementation of the lockdown measures is complemented with a public face masks use strategy. It is shown that the pandemic would have been almost completely suppressed from significantly taking off if the lockdown measures were implemented two weeks earlier, and if a sizable percentage of the residents of the four jurisdictions wore face masks during the respective lockdown periods. If the level of lifting of community lockdown is high (which entails allowing for greater community contacts and re-opening of businesses and social activities, in comparison to what was allowed during the community lockdown period), the states of Arizona and Florida will record a devastating second wave of the pandemic by the end of 2020, while the state of New York and the entire US will record milder second waves. If the level of lifting for the community lockdown was mild (i.e., only allowing very limited community contacts and business activities, in comparison to the lockdown period), only the state of Florida will experience a second wave. The severity of the projected second wave depends on the level of lifting of the community lockdown. For instance, the projected second wave for Arizona and Florida, associated with moderate and high level of lifting of lockdown, will be more severe than their respective first wave. For high level of lifting of lockdown measures, the increased use of face masks after the lockdown period greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic. In particular, for this high lifting scenario, none of the four jurisdictions will experience a second wave if half of their residents wear face masks consistently after their respective lockdown period). A testing strategy that increases the maximum detection rate of asymptomatic infected individuals (followed by contact tracing and self-isolation of the detected cases) greatly reduces the burden of the pandemic in all four jurisdictions, particularly if also combined with universal face mask use strategy. Universal use of face masks in public, with at least moderate level of compliance, could halt the post-lockdown resurgence of COVID-19, in addition to averting the potential for (or severity of) a second wave of the pandemic in each of the four jurisdictions.",2020-07-07,"Ngonghala, C.

There are no sequence or structure requirements to encapsidate single-stranded nucleic acid cargo. In this work, we wanted to determine how the length of the cargo impacts the stability and structure of the assembled CLPs. We hypothesized that cargo neutralizes the basic region of the alphavirus capsid protein and if the cargo is long enough, it will also act to scaffold the CP monomers together. Experimentally we found that CLPs encapsidating short 27mer oligonucleotides were less stable than CLPs encapsidating 48mer or 90mer oligonucleotides under different chemical and thermal conditions. Furthermore, cryo-EM studies showed there were structural differences between CLPs assembled with 27mer and 48mer cargo. To mimic the role of the cargo in CLP assembly we made a mutant (4D) where we substituted a cluster of four Lys residues in the CP with four Asp residues. We found that these few amino acid substitutions were enough to initiate CLP assembly in the absence of cargo. The cargo-free 4D CLPs show higher resistance to ionic strength and increased temperature compared to wild-type cargo containing CLPs suggesting their CLP assembly mechanism might also be different.",2017-12-06,"Rayaprolu, Vamseedhar; Moore, Alan; Wang, Joseph Che-Yen; Goh, Boon Chong; Perilla, Juan R; Zlotnick, Adam; Mukhopadhyay, Suchetana",J Phys Condens Matter,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7a7db2b9578b0fe1eb9a77e67d0deee30def9f89.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7103146.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7103146/,

Results show that more than two-thirds of the respondents experienced income shocks due to the COVID-19 crisis. Food security and dietary quality worsened, as measured by the food insecurity experience scale and the frequency of consumption of nutritionally-rich foods. The proportion of food insecure respondents increased by 38% and 44% in Kenya and Uganda respectively, and in both countries, the regular consumption of fruits decreased by about 30% during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to a normal period (before the pandemic). Results from probit regressions show that the income-poor households and those dependent on labour income were more vulnerable to income shock, and had poorer food consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to other respondent categories. As such, they were more likely to employ food-based coping strategies compared to those pursuing alternative livelihoods, who generally relied on savings. Farmers were less likely to experience worsened food security compared to other respondent categories who depended to a great extent on market sources for food. In both countries, participation in national social security schemes was less likely to mitigate respondents' income shock during the COVID-19 period. Conversely, membership in savings and loan groups was correlated with less likelihood of suffering income shocks and reduction in food consumption. The results suggest that ongoing and future government responses should focus on structural changes in social security by developing responsive packages to cushion members pushed into poverty by such pandemics while building strong financial institutions to support the recovery of businesses in the medium term, and ensuring the resilience of food supply chains particularly those making available nutrient-dense foods.",2020,"Kansiime, Monica K; Tambo, Justice A; Mugambi, Ms Idah; Bundi, Ms Mary; Kara, Augustine; Owuor, Mr Charles",World Dev,,#779771,,,,,221820244.0

Geriatric facilities have been facing shortages in equipment and supplies, as well as staffing shortages. Finally, healthcare workers have been facing challenges regarding their personal safety and that of their families. Consequently, we hypothesized the presence of high levels of burnout among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS To evaluate burnout in healthcare workers in French acute care geriatric facilities, we used an online survey based on the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory. Eighty-four healthcare workers answered the survey, during April of 2020. RESULTS Analysis demonstrated that they were experiencing medium levels of burnout, exhaustion, and disengagement. CONCLUSION This level of burnout reflected their fatigue, loss of energy, and/or feelings of being overextended and exhausted.

The sensitivity of the ELISA of 98.3% obtained for sera from day 14 after infection was superior to the Western blot (94.9%), the IFAT (96.6%) and the CFT (28.8%). No positive results were obtained in the ELISA and Western blot with 106 sera from horses not infected with Babesia spp. resulting in a calculated specificity of 100% for both tests. Cross reactions of B. equi-positive sera did occur to a larger extent in the ELISA (20%) than in the IFAT (4%). No cross reactions were observed with the Western blot and the CFT. The higher sensitivity of the ELISA was also demonstrated by testing of 132 field sera: more positive results were obtained by ELISA (112) as compared to IFAT (92) or CFT (41). The validity of these results was confirmed by testing of sera by Western blot. The ELISA as the most sensitive test provides the best method for the identification of carrier horses to prevent the introduction into non-endemic areas (export testing).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1994,"Böse, R; Peymann, B",International journal for parasitology,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8070952/,22291235.0

However, compared to open liver resection (OLR), the feasibility of laparoscopic anatomical liver resection for centrally located tumor (CLT) has not been clearly established. The aim of our study was to assess the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic anatomical major liver resection for CLT. METHODS From April 2011 to March 2016, 20 cases of anatomical LLR and 86 cases of OLR for CLTs such as central hepatectomy (CH) and right anterior sectionectomy (RAS) were performed at a single institution. We performed one-to-one propensity score matching and analyzed short-term outcomes between the LLR (n = 20) and OLR (n = 20) groups. RESULTS Among 20 cases in the LLR group, two cases underwent open conversion due to common bile duct injury and anatomical distortion, respectively. There were no statistically significant difference between the LLR and OLR groups regarding clamping time of the Pringle maneuver (p = 0.502), blood loss (p = 0.746), surgical margin (p = 0.198), or length of hospital stay (p = 0.110). However, surgical time was significantly longer in the LLR group than in the OLR group (388 vs 268 min; p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to morbidity rate or mean comprehensive complication index (p = 0.716 and p = 0.819, respectively). CONCLUSION Total anatomical LLR can be performed safely in selected CLT patients by experienced surgeons.

Our hypothesis is that use of subcutaneous sarilumab in early stages (window of opportunity) of COVID-19 moderate-severe pneumonia can prevent higher oxygenation requirements through non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation and decrease in-hospital stays, as well as death rate. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of sarilumab through hospitalisation and up to day 14 after discharge, compared to the control arm as assessed by incidence of serious and non serious adverse events (SAEs). In addition, as an exploratory objective, to compare the baseline clinical and biological parameters, including serum IL-6 levels, of the intervention population against controls of the same pandemic outbreak (using a propensity score) to search for markers that identify the best candidates for the treatment with subcutaneous IL-6R inhibitors and to attempt an approximation in the temporal frame of the “window of opportunity” TRIAL DESIGN: SARCOVID is an investigator-initiated single center randomised proof of concept study.

DESIGN: Retrospective observational study using electronic medical record data. SETTING: Five member hospitals from the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City (NYC). PARTICIPANTS: 28 336 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 from 24 February 2020 to 15 April 2020, including 6158 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Positive test rates and in-hospital mortality were assessed for different racial groups. Among positive cases admitted to the hospital (N=3273), we estimated HR for both discharge and death across various explanatory variables, including patient demographics, hospital site and unit, smoking status, vital signs, lab results and comorbidities. RESULTS: Hispanics (29%) and African Americans (25%) had disproportionately high positive case rates relative to their representation in the overall NYC population (p<0.05); however, no differences in mortality rates were observed in hospitalised patients based on race. Outcomes differed significantly between hospitals (Gray’s T=248.9; p<0.05), reflecting differences in average baseline age and underlying comorbidities. Significant risk factors for mortality included age (HR 1.05, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.06; p=1.15e-32), oxygen saturation (HR 0.985, 95% CI 0.982 to 0.988; p=1.57e-17), care in intensive care unit areas (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.92; p=7.81e-6) and elevated creatinine (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.10; p=7.48e-10), white cell count (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.04; p=8.4e-3) and body mass index (BMI) (HR 1.02, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.03; p=1.09e-2). Deceased patients were more likely to have elevated markers of inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: While race was associated with higher risk of infection, we did not find racial disparities in inpatient mortality suggesting that outcomes in a single tertiary care health system are comparable across races.

Our results show that a response system based on enhanced testing and contact tracing can have a major role in relaxing social-distancing interventions in the absence of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2.",2020-08-05,"Aleta, Alberto; Martín-Corral, David; Pastore Y Piontti, Ana; Ajelli, Marco; Litvinova, Maria; Chinazzi, Matteo; Dean, Natalie E; Halloran, M Elizabeth; Longini, Ira M; Merler, Stefano; Pentland, Alex; Vespignani, Alessandro; Moro, Esteban; Moreno, Yamir",Nature human behaviour,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-020-0931-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32759985/,220966521.0

We measured levels of total lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, CD56+ NK cells, and the serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta}), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), and interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}) by flow cytometry. We found that in most post-recovery patients, levels of total lymphocytes (66.67%), CD3+ T cells (54.55%), CD4+ T cells (54.55%), CD8 + T cells (81.82%), CD19+ B cells (69.70%), and CD56+ NK cells(51.52%) remained lower than normal, whereas most patients showed normal levels of IL-2 (100%), IL-4 (80.88%), IL-6 (79.41%), IL-10 (98.53%), TNF- (89.71%), IFN-{gamma} (100%) and IL-17 (97.06%). Compared to healthy controls, 2-week post-recovery patients had significantly lower absolute numbers of total lymphocytes, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD56+ NK cells, along with significantly higher levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, IFN-{gamma} and IL-17. Among post-recovery patients, T cells, particularly CD4+ T cells, were positively correlated with CD19+ B cell counts. Additionally, CD8+ T cells positively correlated with CD4+ T cells and IL-2 levels, and IL-6 positively correlated with TNF- and IFN-{gamma}. These correlations were not observed in healthy controls. By ROC curve analysis, post-recovery decreases in lymphocyte subsets and increases in cytokines were identified as independent predictors of rehabilitation efficacy. These findings indicate that the immune system has gradually recovered following COVID-19 infection; however, the sustained hyper-inflammatory response for more than 14 days suggests a need to continue medical observation following discharge from the hospital.

The best available evidence suggests that HIV newly infected the human species about 50–100 years ago (Korber et al., 2000). It did not originate in Asia. It apparently moved to people from sub-human primates in Africa (Keele et al., 2006; Kanki, 1997). Because of different clinical presentations in different populations of people, and a long incubation period, it was more difficult to diagnose than SARS or avian influenza. As a new epidemic that originated in the era of modern medicine, it taught us many lessons about the difficulties that a new infectious disease can present. Already claiming at least 60–80 million victims, AIDS seems destined to continue as a pandemic for the foreseeable future. Drugs that control HIV replication and reverse disease progression have been developed, but none eliminate the virus from the body. Sexual transmission can be prevented by abstinence or condoms, but such measures, which prevent procreation, provide only limited value. Approaches for making a vaccine using conventional techniques have failed. Most experts believe that an effective vaccine will be made eventually, but not for at least 10–20 years. We need to learn more about the immunobiology of acute HIV infection, and about potentially protective immunoepitopes, such as conformational intermediates of the virus envelope. Until a vaccine is available, there is little or no chance that HIV can be eliminated, or even drastically reduced in prevalence.

METHODS: We used PubMed and Scopus to search international medical databases. The key words were as follows: Hajj, Haj, vaccine, vaccination, and immunization. The time interval of the search was from the beginning of 2010 to May 23, 2016. One hundred and thirty papers were extracted, and their contents were subsequently reviewed after title and abstract screenings. The original articles were included in the study and non-English articles were excluded from the study. RESULTS: Considering the extracted papers, almost all pilgrims were vaccinated against meningococcal diseases. Using of influenza and pneumococcal vaccine rates were different among the pilgrims. The other vaccines have been taking according to specific conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The findings regarding influenza vaccine effectiveness are contradictory.

In this overview, we attempt to define the criteria that could explain such a difference. Among these criteria, the specificity of Lactobacillus genus strains, as a part of nasal microbiota, could play a role of a barrier against viral penetration and could strengthen the host's immune system in some populations rather than others. In fact, several studies have shown the role of lactic acid bacteria, including lactobacilli, in the prevention of viral respiratory infections.

We show that purely mathematical procedures for site selection should be supervised by known phylogeny (i) to ensure that solid tree branches are represented instead of mutational hotspots with poor phylogeographic proprieties, and (ii) to avoid phylogenetic redundancy. We propose a procedure that prevents information redundancy in site selection by considering the cumulative informativeness of previously selected sites (as a proxy for phylogenetic-based criteria). This procedure demonstrates that, for short barcodes (e.g., 11 sites), there are thousands of informative site combinations that improve previous proposals. We also show that barcodes based on worldwide databases inevitably prioritize variants located at the basal nodes of the phylogeny, such that most representative genomes in these ancestral nodes are no longer in circulation. Consequently, coronavirus phylodynamics cannot be properly captured by universal genomic barcodes because most SARS-CoV-2 variation is generated in geographically restricted areas by the continuous introduction of domestic variants.",2021,"Pardo-Seco, Jacobo; Gómez-Carballa, Alberto; Bello, Xabier; Martinón-Torres, Federico; Salas, Antonio",Zool Res,,#1013621,,,,,230824854.0

Methods: Phone interviews and follow-ups were completed with 112 mild COVID-19 RT-PCR-positive adult patients, over a 6 week period. Results: More than one symptom at disease onset was experienced by ~70 of the patients. Over one third of patients experienced fever, dry cough, headache, or muscle ache as the first symptom. If fatigue was reported, it was usually the first symptom to appear. Smell and taste changes had occurred 3.9 {+/-} 5.4 and 4.6 {+/-} 5.7 days (mean {+/-} SD) since disease onset and emerged as first symptoms in 15% and 18% of patients, respectively.

Design education has a critical role to play in this transformation, as design is a materially engaged, world-building activity. Design is complicit in the problems we are facing, and informs and shapes how people live. In this article, I seed ideas about design research education for global challenges. I speak to the merits of post-disciplinary and hybrid strategies, and look to science for clues about how to respond to twenty-first-century challenges through design. I posit sustainability brokering as a new pathway for design, and anticipating alternative futures as a critical step in developing transformative innovation. I then propose participatory research through design as a foundational methodology; describe four pillars of practice to scaffold sophisticated research at undergraduate and master’s level; and lay out a work plan for building research capacity in a doctoral school. Through this process, I articulate core skills that design researchers will likely require if they are to contribute to global challenges constructively.

This method simultaneously detects influenza viruses A and B in specimens of patients with respiratory infections using a TaqMan-based real-time PCR assay. Primers and probes were selected from highly conserved regions of the matrix protein gene of influenza virus A and the hemagglutinin gene segment of influenza virus B. The applicability of this multiplex PCR was evaluated with 27 influenza virus A and 9 influenza virus B reference strains and isolates. In addition, the specificity of the assay was assessed using eight reference strains of other respiratory viruses (parainfluenza viruses 1 to 3, respiratory syncytial virus Long strain, rhinoviruses 1A and 14, and coronaviruses OC43 and 229E) and 30 combined nose and throat swabs from asymptomatic subjects.

OBJECTIVE: The present study examined the psychological responses toward COVID-19 among university students in three countries (Indonesia, Taiwan, and Thailand). METHODS: Using a cross-sectional online survey, university students from five public universities (two in Indonesia, two in Thailand, one in Taiwan) were recruited via popular social media sites, including Facebook, LINE, broadcast WhatsApp. All the students (938 in Indonesia, 734 in Thailand, 313 in Taiwan) completed questions concerning their anxiety, suicidal thoughts, confidence in COVID-19 pandemic control, risk perception in susceptibility to COVID-19, perceived support, resources for fighting COVID-19, and sources of COVID-19 information. RESULTS: Thai students had the highest levels of anxiety and suicidal thoughts but the lowest levels of confidence in pandemic control and available resources of fighting COVID-19 among the four student groups. Factors associated with higher anxiety and suicidal thoughts differed across countries. Less perceived satisfactory support was associated with more suicidal thoughts among Indonesian and Thai students.

The spread of COVID-19 seems to have a detrimental effect on the global economy and health. A positive chest X-ray of infected patients is a crucial step in the battle against COVID-19. Early results suggest that abnormalities exist in chest X-rays of patients suggestive of COVID-19. This has led to the introduction of a variety of deep learning systems and studies have shown that the accuracy of COVID-19 patient detection through the use of chest X-rays is strongly optimistic. Deep learning networks like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) need a substantial amount of training data. Because the outbreak is recent, it is difficult to gather a significant number of radiographic images in such a short time. Therefore, in this research, we present a method to generate synthetic chest X-ray (CXR) images by developing an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ACGAN) based model called CovidGAN. In addition, we demonstrate that the synthetic images produced from CovidGAN can be utilized to enhance the performance of CNN for COVID-19 detection. Classification using CNN alone yielded 85% accuracy. By adding synthetic images produced by CovidGAN,the accuracy increased to 95%. We hope this method will speed up COVID-19 detection and lead to more robust systems of radiology.",2020,"Waheed, Abdul; Goyal, Muskan; Gupta, Deepak; Khanna, Ashish; Al-Turjman, Fadi; Pinheiro, Placido Rogerio",IEEE Access,,#613169,,,,,218894527.0

With flexible endoscopy readily available in this setting, we sought to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of a transgastric natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) peritoneoscopy vs. laparoscopic exploration in the identification of intra-abdominal pathology in a porcine model. METHODS In this acute study, 15 pigs were randomized to demonstrate 0 to 4 pathologic lesions: small bowel ischemia (SBI), small bowel perforation (SBP), colon perforation (CP), and gangrenous cholecystitis (GC). Two blinded surgical endoscopists were allowed 60 min to perform NOTES or laparoscopy (LAP) to correctly identify or exclude each lesion. A prototype endoscope (R-scope, Olympus, Inc), which enables independent instrument mobility, was used in the NOTES arm. RESULTS When considering all lesions, LAP was more sensitive diagnostically than NOTES (77.4% vs. 61.3%) overall. LAP also displayed a slightly higher NPV compared with NOTES (79.4% vs. 70.7%). However, NOTES was 100% specific with 100% positive predictive value (PPV) compared with 93.1% and 92.3% with LAP, respectively. Individually, NOTES was found most sensitive with CP identification (87.5%) and least sensitive with SBP (37.5%). The sensitivity of NOTES for SBI and GC was 62.5% and 57.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The utilization of NOTES as a diagnostic tool may have an important role in the critically ill patient when operative intervention is highly morbid. Although it may be overall inferior diagnostically compared with laparoscopy, a positive identification was highly specific with a strong predictive value. Further investigation addressing an improved small bowel evaluation technique would be beneficial.

Thermal ablation refers to the focal destruction of tissue by generating cytotoxic temperatures in the treatment zone. Hydrodissection - separating tissues with fluids - protects healthy tissues adjacent to the ablation treatment zone to improve procedural safety, and facilitate more aggressive power application or applicator placement. However, fluids such as normal saline and 5% dextrose in water (D5W) can migrate into the peritoneum, reducing their protective efficacy. As an alternative, a thermo-gelable poloxamer 407 (P407) solution has been recently developed to facilitate hydrodissection procedures. We hypothesise that the P407 gel material does not provide convective heat dissipation from the ablation site, and therefore may alter the heat transfer dynamics compared to liquid materials during hydrodissection-assisted thermal ablation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the heat dissipation mechanics within D5W, liquid P407 and gel P407 hydrodissection barriers. Overall it was shown that the gel P407 dissipated heat primarily through conduction, whereas the liquid P407 and D5W dissipated heat through convection. Furthermore, the rate of temperature change within the gel P407 was greater than liquid P407 and D5W.

Proteins with specific structural features including constricting rings, helical scaffolds, and hydrophobic membrane insertions are thought to be the primary drivers of fission. In contrast, here we report a mechanism of fission that is independent of protein structure-steric pressure among membrane-bound proteins. In particular, random collisions among crowded proteins generate substantial pressure, which if unbalanced on the opposite membrane surface can dramatically increase membrane curvature, leading to fission. Using the endocytic protein epsin1 N-terminal homology domain (ENTH), previously thought to drive fission by hydrophobic insertion, our results show that membrane coverage correlates equally with fission regardless of the hydrophobicity of insertions. Specifically, combining FRET-based measurements of membrane coverage with multiple, independent measurements of membrane vesiculation revealed that fission became spontaneous as steric pressure increased. Further, fission efficiency remained equally potent when helices were replaced by synthetic membrane-binding motifs. These data challenge the view that hydrophobic insertions drive membrane fission, suggesting instead that the role of insertions is to anchor proteins strongly to membrane surfaces, amplifying steric pressure. In line with these conclusions, even green fluorescent protein (GFP) was able to drive fission efficiently when bound to the membrane at high coverage. Our conclusions are further strengthened by the finding that intrinsically disordered proteins, which have large hydrodynamic radii yet lack a defined structure, drove fission with substantially greater potency than smaller, structured proteins.",2017,"Snead, Wilton T; Hayden, Carl C; Gadok, Avinash K; Zhao, Chi; Lafer, Eileen M; Rangamani, Padmini; Stachowiak, Jeanne C",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1616199114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28373566/,916530.0

However, when and whether LSD can be considered is subject to the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the recovery rate, and the case-fatality rate. It is imperative to provide real-time assessment of three factors to guide LSD. OBJECTIVE: A simple LSD index was developed for health decision makers to do real-time assessment of COVID-19 at the global, country, region, and community level. METHODS: Data on the retrospective cohort of 186 countries with three factors were retrieved from a publicly available repository from January to early July. A simple index for guiding LSD was measured by the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and recoveries, and the case-fatality rate was envisaged. If the LSD index was less than 1, LSD can be considered. The dynamic changes of the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated to assess whether and when health decision makers allowed for LSD and when to reimplement social distancing after resurgences of the epidemic. RESULTS: After large-scale outbreaks in a few countries before mid-March (prepandemic phase), the global weekly LSD index peaked at 4.27 in March and lasted until mid-June (pandemic phase), during which most countries were affected and needed to take various social distancing measures. Since, the value of LSD has gradually declined to 0.99 on July 5 (postpandemic phase), at which 64.7% (120/186) of countries and regions had an LSD<1 with the decile between 0 and 1 to refine risk stratification by countries. The LSD index decreased to 1 in about 115 days.

Methods: Levels of CGRP in the serum of 57 COVID-19 patients (24 asymptomatic, 23 hospitalized in the general ward, and 10 admitted to the intensive care unit) and healthy donors (n=24) were measured by ELISA. In addition, to better understand the physiological consequences of the observed variations, we investigated by immunofluorescence the distribution of RAMP1, one of the components of the CGRP receptor, in autopsy lung specimens. Results: CGRP levels greatly decreased in COVID-19 patients (p<0.001) when compared to controls, and there were no significant differences due to disease severity, sex, age, or comorbidities. We found that COVID-19 patients treated with proton pump inhibitors had lower levels of CGRP than other patients not taking this treatment (p=0.001). RAMP1 immunoreactivity was found in smooth muscle cells of large blood vessels and the bronchial tree, and in the airways epithelium. In COVID-19 samples, RAMP1 was also found in proliferating type II pneumocytes, a common finding in these patients. Conclusions: The lower levels of CGRP should negatively impact the respiratory physiology of COVID-19 patients due to vasoconstriction, improper angiogenesis, less epithelial repair, and faulty immune response. Therefore, restoring CGRP levels in these patients may represent a novel therapeutic approach for COVID-19.",2020-10-02,"Ochoa-Callejero, L.; Garcia-Sanmartin, J.; Villoslada-Blanco, P.; Iniguez, M.; Perez-Matute, P.; Brody, R.; Oteo, J.

Devices such as barrier boxes are being considered as potential adjuncts to full PPE’s to limit the aerosol spread. Usage of the barrier box raises concerns of delay in time to intubate (TTI). We designed our study to determine if using a barrier box with glidescope delays TTI within acceptable parameters to make relevant clinical conclusions. METHODS: Seventy-eight patients were enrolled in this prospective non-inferiority controlled trial and were randomly allocated to either group C (without the barrier box) or the study group BB (using barrier box). The primary measured endpoint is time to intubate (TTI), which is defined as time taken from loss of twitches confirmed with a peripheral nerve stimulator to confirmation of end-tidal CO (2.) 15 s was used as non-inferiority margin for the purpose of the study. We used an unpaired two-sample single-sided t-test to test our non- inferiority hypothesis (H (0): Mean TTI diff ≥15 s, H (A): Mean TTI diff < 15 s). Secondary endpoints include the number of attempts at intubation, lowest oxygen saturation during induction, and the need for bag-mask ventilation. RESULTS: Mean TTI in group C was 42 s (CI 19.2 to 64.8) vs. 52.1 s (CI 26.1 to 78) in group BB. The difference in mean TTI was 10.1 s (CI -∞ to 14.9). We rejected the null hypothesis and concluded with 95% confidence that the difference of the mean TTI between the groups is less than < 15 s (95% CI -∞ to 14.9,p = 0.0461). Our induction times were comparable (67.7 vs. 65.9 s).100% of our patients were intubated on the first attempt in both groups. None of our patients needed rescue breaths. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that in patients with normal airway exam, scheduled for elective surgeries, our barrier box did not cause any clinically significant delay in TTI when airway manipulation is performed by well-trained providers.

The disease is notably severe in elderly and those with underlying chronic conditions. A molecular mechanism that explains why the elderly are vulnerable and why children are resistant is largely unknown. Here we show loading cells with cholesterol from blood serum using the cholesterol transport protein apolipoprotein E (apoE) enhances the entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 and the infectivity of the virion. Super resolution imaging of the SARS-CoV-2 entry point with high cholesterol shows almost twice the total number of endocytic entry points. Cholesterol concomitantly traffics angiotensinogen converting enzyme (ACE2) to the endocytic entry site where SARS-CoV-2 presumably docks to efficiently exploit entry into the cell. Furthermore, in cells producing virus, cholesterol optimally positions furin for priming SARS-CoV-2, producing a more infectious virion with improved binding to the ACE2 receptor. In vivo, age and high fat diet induces cholesterol loading by up to 40% and trafficking of ACE2 to endocytic entry sites in lung tissue from mice. We propose a component of COVID19 severity based on tissue cholesterol level and the sensitivity of ACE2 and furin to cholesterol.

All patients from our IBD unit were informed via email, social networks and websites about the convenience of continuing with treatment. In addition, patients were contacted by telephone a few days before to remind them of their appointment and the importance of adherence1. In our center, 164 patients were on an intravenous biological treatment (infliximab or vedolizumab) and had an appointment at the outpatient clinic during the confinement period in Madrid from March 16 to May 2, 2020. Thirty patients (18.3%) were identified whose treatment was not administered on the indicated date. The infusion of the biological treatment was delayed for a mean 27.9 days (2.9 - 60.9 days) and from the last administration for a mean 68.5 days (SD: 21.24). The reason was fear of going to the hospital due to COVID-19 in 43.3% of cases (13 patients). Most (8, 61.5%) patients were males with a mean age of 49.6 years and had Crohn's disease (92.3%). In 20% (6 patients) of cases, the reason was due to a confirmed COVID-19 infection, being outside of Madrid in 26.7% (8 patients) and forgetfulness in 3 patients.

Referral from smaller peripheral hospitals to higher centers for intensive care is common. However, lack of an organized referral and feedback system compromises optimal care. We studied the quality of referral letters coming to our Emergency Department (ED) with respect to their demography, association with severity of illness and mortality before and after referral education. METHODS: Our study was completed in three phases in the Pediatric ED; Pre-intervention, Intervention and Post intervention phases. Quality of referral letter was matched with a quality checklist proforma and graded as ‘good’, ‘fair’ and ‘poor’ if it scored > 7, 5–7 and < 5 points respectively. A peer reviewed referral education module was prepared using case studies, expert opinions, and lacunae observed in the first phase and administered to health care providers (HCP’s) of referring hospitals. Quality of referral letter was compared between pre and post intervention phases. RESULTS: Most referrals belonged to the neighboring states of Punjab (48.2%) and Haryana (22.4%). Major referring hospitals were from public sector (80.9%), of which the teaching hospitals topped the list (53.6%). Government run ambulance services (85.5%) was commonest mode of transport used and need for a PICU bed and/or mechanical ventilation (50.4%) was the commonest reason for referral.

This mimicry may pose a challenge, as the management of both diseases is quite different. Furthermore, the temporal association of initiating treatment affects prognosis. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mainly infects the pulmonary system. However, in a patient with concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis, it can be a diagnostic challenge. CASE REPORT A 28-year-old man of Indian origin presented with headache and vomiting. He had a brain mass on imaging suggestive of a glioma. He also had lung infiltrates and was diagnosed with a co-infection by SARS-CoV-2, by a reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the GeneXpert system. The mass was excised and was found to be a tuberculoma, diagnosed by Xpert MTB. He received first-line anti-TB and treatment for COVID-19 pneumonia based on local guidelines. CONCLUSIONS This report highlights that COVID-19 can co-exist with other infectious diseases, such as TB. A high degree of clinical suspicion is required to detect TB with atypical presentation. A co-infection of pulmonary and CNS TB with COVID-19 can present a diagnostic challenge, and appropriate patient management relies on an accurate and rapid diagnosis.

Therefore, reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) was used to detect viral RNA in respiratory secretions. A single‐tube nested RT‐PCR that used primers from a conserved F gene sequence was developed using a “hanging droplet” to physically separate outer and inner primer pairs during the first round of the PCR reaction. This was accomplished by placing the inner primers in a 5 μL droplet on the underside on the reaction tube cap and mixing after the first round of PCR. As few as 0.05 pfu of virus could be detected and gave positive results with RSV strains that represented the major groups and subgroups of RSV grown in tissue culture. The nested PCR was ∼100‐fold more sensitive than standard single primer PCR reactions and equivalent to standard two‐tube nested PCR. Viral RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal samples from 12 of 15 culture positive illnesses and in 5 of 17 culture‐negative, seropositive illnesses despite specimen volumes less than 1 μL in some samples. The method was also positive in 14 of 25 elderly volunteers inoculated with a live attenuated RSV vaccine candidate, only one of whom was culture positive.

However, the broad and general use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine has resulted in the development of multi-resistant strains of bacteria with limited to no response to existing treatments and the need for alternative treatment options. The combined specificity and flexibility of antibody-based treatments makes them very valuable tools for designing specific antibody treatments to infectious agents. These attributes have already caused a revolution in new antibody-based treatments in oncology and inflammatory diseases, with many approved products. However, only one monoclonal antibody, palivizumab, for the prevention and treatment of respiratory syncytial virus, is approved for infectious diseases. The high cost of monoclonal antibody therapies, the need for parallel development of diagnostics, and the relatively small markets are major barriers for their development in the presence of cheap antibiotics. It is time to take a new and revised look into the future to find appropriate niches in infectious diseases where new antibody-based treatments or combinations with existing antibiotics, could prove their value and serve as stepping stones for broader acceptance of the potential for and value of these treatments.",2015,"Hey, Adam",Microbiology spectrum,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1128/microbiolspec.aid-0026-2014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26104697/,35296264.0

METHODS A prospective, qualitative, interventional study performed in a tertiary university hospital. Healthy volunteers were asked to wear three different professional surgical facemasks while air leaks around the eyes were monitored. Three types of masks were investigated: A) surgical facemask with 4 tying strips, B) surgical facemask with elastic ear loops, and C) 2200 N95 TB particulate facemask. For each session the periocular area was inspected for air leak during normal respiration, speech, and deep respiration. Detection of air leak was performed using two professional thermal cameras: FLIR A310 -thermal camera; and EyeCGas 2.0 -super sensitive infrared camera used for detection of minute fugitive emissions of industrial gases. RESULTS Ten healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. The experiment was repeated 45 times for each camera: three times, for each of three mask types, on five volunteers, for a total of 90 trials. Air jets were detected originating from the superior edges of the masks radiating towards the eyes in 81% (73/90) of cases in total; 71% (32/45) with the FLIR camera and 91% (41/45) with the OPGAL camera. Air leaks were detected with all investigated mask types. CONCLUSIONS Patients wearing facemasks during intravitreal injections may be at higher risk of endophthalmitis.

We wish to determine if our preoperative frailty screen would predict postoperative LOI. METHODS: This single-institutional study included demographical, procedural, and outcome data from patients ≥65 years who underwent frailty screening prior to a surgical procedure. Frailty was assessed using the Edmonton Frailty Score (EFS). The Operative Severity Score was used to categorize procedures. The Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) risk-adjustment score as calculated by CMS was included. LOI was defined as an increase in support outside of the home following discharge. Univariable, multivariable logistic regressions, and adjusted post-estimation analyses for predictive probabilities of best fit were performed. RESULTS: 535 patients met inclusion and LOI was seen in 38 (7%) patients. Patients with LOI were older, had a lower BMI, a higher EFS score (7vs.3.0, p<0.001), and a higher HCC score than patients without LOI. Being frail and undergoing a procedure with an OSS ≥ 3 was independently associated with an increased risk of LOI. In addition, social dependency, depression, and limited mobility was associated with an increased risk for LOI. On multivariable modeling, frailty status, undergoing a surgery with an OSS ≥ 3, and having an HCC score ≥ 1 was the most predictive of LOI (OR 12.72, 95% CI: 12.04, 13.44, p<0.001). In addition, self-reported depression, weight loss, and limited mobility was associated with a nearly 11-fold increase risk in postoperative LOI.

The spike is a type I membrane glycoprotein that possesses a conserved transmembrane anchor and an unusual cysteine-rich (cys) domain that bridges the putative junction of the anchor and the cytoplasmic tail. In this study, we examined the role of these carboxyl-terminal domains in spike-mediated membrane fusion. We show that the cytoplasmic tail is not required for fusion but has the capacity to enhance membrane fusion activity. Chimeric spike protein mutants containing substitutions of the entire transmembrane anchor and cys domain with the herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein D (gD-1) anchor demonstrated that fusion activity requires the presence of the A59 membrane-spanning domain and the portion of the cys domain that lies upstream of the cytoplasmic tail. The cys domain is a required element since its deletion from the wild-type spike protein abrogates fusion activity. However, addition of the cys domain to fusion-defective chimeric proteins was unable to restore fusion activity. Thus, the cys domain is necessary but is not sufficient to complement the gD-1 anchor and allow for membrane fusion. Site-specific mutations of conserved cysteine residues in the cys domain markedly reduce membrane fusion, which further supports the conclusion that this region is crucial for spike function. The results indicate that the carboxyl-terminus of the spike transmembrane anchor contains at least two distinct domains, both of which are necessary for full membrane fusion.",2000-03-30,"Chang, Kevin W.; Sheng, YiWei; Gombold, James L.",Virology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/fced9d531863f4bbf4bba0e1192adba213298bcf.json,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682200902198; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682200902198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10725213/,41467769.0

With diligent hand disinfection reinforced during COVID-19, there is an increased prevalence of contact dermatitis. This commentary highlights the fact that contact dermatitis is a readily treatable condition and should not cause any deviation of proper hand hygiene. In irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), the management strategies are selection of less irritating hand hygiene products, frequent use of moisturisers to rebuild the skin barrier, and education on proper hand hygiene practices. In allergic contact dermatitis (ACD), the identification and avoidance of the contact allergen is the key to treatment. However, ACD is less common and only accounts for 20% of the cases.

The respiratory effects of prolonged respirator use on pregnant women are unclear although there has been no definite evidence of harm from past use. METHODS: We conducted a two-phase controlled clinical study on healthy pregnant women between 27 to 32 weeks gestation. In phase I, energy expenditure corresponding to the workload of routine nursing tasks was determined. In phase II, pulmonary function of 20 subjects was measured whilst at rest and exercising to the predetermined workload while breathing ambient air first, then breathing through N95-mask materials. RESULTS: Exercising at 3 MET while breathing through N95-mask materials reduced mean tidal volume (TV) by 23.0 % (95 % CI −33.5 % to −10.5 %, p < 0.001) and lowered minute ventilation (VE) by 25.8 % (95 % CI −34.2 % to −15.8 %, p < 0.001), with no significant change in breathing frequency compared to breathing ambient air. Volumes of oxygen consumption (VO(2)) and carbon dioxide expired (VCO(2)) were also significantly reduced; VO(2) by 13.8 % (95 % CI −24.2 % to −3 %, p = 0.013) and VCO(2) by 17.7 %, (95 % CI −28.1 % to −8.6 %, p = 0.001). Although no changes in the inspired oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations were demonstrated, breathing through N95-mask materials during low intensity work (3 MET) reduced expired oxygen concentration by 3.2 % (95 % CI: −4.1 % to −2.2 %, p < 0.001), and increased expired carbon dioxide by 8.9 % (95 % CI: 6.9 % to 13.1 %; p <0.001) suggesting an increase in metabolism. There were however no changes in the maternal and fetal heart rates, finger-tip capillary lactate levels and oxygen saturation and rating of perceived exertion at the work intensity investigated. CONCLUSIONS: Breathing through N95 mask materials have been shown to impede gaseous exchange and impose an additional workload on the metabolic system of pregnant healthcare workers, and this needs to be taken into consideration in guidelines for respirator use. The benefits of using N95 mask to prevent serious emerging infectious diseases should be weighed against potential respiratory consequences associated with extended N95 respirator usage.

It is commonly believed that this bacterium avoids major immune recognition by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) because of low intrinsic activity of its flagellin and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In particular, TLR5 specifically detects flagellins in various bacterial pathogens, while Hp evolved mutations in flagellin to evade detection through TLR5. Cancerogenic Hp strains encode a type IV secretion system (T4SS). The T4SS core component and pilus-associated protein CagY, a large VirB10 ortholog, drives effector molecule translocation. Here, we identify CagY as a flagellin-independent TLR5 agonist. We detect five TLR5 interaction sites, promoting binding of CagY-positive Hp to TLR5-expressing cells, TLR5 stimulation, and intracellular signal transduction.

A potential limitation to the use of in vitro assay data in regulatory decision-making is the lack of coverage for xenobiotic metabolic processes. Both hepatic- and peripheral-tissue metabolism can yield metabolites that exhibit greater activity than the parent compound (bioactivation) or are inactive (bioinactivation) for a given biological target. Interpretation of biological effect data for both putative EAS, as well as other chemicals, screened in HTS assays may benefit from the addition of xenobiotic metabolic capabilities to decrease the uncertainty in predicting potential hazards to human health. The objective of this study was to develop an approach to retrofit existing HTS assays with hepatic metabolism. The Alginate Immobilization of Metabolic Enzymes (AIME) platform encapsulates hepatic S9 fractions in alginate microspheres attached to 96-well peg lids. Functional characterization across a panel of reference substrates for phase I cytochrome P450 enzymes revealed substrate depletion with expected metabolite accumulation. Performance of the AIME method in the VM7Luc estrogen receptor (ER) transactivation assay was evaluated across 15 reference chemicals and 48 test chemicals that yield metabolites previously identified as ER active or inactive.

Some of these mono-ARTDs feature antiviral activity while certain RNA viruses, including Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), encode mono-ADP-ribosylhydrolases, suggesting a role for mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) in host-virus conflicts. CHIKV expresses four non-structural proteins (nsP1-nsP4), with nsP3 containing a macrodomain that hydrolyzes and thereby reverses protein MARylation in vitro and in cells. This de-MARylation activity is essential as hydrolase inactivating mutations result in replication defective virus. However, the substrates of MARylation during CHIKV infection are unknown and thus it is unclear how the macrodomain contributes to virus replication and how mono-ARTD-dependent MARylation confers antiviral immunity. We identified ARTD10 and ARTD12 as restriction factors for CHIKV replication in a catalytic activity-dependent manner. CHIKV replication requires processing of the non-structural polyprotein nsP1-4 by the nsP2-encoded protease and the assembly of the four individual nsPs into a functional replication complex. Expression of ARTD10 and ARTD12 resulted in a reduction of processed nsPs. Similarly, MAR hydrolase inactive CHIKV replicon mutants revealed a decrease in processed nsPs, comparable to an nsP2 protease defective mutant. This suggested that the macrodomain contributes to nsP2 protease activity. In support, a hydrolase-deficient virus was complemented by a protease-deficient virus. We hypothesized that MARylation regulates the proteolytic function of nsP2. Indeed, we found that nsP2 is MARylated by ARTD10. This inhibited nsP2 protease activity, thereby preventing polyprotein processing and consequently virus replication. This inhibition was antagonized by the MAR hydrolase activity of nsP3. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the need of the viral MAR hydrolase for efficient replication of CHIKV. Author Summary Infectious diseases still pose major health threats. Especially fast evolving viruses find ever new strategies to manipulate the immune response. With climate warming and increased human mobility vector-borne pathogens like Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) spread and cause world-wide epidemics. Beyond the acute phase, CHIKV patients regularly suffer from chronic rheumatism. This entails a decline in life quality and an economic burden. To date no drugs are approved and the mode of pathogenesis remains elusive. Here we describe a mechanistic function of the CHIKV nsP3 macrodomain. We found that the viral nsP2 is mono-ADP-ribosylated interfering with its auto-proteolytic function. The nsP3 macrodomain removes this modification and restores the protease activity that is essential for replication. Because macrodomains are highly conserved they might represent broad antiviral targets.",2020-01-08,"Krieg, Sarah; Pott, Fabian; Eckei, Laura; Verheirstraeten, Maud; Bütepage, Mareike; Lippok, Barbara; Goffinet, Christine; Lüscher, Bernhard; Verheugd, Patricia",bioRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/09c9fcabc66a106e01ef42247cbd86b6d85bd67f.json; document_parses/pdf_json/00fe67432e35cea2b225647e42f5e919961087d9.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.07.896977,213099425.0

To accomplish this purpose, approximately 800 peer-reviewed articles describing original research were evaluated for scientific impact, popular media attention, and reputations of the scientists/authors and publication venue. A structural equation model was produced describing the relationship between non-scientific impact (popular media) and scientific impact (citations), while accounting for author/scientist and journal reputation. The resulting model revealed a strong association between the amount of popular media attention given to a scientific research project and corresponding publication and the number of times that publication is cited in peer-reviewed scientific literature. These results indicate that (1) peer-reviewed scientific publications receiving more attention in non-scientific media are more likely to be cited than scientific publications receiving less popular media attention, and (2) the non-scientific media is associated with the scientific agenda.

However, the impact on patients is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the psychological and economic impact of the cancellation of scheduled spinal operations. METHODS: We identified 50 patients with cancelled surgeries between 16 March 2020 and 24 April 2020. Forty-nine (98%) participants were contacted, with whom the modified WES-Pi questionnaire was filled in during a telephone interview. RESULTS: Of the 49 respondents, 28 (57.2%) were aged <65 years. The most often reported problem (85.7%) was an ongoing limitation in basic daily activities. At least moderate sadness was experienced by 65.3% and disappointment by 73.5% of the patients. More than 80% reported concerns about the continuation and 73.5% about the progression of their symptoms. Out of 27 employees (55.1%), 63% could not work due to severe pain or movement limitation (p < .001). The inability to work was associated with anger (p = .037). The work-related impact of the cancellation was associated with stress (p < .0001) and concerns about continuing the symptoms (p = .004). Two-third of patients would undergo immediate surgery despite the current epidemic situation. CONCLUSIONS: The cancellations of elective spinal surgeries have a serious psychological impact on patients.

The proper self-regulation of emotions allows to tolerate frustrations, improves social skills and healthy bonds with peers and adults in the environment (Bisquerra, 2003, p. 12). The lack of regulation causes discomfort that leads to a decrease in academic performance (Graziano, Reavis, Keanes & Calkins, 2006) and particularly in reading comprehension, because this competence requires motivation and cognitive processes that will allow to process the linguistic code, interpret it and represent it symbolically (Alonso-Tapia, 2005, p. 64). In this work, we show the essential relationship between emotional regulation and reading comprehension in primary school students. After that, we study the effect of lockdown on these two processes.

The results inform that the students and their parents have difficulties to regulate their emotions and this emotional struggle has a negative impact on comprehension of texts. The problems that previously presented in these two areas have increased due to the lack of adaptation of activities by teachers, the lack of knowledge of their parents to help them and the difficulty in accessing digital technologies.

There is a lack of evidence-based literature providing clinical and organizational guidelines for the management of a general surgery department. Aim of our study was to review the available recommendations published by general Surgery Societies and Health Institutions and evaluate the underlying Literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of the English Literature was conducted according to the AMSTAR and to the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: After eligibility assessment, a total of 22 papers and statements were analyzed. Surgical societies have established criteria for triage and prioritization in order to identify procedures that can be postponed after the pandemic and those that should not. Prioritization among oncologic cases represents a difficult task: clinicians have to balance a possible delay in cancer diagnosis or treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure. There is broad agreement among guidelines that indication to proceed with surgery should be discussed in virtual Tumor Boards taking into consideration alternative therapeutic approaches. Several guidelines deal with the role of laparoscopic surgery during the pandemic: a tailored approach is currently suggested, with a case-by-case evaluation provided that appropriate personal protective equipment is available in order to minimize the potential risk of transmission. Finally, there is a considerable agreement in the published Literature concerning the management of the personnel during the peri- and intraoperative phase and on the technical advices regarding the induction, operative and recover maneuvers in COVID-19 cases.

312127,0lke0ut0,,WHO,Delaying surgery for clinical T1b-T2bN0M0 renal cell carcinoma: Oncologic implications in the COVID-19 era and beyond,,,,unk,"PURPOSE: During COVID-19, many operating rooms were reserved exclusively for emergent cases. As a result, many elective surgeries for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were deferred, with an unknown impact on outcomes. Since surveillance is commonplace for small renal masses, we focused on larger, organ-confined RCCs. Our primary endpoint was pT3a upstaging and our secondary endpoint was overall survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively abstracted cT1b-T2bN0M0 RCC patients from the National Cancer Database, stratifying them by clinical stage and time from diagnosis to surgery. We selected only those patients who underwent surgery. Patients were grouped by having surgery within 1 month, 1-3 months, or >3 months after diagnosis. Logistic regression models measured pT3a upstaging risk. Kaplan Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards models assessed overall survival. RESULTS: A total of 29,746 patients underwent partial or radical nephrectomy. Delaying surgery >3 months after diagnosis did not confer pT3a upstaging risk among cT1b (ORâ¯=â¯0.90; 95% CI: 0.77-1.05, Pâ¯=â¯0.170), cT2a (ORâ¯=â¯0.90; 95% CI: 0.69-1.19, Pâ¯=â¯0.454), or cT2b (ORâ¯=â¯0.96; 95% CI: 0.62-1.51, Pâ¯=â¯0.873). In all clinical stage strata, nonclear cell RCCs were significantly less likely to be upstaged (P <0.001). A sensitivity analysis, performed for delays of <1, 1-3, 3-6, and >6 months, also showed no increase in upstaging risk. CONCLUSION: Delaying surgery up to, and even beyond, 3 months does not significantly increase risk of tumor progression in clinically localized RCC.

The complex virology of COVID-19 may provide multiple potential target points for antiviral therapy, and vaccines; extensive global research is underway to exploit these potential opportunities. The complex pathophysiology, pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease, and immune mediated effects such as cytokine storm, make medical management more challenging than many viral illnesses. Non medication based interventions including hyperbaric oxygen, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, aggressive dialysis, and other interventions, all with various degrees of clinical success, and will be discussed in this section. Several antivirals approved for other clinical indications were studied for repurposing against COVID-19, which we highlight, again with varying results. In addition to therapeutics, concern was raised over potential risks associated with ACE inhibitors and ARB use, which is presented. Often the timing of the medication determined its clinical benefit as will be discussed with dexamethasone and other medications. As such, this Therapeutics Review will present prominent and/or promising medications and therapeutic approaches with the caveats that 1.

Since the first person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was reported in Italy on February 21(st), 2020, the number of people infected with SARS-COV-2 increased rapidly, mainly in northern Italian regions, including Piedmont. A strict lockdown was imposed on March 21(st) until May 4(th) when a gradual relaxation of the restrictions started. In this context, computational models and computer simulations are one of the available research tools that epidemiologists can exploit to understand the spread of the diseases and to evaluate social measures to counteract, mitigate or delay the spread of the epidemic. METHODS: This study presents an extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed-Susceptible (SEIRS) model accounting for population age structure. The infectious population is divided into three sub-groups: (i) undetected infected individuals, (ii) quarantined infected individuals and (iii) hospitalized infected individuals. Moreover, the strength of the government restriction measures and the related population response to these are explicitly represented in the model. RESULTS: The proposed model allows us to investigate different scenarios of the COVID-19 spread in Piedmont and the implementation of different infection-control measures and testing approaches. The results show that the implemented control measures have proven effective in containing the epidemic, mitigating the potential dangerous impact of a large proportion of undetected cases. We also forecast the optimal combination of individual-level measures and community surveillance to contain the new wave of COVID-19 spread after the re-opening work and social activities. CONCLUSIONS: Our model is an effective tool useful to investigate different scenarios and to inform policy makers about the potential impact of different control strategies.

The aim of this survey was to explore radiologists' opinions concerning their role and identity in 2020. METHODS: The survey included 124 questions on training, daily work, interaction with colleagues and patients, involvement in teaching, research and management and task delegation. An initial draft was amended following responses from the Presidents of the 48 ESR's national institutional member societies. The final on-line survey was available to individual ESR full members between January and March 2020. 1344 responses from radiologists in 49 European countries were obtained. FINDINGS: 80% (1049/1317) of radiologists considered a period of non-radiology clinical training mandatory and 92% (1192/1291) felt that sub-specialty expertise was important and improved the visibility of radiologists. 76% (961/1262) of radiologists regularly communicate directly with patients. Only 25% (314/1238) had undergone formal communications training although 82% (1020/1238) felt that this would be beneficial. Radiologists highly value their positive interaction with colleagues, including within multi-disciplinary team meetings, despite limited resources. Difficulties identified included high workload, especially the need to cover general work in parallel with the need to offer subspecialty expertise. 66% (837/1262) felt that lack of visibility to patients is a risk to radiology and professional visibility could be improved by radiology-led research and teaching. CONCLUSIONS: ESR activities should aim to (1) support radiologists with sub-specialty training and maintenance of competencies; (2) develop recommendations for patient communications training and multi-disciplinary working with strong clinical integration; (3) enhance radiologists' visibility by harnessing opportunities for radiology-led research and education.",2020,,Insights Imaging,,#1006130,,,,,227251601.0

This species is endemic to Brazil and is currently critically endangered due to its habitat destruction. The genetic basis underlying adaptive traits of New World monkeys has been a subject of interest to several investigators, with significant concern about genes related to the immune system. In the absence of a reference genome, RNA-seq and de novo transcriptome assembly have proved to be valuable genetic procedures for accessing gene sequences and testing evolutionary hypotheses. We present here a first report on the sequencing, assembly, annotation and adaptive selection analysis for thousands of transcripts of B. arachnoides from two different samples, corresponding to 13 different blood cells and fibroblasts. We assembled 284,283 transcripts with N50 of 2,940 bp, with a high rate of complete transcripts, with a median high scoring pair coverage of 88.2%, including low expressed transcripts, accounting for 72.3% of complete BUSCOs. We could predict and extract 81,400 coding sequences with 79.8% of significant BLAST hit against the Euarchontoglires SwissProt dataset. Of these 64,929 sequences, 34,084 were considered homologous to Supraprimate proteins, and of the remaining sequences (30,845), 94% were associated with a protein domain or a KEGG Orthology group, indicating potentially novel or specific protein-coding genes of B. arachnoides. We use the predicted protein sequences to perform a comparative analysis with 10 other primates. This analysis revealed, for the first time in an Atelid species, an expansion of APOBEC3G, extending this knowledge to all NWM families. Using a branch-site model, we searched for evidence of positive selection in 4,533 orthologous sets. This evolutionary analysis revealed 132 amino acid sites in 30 genes potentially evolving under positive selection, shedding light on primate genome evolution. These genes belonged to a wide variety of categories, including those encoding the innate immune system proteins (APOBEC3G, OAS2, and CEACAM1) among others related to the immune response. This work generated a set of thousands of complete sequences that can be used in other studies on molecular evolution and may help to unveil the evolution of primate genes.

Both silencing and upregulation of VDAC1 in various type of cancer cell lines can stimulate apoptosis. In contrast, in mouse embryonic stem (MES) cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), the roles of VDAC1 knockout (VDAC1-/-) in apoptotic cell death are contradictory. The contribution and underlying mechanism of VDAC1-/- in oxidative stress-induced cell death in cardiac cells has not been established. We hypothesized that VDAC1 is an essential regulator of oxidative stress-induced cell death in H9c2 cells. METHODS We knocked out VDAC1 in this rat cardiomyoblast cell line with CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique to produce VDAC1-/- H9c2 cells, and determined if VDAC1 is critical in promoting cell death via oxidative stress induced by tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBHP), an organic peroxide, or rotenone (ROT), an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I by measuring cell viability with MTT assay, cell death with TUNEL stain and LDH release. The mitochondrial and glycolytic stress were examined by measuring O2 consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) with a Seahorse XFp analyzer. RESULTS We found that under control conditions, VDAC1-/- did not affect H9c2 cell proliferation or mitochondrial respiration. However, compared to the wildtype (WT) cells, exposure to either tBHP or ROT enhanced the production of ROS, ECAR, and the proton (H+) production rate (PPR) from glycolysis, as well as promoted apoptotic cell death in VDAC1-/- H9c2 cells. VDAC1-/- H9c2 cells also exhibited markedly reduced mitochondria-bound hexokinase II (HKII) and Bax. Restoration of VDAC1 in VDAC1-/- H9c2 cells reinstated mitochondria-bound HKII and concomitantly decreased tBHP and ROT-induced ROS production and cell death. Interestingly, mitochondrial respiration remained the same after tBHP treatment in VDAC1-/- and WT H9c2 cells. CONCLUSION Our results suggest that VDAC1-/- in H9c2 cells enhances oxidative stress-mediated cell apoptosis that is directly linked to the reduction of mitochondria-bound HKII and concomitantly associated with enhanced ROS production, ECAR, and PPR.",2020-09-09,"Yang, Meiying; Sun, Jie; Stowe, David F; Tajkhorshid, Emad; Kwok, Wai-Meng; Camara, Amadou K S","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",,,,,,https://doi.org/10.33594/000000274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901466/,221571352.0

We previously isolated and characterized SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-like viruses from human and animals, respectively, suggesting that SARS could be transmitted from wild/farmed animals to humans. Comparison of the viral genomes indicated that sequence variation between animal and human isolates existed mainly in the spike (S) gene. We hypothesized that these variations may underlie a change of binding specificity of the S protein to the host cells, permitting viral transmission from animals to humans. Here we report that four 20-mer synthetic peptides (S protein fragments), designed to span these sequence variation hotspots, exhibited significant antiviral activities in a cell line. SARS-CoV infectivity was reduced over 10 000-fold through pre-incubation with two of these peptides, while it was completely inhibited in the presence of three peptides. Molecular modelling of the SARS-CoV peplomer suggests that three of these antiviral peptides map to the interfaces between the three monomers of the trimeric peplomer rather than the heptad repeat region from which short peptides are known to inhibit viral entry.

Cell infection begins when the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds with the cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Here, we address the role of Tetracycline as an inhibitor for the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Targeted molecular investigation show that Tetracycline binds more favorably to the RBD (-9.40 kcal/mol) compared to Chloroquine (-6.31 kcal/mol) or Doxycycline (-8.08 kcal/mol) and inhibits attachment to ACE2 to a greater degree (binding efficiency of 2.98 $\frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{nm}^2}$ for Tetracycline-RBD, 5.59 $\frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{nm}^2}$ for Chloroquine-RBD, 5.16 $\frac{\text{kcal}}{\text{mol}\cdot \text{nm}^2}$ for Doxycycline-RBD). Stronger Tetracycline inhibition is verified with nonequilibrium PMF calculations, for which the Tetracycline-RBD complex exhibits the lowest free energy profile along the dissociation pathway from ACE2. Tetracycline appears to target viral residues that are usually involved in significant hydrogen bonding with ACE2; this inhibition of cellular infection complements the anti-inflammatory and cytokine suppressing capability of Tetracycline, and may further reduce the duration of ICU stays and mechanical ventilation induced by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.",2020-08-13,"Zhao, Tom Y.; Patankar, Neelesh A.",,,,2008.06034,document_parses/pdf_json/f222e7a05c6ff4c861e032736e7c6077ac4f05ec.json,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06034v1.pdf,221112278.0

Especially challenging in places with sparse healthcare, limited diagnostic capacity, and public health infrastructure, syndromes with overlapping febrile presentations easily evade early detection. There is a clear need for evidence-based and context-dependent tools to make syndromic surveillance more efficient. Using published data on symptom presentation and incidence of 21 febrile syndromes, we develop a novel algorithm for aetiological identification of case clusters and demonstrate its ability to identify outbreaks of dengue, malaria, typhoid fever, and meningococcal disease based on clinical data from past outbreaks. We then apply the same algorithm to simulated outbreaks to systematically estimate the syndromic detectability of outbreaks of all 21 syndromes. We show that while most rare haemorrhagic fevers are clinically distinct from most endemic fevers in sub-Saharan Africa, VHF detectability is limited even under conditions of perfect syndromic surveillance. Furthermore, even large clusters (20+ cases) of filoviral diseases cannot be routinely distinguished by the clinical criteria present in their case definitions alone; we show that simple syndromic case definitions are insensitive to rare fevers across most of the region. We map the estimated detectability of Ebola virus disease across sub-Saharan Africa, based on geospatially mapped estimates of malaria, dengue, and other fevers with overlapping syndromes. We demonstrate ""hidden hotspots"" where Ebola virus is likely to spill over from wildlife and also transmit undetected for many cases. Such places may represent both the locations of past unobserved outbreaks and potential future origins for larger epidemics.

DATA SOURCES EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane and MEDLINE databases were searched from 1980 to April 2019. International trial registries and reference lists of included studies completed our search. REVIEW METHODS Randomized controlled trials that involved interventions aiming to change the practice of clinicians working in stroke rehabilitation were included. Bias was evaluated using RevMan to generate a risk of bias table. Evidence quality was evaluated using GRADE criteria. RESULTS A total of 16 trials were included (250 sites, 14,689 patients), evaluating a range of interventions including facilitation, audit and feedback, education and reminders. Of which, 11 studies included multicomponent interventions (using a combination of interventions). Four used educational interventions alone, and one used electronic reminders. Risk of bias was generally low. Overall, the GRADE criteria indicated that this body of literature was of low quality. This review found higher efficacy of trials which targeted fewer outcomes. Subgroup analysis indicated moderate-level GRADE evidence (103 sites, 10,877 patients) that trials which included both site facilitation and tailoring for local factors were effective in changing clinical practice. The effect size of these varied (odds ratio: 1.63-4.9). Education interventions alone were not effective. CONCLUSION A large range of interventions are used to facilitate clinical practice change. Education is commonly used, but in isolation is not effective.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers an evidence-based behavioral weight management intervention called MOVE!, mostly delivered through in-person group sessions. Few eligible Veterans participate due to factors like distance and preferences, mirroring barriers in the general population. Practical alternatives to standard in-person programs are needed to improve access and engagement. A self-directed lifestyle intervention called D-ELITE—delivered through pre-recorded videos by DVD or online streaming—previously efficacious in a general primary care population, may provide such an alternative. This pragmatic clinical trial will evaluate whether D-ELITE improves weight and general health status among Veterans with obesity, relative to VA usual care. The yearlong intervention includes one orientation by phone, supplemental lifestyle coaching primarily via technology-based messages, 12 DVD or online streaming sessions over 3 months, and continued self-directed weight management for months 4–12. Participants use MyFitnessPal.com or paper booklets for self-monitoring weight, diet, and physical activity. Follow-up assessments at 12 and 24 months are administered by mail or phone. The study hypothesis is that compared with usual care, D-ELITE will lead to greater improvements in 12-month weight loss, per VA electronic health records, and general physical health status, assessed using the self-reported SF-12 physical composite score. We will also explore D-ELITE's effects on secondary biometric (e.g., HbA1c) and intermediate (e.g., diet) outcomes, reach, and budget impact.

The present study measured the emotional state of university students during lockdown and identified the relevant situational and psychological factors. To this end, 1,297 French university students were assessed during lockdown, which lasted from 16 March to 11 May in France. Situational factors included the belief that lockdown was compromising their future job prospects, COVID-19 symptoms, and health concerns. Psychological factors included students' implicit theory of emotion, and the coping strategies they used during lockdown. We explored the extent to which these factors were associated with levels of hassles, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Results indicated that students' belief that lockdown was compromising their future job prospects was positively related to hassles (r = .34, p < .001), while concerns about their own health and that of relatives were positively associated with anxiety (r = .37 and .34; p < .001). In addition, use of the positive reframing coping strategy mediated the effect of students' implicit theory of emotion on their depressive symptoms.

Data was sought on participants’ characteristics, knowledge on equipment preparation and management of en route adverse events. Four clinical IFT scenarios were set for participants and answers were scored. Measured outcomes were defined as (1) relationships between clinical experience and relevant training in IFT with questionnaire results, (2) staff knowledge of the equipment carried routinely in ambulances and (3) the en route adverse events encountered according to the participants’ past experience. RESULTS: Participants’ test scores ranged from 24 to 37 (out of 40) with a mean of 30.6 (95% confidence interval 29.7–31.5).

Thus, we hypothesized that additional ORFs are present in the PRRSV genome that may contribute to its biological properties, and so we screened highly purified virions of strain VR2332, the prototype type 2 PRRSV, for evidence of novel polypeptides. A 51 aa polypeptide was discovered that is encoded by an alternative ORF of the subgenomic mRNA encoding the major envelope glycoprotein, GP5, and which is incorporated into virions. The protein, referred to as ORF5a protein, is expressed in infected cells, and pigs infected with PRRSV express anti-ORF5a protein antibodies.

A clear description of local RSV molecular epidemiology, evolution, and transmission requires detailed sequence data and can inform new strategies for virus control and vaccine development. We have generated 27 complete or nearly complete genomes of RSV from hospitalized children attending a rural coastal district hospital in Kilifi, Kenya, over a 10-year period using a novel full-genome deep-sequencing process. Phylogenetic analysis of the new genomes demonstrated the existence and cocirculation of multiple genotypes in both RSV A and B groups in Kilifi. Comparison of local versus global strains demonstrated that most RSV A variants observed locally in Kilifi were also seen in other parts of the world, while the Kilifi RSV B genomes encoded a high degree of variation that was not observed in other parts of the world. The nucleotide substitution rates for the individual open reading frames (ORFs) were highest in the regions encoding the attachment (G) glycoprotein and the NS2 protein.

Although RNA synthesis and virus assembly occur in the cytoplasm, HRSV is known to induce nuclear responses in the host cell as replication alters global gene expression. Quantitative proteomics was used to take an unbiased overview of the protein changes in transformed human alveolar basal epithelial cells infected with HRSV. Underpinning this was the use of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to LC-MS/MS, which allowed the direct and simultaneous identification and quantification of both cellular and viral proteins. To reduce sample complexity and increase data return on potential protein localization, cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. This resulted in the identification of 1,140 cellular proteins and six viral proteins. The proteomics data were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis to identify defined canonical pathways and functional groupings. Selected data were validated using Western blot, direct and indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, and functional assays. The study served to validate and expand upon known HRSV-host cell interactions, including those associated with the antiviral response and alterations in subnuclear structures such as the nucleolus and ND10 (promyelocytic leukemia bodies). In addition, novel changes were observed in mitochondrial proteins and functions, cell cycle regulatory molecules, nuclear pore complex proteins and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking proteins. These data shed light into how the cell is potentially altered to create conditions more favorable for infection.

Especially if common marmosets are used as experimental animals in respiratory research, detailed knowledge on the spectrum, occurrence, and incidence of spontaneous histopathological pulmonary lesions in this non-human primate species is required. In this study, lung tissue of 638 common marmosets from the marmoset colony of the German Primate Center was examined histologically. The analysis revealed a high incidence of predominantly mild and multifocal interstitial pneumonia (32.99 %) of unknown etiology in most cases. Only few marmosets exhibited lobar pneumonia (1.41 %) and bronchopneumonia (0.94), which were mainly caused by bacterial pathogens such as Bordetella bronchiseptica and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Lung immaturity and atelectasis were common histological findings in newborn marmosets. Typical background lesions included anthracosis (8.15 %), hemosiderosis (1.72 %), extramedullary hematopoiesis (11.6 %), mineralization (10.97 %), and inflammatory cell foci (10.34 %).

Despite the clinical importance of feline retroviruses and the growing interest in cats as pets, information about FeLV and FIV in Malaysia is presently insufficient to properly advise veterinarians and pet owners. A cross-sectional study was carried out from January 2010 to December 2010 to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with FeLV and FIV among domestic cats in peninsular Malaysia. Plasma samples were harvested from the blood of 368 domestic cats and screened for evidence of FeLV p27 antigen and FIV antibodies, using an immunochromatographic kit. Additionally, data on cat demographics and health were collected using a structured questionnaire, and were evaluated as potential risk factors for FeLV or FIV status. RESULTS: Of the 368 cats that were evaluated in this study, 12.2% (45/368; 95% CI = 8.88 - 15.58) were positive for FeLV p27 antigen, 31.3%, (115/368; 95% CI = 26.51 - 35.99) were seropositive to FIV antibodies, and 4.3% (16/368; 95% CI = 2.27 - 6.43) had evidence of both viruses. Factors found to significantly increase the risk for FeLV seropositivity include sex, age, behaviour, sickness, and living in a multi-cat household. Seropositive response to FIV was significantly associated with sex, neuter status, age, behaviour, and health status. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that FeLV and FIV are common among domestic cats in peninsular Malaysia, and that factors related to cat demographics and health such as age, sex, behaviour, health status and type of household are important predictors for seropositive status to FeLV or FIV in peninsular Malaysia. High prevalence of FeLV or FIV observed in our study is of concern, in view of the immunosuppressive potentials of the two pathogens.

However, there was no significant difference in the detection of BoV in cases and controls. This review supports RSV, Flu, PIV, HMPV, AdV, RV, and CoV as important causes of ARI in older adults and provides quantitative estimates of the absolute proportion of virus-associated ARI cases to which a viral cause can be attributed.

The changes in the immune system that accompany human aging are very complex and are generally referred to as immunosenescence. The factors and mechanisms of immunosenescence are multiple and include, among others, defects in the bone marrow, thymic involution, and intrinsic defects in the formation, maturation, homeostasis, and migration of peripheral lymphocytes. Aging affects both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. The process of aging is commonly accompanied by low-grade inflammation thought to contribute to neuroinflammation and to many age-related diseases. Numerous attempts to define the role of chronic inflammation in aging have implicated chronic oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, immunosenescence, epigenetic modifications, and other phenomena. Several lifestyle strategies, such as intervening to provide an adequate diet and physical and mental activity, have been shown to result in improved immune and neuroprotective functions, a decrease in oxidative stress and inflammation, and a potential increase in individual longevity. The studies published thus far describe a critical role for nutrition in maintaining the immune response of the aged, but they also indicate the need for a more in-depth, holistic approach to determining the optimal nutritional and behavioral strategies that would maintain immune and other physiological systems in elderly people. In this chapter, we focus first on the age-related changes of the immune system. Further, we discuss possible deleterious influences of immunosenescence and low-grade inflammation (inflammaging) on neurodegenerative processes in the normally aging brain.

However, to our knowledge, there are no reports to date of the utilization or results of repeat testing to help guide this practice. METHODS: The authors searched the institutional laboratory information system for consecutive patients who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR of a nasopharyngeal specimen over a 1-month period. Characteristics and results of patients who received a single or multiple tests were documented and analyzed. RESULTS: Six thousand three (6003) tests were performed on 5757 patients; 272 (4.7%) patients were positive based on their initial test results. Two hundred thirty-six (4%) patients were tested more than once, with 226 (96%) tested twice. The largest proportion of these patients (n=160, 71%) were those who had an initial negative test followed by a repeat test for persistent symptoms. This group included all 7 patients who had discordant positive results on their second test; the result concordance rate within this group was 96%. CONCLUSION: In a population of patients with a low positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 by nasopharyngeal RT-PCR testing, repeat nasopharyngeal testing of negative patients who have persistent symptoms still yields a negative result in 96% of the cases.",2020,"Kovacs, S Krisztian; Palmer, Jill; Chen, Derrick J; Rehrauer, William; Yang, David T",WMJ,,#887855,,,,,225053654.0

Pseudomonas was the most common bacteria grown in 31 (29.8%) followed by Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) in three (2.8%) patients. Among viruses, Rhinovirus was the most common, identified in 16 (17.4%) samples followed by coronavirus in four (4.3%). Fungi and mycobacteria were isolated from 23 (22.1%) and four (3.8%) children, respectively. Aspergillus flavus was the most common fungus isolated in 13 (12.5%) children. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Pseudomonas was the most common organism isolated during exacerbation. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were not isolated, whereas infection with Bcc and Mycobacterium tuberculosis was observed, which could probably have a role in CF morbidity. Polymicrobial infections were associated with severe exacerbations.",2020-01-31,"Arvind, Balaji; Medigeshi, Guruprasad R.; Kapil, Arti; Xess, Immaculata; Singh, Urvashi; Lodha, Rakesh; Kabra, Sushil Kumar",Indian J Med Res,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7055172.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.4103/ijmr.ijmr_1275_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32134016/,211828728.0

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the reproduction number of COVID-19 swarmed in the scientific community and public media due to its simplicity in explaining an infectious disease dynamic. This paper aims to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 over time in Bangladesh and its districts using reported cases. Methods Adapted methods derived from Bettencourt and Ribeiro (2008), which is a sequential Bayesian approach using the compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, have been used to estimate Rt. Findings As of July 21, the mean Rt is 1.32(0.98-1.70, 90% HDI), with a median of 1.16(0.99-1.34 90% HDI). The initial Rt of Bangladesh was 3, whereas the Rt on the day of imposing nation-wide lockdown was 1.47, at the end of lockdown phase 1 was 1.06, at the end of lockdown phase 2 was 1.33. Each phase of nation-wide lockdown has contributed to the decline of effective reproduction number (Rt) for Bangladesh by 28.44%, and 26.70%, respectively, implying moderate effectiveness of the epidemic response strategies. Interpretation and Conclusion The mean Rt fell by 13.55% from May 31 to July 21, 2020, despite easing of lockdown in Bangladesh. The Rt continued to fall below the threshold value one steadily from the beginning of July and sustained around 1. The mean Rt fell by 13.55% from May 31 to July 21, 2020, despite easing of lockdown in Bangladesh. As of July 21, the current estimate of Rt is 1.07(0.92-1.15: 90% HDI), meaning that an infected individual is spreading the virus to an average of one other, with 0.07 added chance of infecting a second individual. This whole research recommends two things- broader testing and careful calibration of measures to keep Rt a long way below the crucial threshold one.",2020-08-06,"Hridoy, A.-E.

159571,7dge6emf,,WHO,Coronavirus: COVID-19 Transmission in Pacific Small Island Developing States,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS) have health care systems with a limited capacity to deal with pandemics, making them especially vulnerable to the economic and social impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19). This paper examines the introduction, transmission, and incidence of COVID-19 into Pacific SIDS. METHODS: Calculate the rate of transmission (the average number of new cases per day between the first recorded case and the most recent day) and connectivity (daily direct flights to the leading airport in each selected island group) using flight history and COVID-19 transmission data. RESULTS: Correlational analyses show that connectivity is positively related with (a) first-case dates and (b) spread rate in Pacific SIDS. CONCLUSION: Connectivity plays a central role in the spread of COVID-19 in Pacific SIDS. The continued entry of people was a significant factor for spread within countries. Efforts to prevent transmission by closing borders reduced transmission but also created significant economic hardship because many Pacific SIDS rely heavily on tourism and international exchange. The findings highlight the importance of exploring the possibility that the COVID-19 spread rate may be higher than official figures indicate, and present pathways to mitigate socio-economic impacts. The practical implications of the findings reveal the vulnerability of Pacific SIDS to pandemics and the key role of connectivity in the spread of COVID-19 in the Pacific region.",2020,"Leal Filho, Walter; Lütz, Johannes M; Sattler, David N; Nunn, Patrick D",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,#680169,,,,,220892501.0

However, the actual number of infections in people who have had contact with camels is unknown and most index patients cannot recall any such contact. We aimed to do a nationwide serosurvey in Saudi Arabia to establish the prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies, both in the general population and in populations of individuals who have maximum exposure to camels. METHODS: In the cross-sectional serosurvey, we tested human serum samples obtained from healthy individuals older than 15 years who attended primary health-care centres or participated in a national burden-of-disease study in all 13 provinces of Saudi Arabia. Additionally, we tested serum samples from shepherds and abattoir workers with occupational exposure to camels. Samples were screened by recombinant ELISA and MERS-CoV seropositivity was confirmed by recombinant immunofluorescence and plaque reduction neutralisation tests. We used two-tailed Mann Whitney U exact tests, χ(2), and Fisher's exact tests to analyse the data. FINDINGS: Between Dec 1, 2012, and Dec 1, 2013, we obtained individual serum samples from 10 009 individuals. Anti-MERS-CoV antibodies were confirmed in 15 (0·15%; 95% CI 0·09–0·24) of 10 009 people in six of the 13 provinces. The mean age of seropositive individuals was significantly younger than that of patients with reported, laboratory-confirmed, primary Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (43·5 years [SD 17·3] vs 53·8 years [17·5]; p=0·008). Men had a higher antibody prevalence than did women (11 [0·25%] of 4341 vs two [0·05%] of 4378; p=0·028) and antibody prevalence was significantly higher in central versus coastal provinces (14 [0·26%] of 5479 vs one [0·02%] of 4529; p=0·003). Compared with the general population, seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly increased by 15 times in shepherds (two [2·3%] of 87, p=0·0004) and by 23 times in slaughterhouse workers (five [3·6%] of 140; p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies was significantly higher in camel-exposed individuals than in the general population. By simple multiplication, a projected 44 951 (95% CI 26 971–71 922) individuals older than 15 years might be seropositive for MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. These individuals might be the source of infection for patients with confirmed MERS who had no previous exposure to camels.

The polymerization is initiated by primary amine initiators using N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) as solvent. Carrying out the reaction in a silicon microflow reactor speeds up the rate of ROP (92% conversion in 40 min in flow as opposed to 6 h in batch) due to highly efficient permeation of CO2 through the reactor tubing.

Research grant providers such as the European Union increasingly require open access publishing of research results and data. However, despite its significance to research, the adoption rate of open data technology remains low across all disciplines, especially in Europe where research has primarily focused on technical solutions (such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework) or considered only parts of the issue. METHODS AND FINDINGS In this study, we emphasized the non-technical factors perceived value and uncertainty factors in the context of academia, which impact researchers' acceptance of open data-the idea that researchers should not only publish their findings in the form of articles or reports, but also share the corresponding raw data sets. We present the results of a broad quantitative analysis including N = 995 researchers from 13 large to medium-sized universities in Germany. In order to test 11 hypotheses regarding researchers' intentions to share their data, as well as detect any hierarchical or disciplinary differences, we employed a structured equation model (SEM) following the partial least squares (PLS) modeling approach. CONCLUSIONS Grounded in the value-based theory, this article proclaims that most individuals in academia embrace open data when the perceived advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Furthermore, uncertainty factors impact the perceived value (consisting of the perceived advantages and disadvantages) of sharing research data. We found that researchers' assumptions about effort required during the data preparation process were diminished by awareness of e-science technologies (such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework), which also increased their tendency to perceive personal benefits via data exchange. Uncertainty factors seem to influence the intention to share data.

Airway management has been particularly difficult; the challenge of quickly establishing an airway in patients must be balanced by the risk of aerosolizing respiratory secretions and putting the provider at risk of infection. Significant attention has been given to developing protocols for the emergency department and critical care units, but little guidance regarding establishing airway and respiratory support for patients in the prehospital setting has been made available. While some of the recommendations can be extrapolated from hospital guidelines, other factors such as environment and available resources make these protocols unfeasible.

METHODS Data were obtained from an ecological momentary assessment study of PrEP use and sexual behaviour. Participants were individuals accessing PrEP through the National Health Service (NHS) sexual health clinics across four health boards in Wales. Weekly data documenting condomless sex in the preceding week were analysed between 03/02/2020 and 10/05/2020. The introduction of social distancing measures and changes to sexual health clinics in Wales occurred on the week starting 16/03/2020. Two-level logistic regression models were fitted to condomless sex (yes/no) over time, included an indicator for the week starting 16/03/2020, and were extended to explore differential associations by relationship status and sexual health clinic. RESULTS Data were available from 56 participants and included 697 person-weeks (89% of the maximum number that could have been obtained). On average, 42% of participants reported condomless sex in the period prior to the introduction of social distancing measures and 20% reported condomless sex after (OR=0.16, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.37, p<0.001). There was some evidence to suggest that this association was moderated by relationship status (OR for single participants=0.09, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.23; OR for not single participants=0.46, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.25). CONCLUSIONS The introduction of social distancing measures and changes to PrEP services across Wales was associated with a marked reduction in reported instances of condomless sexual intercourse among respondents, with a larger reduction in those who were single compared with those who were not.
