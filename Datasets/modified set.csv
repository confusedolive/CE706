smq5r6ck,nan,WHO,Learning Active Implementation Frameworks: the role of implementation teams in a case study from Pakistan,nan,nan,nan,unk,"In Pakistan, although coverage of Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health (MNCH) services has increased, the attributable disease burden remains high, indicating quality of these services remains suboptimal. To address this quality gap, challenges associated with the implementation of MNCH services will need to be addressed and effective use of the various MNCH guidelines will need to be supported, evaluated, and continuously improved. Even though the application of the field of implementation science and practice in the low- and middle-income settings has been limited, it is our belief, based on the experience described in this article that these competencies could enhance health professionals' ability to, not only successfully integrate MNCH guidelines into health systems, but to also support their effective and sustainable use. To address this capacity gap in Pakistan, the Health Services Academy, as a member of the World Health Organization's Human Reproduction Program (HRP) Alliance for Research Capacity Strengthening (RCS), has engaged, over the course of 16 months, in the 'Implementation for the Professional Learner Program' in 2019. This innovative implementation science and practice capacity-building program is developed and conducted by The World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre for Research Evidence for Sexual and Reproductive Health at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). The initial cohort of this Program also included Palestine's West Bank, and Egypt. The objectives of this Program were to cultivate implementation science and practice competencies, and to support the development of national, community-based or institution-based implementation teams. The expected outcomes of this program included, further enhancement of the capacity of local health professionals in implementation science, systemic change and the effective use of innovations in practice at sub-national/regional levels.",2020,"Hamid, Saima; Mureed, Sheh; Kayani, Aasia; Javed, Kiran; Khan, Adnan; Awais, Sayema; Khan, Neelam; Tus-Salam, Fakiha; Fixsen, Dean L",Glob Health Action,nan,#731368,nan,nan,nan,nan,221305659.0

METHODS All femoral tunneled catheter insertions from 1996 to 2006 were reviewed, during which time 123 catheters were inserted. Of these, 66 were exchanges. Patients with femoral catheter failure versus those with femoral catheter patency were compared. Confounding factors, such as demographic and procedural factors, were incorporated and assessed using univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. RESULTS Mean catheter primary patency failure time was 96.3 days (SE 17.9 days). Primary patency at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days was 53.8%, 45.4%, 32.1%, and 27.1% respectively. Crude rates of risk of catheter failure did not suggest a benefit for patients receiving catheters introduced from one side versus the other, but more cephalad location of catheter tip was associated with improved patency. Multivariate analysis showed that patients whose catheters were on the left side (p = 0.009), were of increasing age at the time of insertion (p = 0.002) and that those who had diabetes (p = 0.001) were at significantly greater risk of catheter failure.

Nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (Nurr1) is a nuclear hormone receptor implicated in limiting mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and inflammation in the central nervous system and protecting dopaminergic neurons and a promising therapeutic target for PD. Cicadidae Periostracum (CP), the cast-off skin of Cryptotympana pustulata Fabricius, has been used in traditional medicine for its many clinical pharmacological effects, including the treatment of psychological symptoms in PD. However, scientific evidence for the use of CP in neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, is lacking. Here, we investigated the protective effects of CP on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine- (MPTP-) induced PD in mice and explored the underlying mechanisms of action, focusing on Nurr1. CP increased the expression levels of Nurr1, tyrosine hydroxylase, DOPA decarboxylase, dopamine transporter, and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 via extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in differentiated PC12 cells and the mouse SNPC. In MPTP-induced PD, CP promoted recovery from movement impairments. CP prevented dopamine depletion and protected against dopaminergic neuronal degradation via mitochondria-mediated apoptotic proteins such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X, cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3 by inhibiting MPTP-induced neuroinflammatory cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase 2, and glial/microglial activation. Moreover, CP inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammatory cytokines and response levels and glial/microglial activation in BV2 microglia and the mouse brain. Our findings suggest that CP might contribute to neuroprotective signaling by regulating neurotrophic factors primarily via Nurr1 signaling, neuroinflammation, and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.",2019-10-24,"Lim, Hye-Sun; Kim, Joong-Sun; Moon, Byeong Cheol; Choi, Goya; Ryu, Seung Mok; Lee, Jun; Ang, Mary Jasmin; Jeon, Mijin; Moon, Changjong; Park, Gunhyuk",Oxid Med Cell Longev,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/bd6dd93085fa736cac9569090a8cb88324daf18f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6854990.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/5797512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31772707/,208072783.0

Here, we show that RIF1 must be present both during replication stress and in the ensuing recovery period to promote cell survival. Of two isoforms produced by alternative splicing, we find that RIF1-Long alone can protect cells against replication inhibition, but RIF1-Short is incapable of mediating protection. Consistent with this isoform-specific role, RIF1-Long is required to promote the formation of the 53BP1 nuclear bodies that protect unrepaired damage sites in the G1 phase following replication stress. Overall, our observations show that RIF1 is needed at several cell cycle stages after replication insult, with the RIF1-Long isoform playing a specific role during the ensuing G1 phase in damage site protection.",2020,"Watts, Lotte P; Natsume, Toyoaki; Saito, Yuichiro; Garzon, Javier; Dong, Qianqian; Boteva, Lora; Gilbert, Nick; Kanemaki, Masato T; Hiraga, Shin-Ichiro; Donaldson, Anne D",eLife (Cambridge),nan,#33141022,nan,nan,nan,nan,214043025.0

We report a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus RdRp mutant strain with a mutator phenotype. Based on structural data of RdRp, rational targeting of key residues, and screening of fidelity variants, we isolated a novel low-fidelity mutator strain of influenza virus that harbors a Tyr82-to-Cys (Y82C) single amino acid substitution in the PB1 polymerase subunit. The purified PB1-Y82C polymerase indeed showed an increased frequency of misincorporation compared with the wild-type PB1 in an in vitro biochemical assay. To further investigate the effects of position 82 on PB1 polymerase fidelity, we substituted various amino acids at this position. As a result, we isolated various novel mutators other than PB1-Y82C with higher mutation frequencies. The structural model of influenza virus polymerase complex suggested that the Tyr82 residue, which is located at the nucleoside triphosphate entrance tunnel, may influence a fidelity checkpoint. Interestingly, although the PB1-Y82C variant replicated with wild-type PB1-like kinetics in tissue culture, the 50% lethal dose of the PB1-Y82C mutant was 10 times lower than that of wild-type PB1 in embryonated chicken eggs. In conclusion, our data indicate that the Tyr82 residue of PB1 has a crucial role in regulating polymerase fidelity of influenza virus and is closely related to attenuated pathogenic phenotypes in vivo ImportanceInfluenza A virus rapidly acquires antigenic changes and antiviral drug resistance, which limit the effectiveness of vaccines and drug treatments, primarily owing to its high rate of evolution. Virus populations formed by quasispecies can contain resistance mutations even before a selective pressure is applied. To study the effects of the viral mutation spectrum and quasispecies, high- and low-fidelity variants have been isolated for several RNA viruses. Here, we report the discovery of a low-fidelity RdRp variant of influenza A virus that contains a substitution at Tyr82 in PB1. Viruses containing the PB1-Y82C substitution showed growth kinetics and viral RNA synthesis levels similar to those of the wild-type virus in cell culture; however, they had significantly attenuated phenotypes in a chicken egg infection experiment. These data demonstrated that a decreased RdRp fidelity attenuates influenza A virus in vivo, which is a desirable feature for the development of safer live-attenuated vaccine candidates.",2019,"Naito, Tadasuke; Shirai, Kazumasa; Mori, Kotaro; Muratsu, Hidetaka; Ushirogawa, Hiroshi; Ohniwa, Ryosuke L; Hanada, Kousuke; Saito, Mineki",Journal of virology,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00834-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462570/,201669623.0

Resistance training (RT) has been repeatedly shown to improve muscle function (e.g. strength) and functional capacity (e.g. gait speed, chair-rise) in older adults with functional limitations. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether such objectively assessed improvements translate into a reduction in self-reported disability. Objectives To assess: i) whether and to what extent RT interventions have an effect on self-reported disability in older adults (≥65 years) with functional limitations or disability; and ii) whether the effects on self-reported disability are associated with changes in objective measures of muscle strength and functional capacity across studies. Methods PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus electronic databases were searched in June 2018. Randomized controlled trials reporting effects of RT on self-reported disability/function in ≥65 year-old adults with defined, functional limitations or self-reported disability were eligible. Data on self-reported disability/function were pooled by calculating adjusted standardized mean differences (SMD) using Hedges'g. Likewise, effect sizes for three secondary outcomes: knee extensor muscle strength; gait capacity; and lower body functional capacity were calculated and fit as covariates in separate meta-regressions with self-reported disability as the dependent factor. Results Fourteen RCTs were eligible for the primary meta-analysis on self-reported disability. The total number of participants was 651 (intervention n = 354; control n = 297). A significant moderate positive effect of RT was found (SMD: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.253 to 0.925, p = 0.001). Between-study heterogeneity was present (I2 statistic = 75,1%, p < 0.001). RT effects on objective measures of lower body functional capacity were significantly associated with effects on self-reported disability (Adj. R2 = 99%, p = 0.002, n = 12 studies), whereas no significant associations with gait capacity or knee extensor strength were found.

In addition, we aimed to identify drugs that could be repurposed to inhibit GRP78, thus with potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Gene expression studies were performed in 10 SARS-CoV-2 (−) and 24 SARS-CoV-2 (+) pneumonia patients. A structure-based virtual screen was performed with 10,761 small molecules retrieved from DrugBank, using the GRP78 nucleotide binding domain and substrate binding domain as molecular targets. Results indicated that GRP78 mRNA levels were approximately four times higher in the blood of SARS-CoV-2 (+) versus SARS-CoV-2 (−) pneumonia patients, further suggesting that GRP78 might be a good molecular target to treat Covid-19. In addition, a total of 409 compounds were identified with potential as GRP78 inhibitors. In conclusion, we found preliminary evidence that further proposes GRP78 as a possible molecular target to treat Covid-19 and that many clinically approved drugs bind GRP78 as an off-target effect.

The pandemic offers a natural experiment wherein the policy problem governments faced was the same but the responses they made were different, creating opportunities for comparison of both the kinds of policy tools being used and the factors that accounted for their choice. Accordingly, after surveying on-line databases of policy tools used in the pandemic and subjecting these to topic modelling to reveal the characteristics of a ‘standard’ national pandemic response, we discuss the similarities and differences found in specific responses. This is done with reference to the nature and level of policy capacity of respective governments, highlighting the critical roles played by (in)adequate preparation and lesson-drawing from past experiences with similar outbreaks or crises. Taken together the articles show how the national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic were shaped by the opportunity and capacity each government had to learn from previous pandemics and their capacity to operationalize and build political support for the standard portfolio of policy measures deployed to deal with the crisis.

However, subunit vaccines have not been successfully commercialized mainly due to the lack of sufficient levels of neutralizing antibodies (NAs). High levels of NA rely on the efficient recognition and cross-linking of multiple neutralizing epitopes with B-cell receptors (BCRs). Nanoparticles are able to display coupled antigenic arrays at high density and provide multiple binding molecular scenarios with BCRs. The high-resolution antigenic structure makes it possible to accurately display stable neutralizing epitopes. Therefore, the development of a nanovaccine that orientationally displays neutralizing epitopes is a feasible strategy. To address this hypothesis, the capsid (Cap) protein of porcine circovirus type 2 as model antigen was conjugated to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) through direct reaction of the mercapto group of the unique cysteines with AuNPs, rendering Cap-AuNPs to have neutralizing epitopes on outer surface and an immunodominant epitope buried within the inner surface. In vitro studies showed that AuNPs promoted the phagocytosis of Cap protein and NA levels were significantly improved, meanwhile antibody levels against the immunodominant epitope was significantly reduced. In mouse studies, Cap-AuNP-immunized mice displayed a high production of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, and interferon-γ, suggesting that Cap-AuNPs can effectively activate CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and balance Th1 and Th2 cellular responses. This study presents a new vaccine design strategy based on antigen structure, where nanoparticles are coupled to antigens in well-ordered arrays and orientationally display neutralizing epitopes to enhance NA levels.",2017-07-24,"Ding, Peiyang; Zhang, Teng; Li, Yafei; Teng, Man; Sun, Yaning; Liu, Xiao; Chai, Shujun; Zhou, Enmin; Jin, Qianyue; Zhang, Gaiping",Int J Nanomedicine,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/b7bf3bca72a759d1b1c4b003ce431ee58d0dbe27.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5533572.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijn.s140789; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28769561/,3413438.0

METHODS During the COVID-19 epidemic, the medical staff divided the patients visiting the emergency department into suspected group, fever group and control group through interview of the patients at triage. Self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) were distributed to each patient, and a trained medical staff was responsible for assisting the patient to complete the scales. RESULTS A total of 557 sets of scales were distributed, including 211 in suspected COVID-19 case group, 167 in fever group and 179 in the control group. A total of 516 scales were retrieved, including 197 in suspected case group, 151 in fever group and 168 in control group.

However, social distancing has negative consequences, including increases in depression and anxiety. Digital interventions, such as text messaging, can provide accessible support on a population-wide scale. We developed text messages in English and Spanish to help individuals manage their depressive mood and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial, we aim to examine the effect of our 60-day text messaging intervention. Additionally, we aim to assess whether the use of machine learning to adapt the messaging frequency and content improves the effectiveness of the intervention. Finally, we will examine the differences in daily mood ratings between the message categories and time windows. METHODS: The messages were designed within two different categories: behavioral activation and coping skills. Participants will be randomized into (1) a random messaging arm, where message category and timing will be chosen with equal probabilities, and (2) a reinforcement learning arm, with a learned decision mechanism for choosing the messages. Participants in both arms will receive one message per day within three different time windows and will be asked to provide their mood rating 3 hours later. We will compare self-reported daily mood ratings; self-reported depression, using the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire; and self-reported anxiety, using the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale at baseline and at intervention completion. RESULTS: The Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the University of California Berkeley approved this study in April 2020 (No. 2020-04-13162). Data collection began in April 2020 and will run to April 2021. As of August 24, 2020, we have enrolled 229 participants. We plan to submit manuscripts describing the main results of the trial and results from the microrandomized trial for publication in peer-reviewed journals and for presentations at national and international scientific meetings. CONCLUSIONS: Results will contribute to our knowledge of effective psychological tools to alleviate the negative effects of social distancing and the benefit of using machine learning to personalize digital mental health interventions.

The genetic change of this virus in specific populations over time is of great interest to understand the evolution and epidemiology of viruses. To facilitate the collections of HRV sequences over a number of years, a virology experiment was designed in which students test nasal lavage samples to look for HRV infection. Students will learn a variety of techniques including RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, qPCR, and agarose gel electrophoresis as well as bioinformatic skills though examination of sequences from the HRV‐field isolates. Furthermore, students can look at symptom data from subjects to investigate correlations between symptom severity and factors such as stress and sleep patterns. Such information can be used to examine hypotheses regarding HRV mutation, symptom severity and epidemiology.

Cattle are the most common mammalian species in which Cryptosporidium is detected, with pre-weaned calves considered to be reservoirs for zoonotic C. parvum. In October 2013, severe diarrhoea was observed in 396 pre-weaned calves at a farm in the Ningxia Autonomous Region of Northwestern China. 356 of the infected calves died despite antibiotic therapy. FINDINGS: 252 faecal samples were collected from the investigated farm. The identity of Cryptosporidium species was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis, and by DNA sequence analysis of the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene. C. parvum was subtyped using sequence analysis of the 60 kDa glycoprotein (gp60) gene. The highest infection rate of 83.3% (40/48) was seen in 2–3-week-old calves with diarrhoea, corresponding to the age at which animals died.

DATA SOURCES: Coronavirus disease ICU, Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden. STUDY SELECTION: Case report. DATA EXTRACTION: Radiology, intracranial pressure, intracranial compliance (correlation between intracranial pressure amplitude and mean intracranial pressure), cerebral vasomotor reactivity (pressure reactivity index), arterial blood pressure, cerebrospinal fluid chemistry, and treatment. DATA SYNTHESIS: None. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of intracranial pressure monitoring in a patient with acute encephalitis following coronavirus disease 2019. Intracranial pressure data exhibited a high incidence of plateau waves with intracranial pressure insults above 40 mm Hg that required cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Intracranial compliance was low, and pressure reactivity was intact.

To fill in this gap, we characterized COVID-19 patients at the time at which they were diagnosed in outpatient settings and estimated 30-day hospital admission and fatality rates. METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study. : Data were obtained from Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP)-a primary-care records database covering >6 million people (>80% of the population of Catalonia), linked to COVID-19 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests and hospital emergency, inpatient and mortality registers. We included all patients in the database who were &#8805;15 years old and diagnosed with COVID-19 in outpatient settings between 15 March and 24 April 2020 (10 April for outcome studies). Baseline characteristics included socio-demographics, co-morbidity and previous drug use at the time of diagnosis, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and results. : Study outcomes included 30-day hospitalization for COVID-19 and all-cause fatality. RESULTS: We identified 118 150 and 95 467 COVID-19 patients for characterization and outcome studies, respectively. Most were women (58.7%) and young-to-middle-aged (e.g. 21.1% were 45-54 years old). Of the 44 575 who were tested with PCR, 32 723 (73.4%) tested positive. In the month after diagnosis, 14.8% (14.6-15.0) were hospitalized, with a greater proportion of men and older people, peaking at age 75-84 years. Thirty-day fatality was 3.5% (95% confidence interval: 3.4% to 3.6%), higher in men, increasing with age and highest in those residing in nursing homes [24.5% (23.4% to 25.6%)]. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infections were widespread in the community, including all age-sex strata. However, severe forms of the disease clustered in older men and nursing-home residents.

ezirpmbd,nan,WHO,Projecting demand for critical care beds during COVID-19 outbreaks in Canada,nan,nan,nan,unk,"BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Canada may create substantial demand for hospital admission and critical care. We evaluated the extent to which self-isolation of mildly ill people delays the peak of outbreaks and reduces the need for this care in each Canadian province. METHODS: We developed a computational model and simulated scenarios for COVID-19 outbreaks within each province. Using estimates of COVID-19 characteristics, we projected the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) bed requirements without self-isolation, assuming an average number of 2.5 secondary cases, and compared scenarios in which different proportions of mildly ill people practised self-isolation 24 hours after symptom onset. RESULTS: Without self-isolation, the peak of outbreaks would occur in the first half of June, and an average of 569 ICU bed days per 10 000 population would be needed. When 20% of cases practised self-isolation, the peak was delayed by 2-4 weeks, and ICU bed requirement was reduced by 23.5% compared with no self-isolation. Increasing self-isolation to 40% reduced ICU use by 53.6% and delayed the peak of infection by an additional 2-4 weeks. Assuming current ICU bed occupancy rates above 80% and self-isolation of 40%, demand would still exceed available (unoccupied) ICU bed capacity. INTERPRETATION: At the peak of COVID-19 outbreaks, the need for ICU beds will exceed the total number of ICU beds even with self-isolation at 40%.

The aim of our prospective single-centre clinical study was to assess the proportion of readable results and errors compared with routine antimicrobial susceptibility testing and the clinical consequences drawn by infectious disease (ID) physicians from RAST results during same-day bedside consultation. METHODS: All positive blood cultures suitable for RAST from January to December 2019 were included and RAST results at 4 and 6 h compared with standard disc diffusion. The real-life impact of RAST on clinical decisions was assessed during same-day ID bedside consultation. RESULTS: The proportion of readable RAST results was significantly higher after 6 h of incubation compared with after 4 h (881/930 versus 642/847; P < 0.0001). Major and very major errors were rare (17/642 after 4 h and 12/881 after 6 h; P = 0.087). ID consultation was performed in 134 patients after the RAST result. Antimicrobial treatment was changed in 73 patients and 84 additional measures (i.e. imaging studies, surgery, additional resistance testing) were ordered in 62 patients.

The current monitoring of transmission dynamics of infectious diseases is mainly based on reproduction number (R0) and fatality rates. However, this approach is a real-time monitoring of transmission dynamics for mitigating the numbers of COVID-19 related infected individuals and deaths. Reproduction number does not provide information to cope with future epidemics or pandemics. The main goal of this study is to propose the Index c (as contagions) that quantifies, ex-ante, the environmental risk of exposure of cities/regions to future epidemics of the COVID-19 and similar vital agents. This Index c synthetizes environmental, demographic, climatological and health risk factors of cities/regions that indicate their exposure to infectious diseases. Index c has a range from 1 (environmental and social weakness of urban areas leading to high levels of exposure to infectious diseases) to 0 (environment that reduces the risk of exposure to infectious diseases in society). The statistical evidence here, applied on case study of Italy, seems in general to support the predictive capacity of the Index c as a particularly simple but superior indicator in detecting the global correlation between potential risk of exposure of cities/regions to infectious diseases and actual risk given by infected individuals and deaths of the COVID-19. The Index c can support a proactive environmental strategy to help policymakers to prevent future pandemics similar to the COVID-19.",2020,"Coccia, Mario",Environ Res,nan,#733859,nan,nan,nan,nan,221466349.0

In answering questions raised regarding our study, we updated our database and repeated all analyses. METHODS: We re-evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction and/or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICUs of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital from ICU admission to death, ICU discharge or April 22nd 2020, whichever came first. RESULTS: We studied the same 184 ICU patients as reported on previously, of whom a total of 41 died (22%) and 78 were discharged alive (43%). The median follow-up duration increased from 7 to 14 days. All patients received pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome, adjusted for competing risk of death, was 49% (95% confidence interval [CI] 41–57%). The majority of thrombotic events were PE (65/75; 87%). In the competing risk model, chronic anticoagulation therapy at admission was associated with a lower risk of the composite outcome (Hazard Ratio [HR] 0.29, 95%CI 0.091–0.92). Patients diagnosed with thrombotic complications were at higher risk of all-cause death (HR 5.4; 95%CI 2.4–12).

While care is often thought of in terms of proximity, literature on 'landscapes of care' highlights the potential for 'care at a distance'. We extend this literature to examine practices of social distancing, specifically the act of maintaining a 'space between' bodies in communal areas - a practice currently brought to the fore by the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the CF clinic as a case study, we examine how distancing can be understood as an emplaced practice of care, shaped by - and shaping - architectures and materialities in particular contexts. We explore these issues drawing on data from Pathways, practices and architectures: containing antimicrobial resistance in the cystic fibrosis clinic, a UK AHRC funded study (AH/R002037/1) examining practices in three cystic fibrosis clinics using visual and ethnographic methods. Clinical staff practices of maintaining distancing were often regarded by patients as 'care-ful', part of personalised 'care in place', embroiling a wider care assemblage including ancillary staff, materialities and architectures. Patients also actively participate in distancing as an 'ethic of care', using strategies of 'holding back' and 'looking out' in confined spaces. Yet our findings also highlight tensions between care, proximity and distance in circulation spaces and communal areas, including transient spaces where the assemblage of care breaks down.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (Mpro) is a chymotrypsin-type cysteine protease that is needed to produce functional proteins essential for virus replication and transcription. Serpin traps its target proteases by presenting a reactive center loop (RCL) as protease-specific cleavage site, resulting in protease inactivation. Mpro target sites with its active site serine and other flanking residues can possibly interact with serpins. Alternatively, RCL cleavage site of serpins with known evidence of inhibition of cysteine proteases can be replaced by Mpro target site to make chimeric proteins. Purified chimeric serpin can possibly inhibit Mpro that can be assessed indirectly by observing the decrease in ability of Mpro to cleave its chromogenic substrate. Chimeric serpins with best interaction and active site binding and with ability to form 1:1 serpin–Mpro complex in human plasma can be assessed by using SDS/PAGE and Western blot analysis with serpin antibody.

This disease is caused by a novel coronavirus named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). It primarily affects the respiratory tract and particularly the lungs. The virus enters the cell by attaching its spike-like surface projections to the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) expressed in various tissues. Though the majority of symptomatic patients have mild flu-like symptoms, a significant minority develop severe lung injury with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to considerable morbidity and mortality. Elderly patients with previous cardiovascular comorbidities are particularly susceptible to severe clinical manifestations. BODY: Currently, our limited knowledge of the pathologic findings is based on post-mortem biopsies, a few limited autopsies, and very few complete autopsies. From these reports, we know that the virus can be found in various organs but the most striking tissue damage involves the lungs resulting almost always in diffuse alveolar damage with interstitial edema, capillary congestion, and occasional interstitial lymphocytosis, causing hypoxia, multiorgan failure, and death. A few pathology studies have also reported intravascular microthrombi and pulmonary thrombembolism. Although the clinical presentation of this disease is fairly well characterized, knowledge of the pathologic aspects remains comparatively limited. CONCLUSION: In this review, we discuss clinical, pathologic, and genomic features of COVID-19, review current hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis, and briefly discuss the clinical characteristics. We also compare the salient features of COVID-19 with other coronavirus-related illnesses that have posed significant public health issues in the past, including SARS and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).",2020,"Mohanty, Sambit K; Satapathy, Abhishek; Naidu, Machita M; Mukhopadhyay, Sanjay; Sharma, Shivani; Barton, Lisa M; Stroberg, Edana; Duval, Eric J; Pradhan, Dinesh; Tzankov, Alexandar; Parwani, Anil V",Diagn Pathol,nan,#713869,nan,nan,nan,nan,221129466.0

METHODS Between January 2005 and June 2010, 81 consecutive patients (46 men; mean age 69.1 years, range 43-86) underwent directional atherectomy (41 SH, 40 ELA) for femoropopliteal ISR lesions. Data were reviewed retrospectively on procedural outcomes, major adverse events, and 1-year target lesion revascularization (TLR) obtained from medical records and supplemented with telephone calls. The primary endpoint was symptom-driven TLR at 1 year; secondary endpoints were death and amputation.

8mrgivuh,nan,WHO,Geopolitical risk and tourism: Evidence from dynamic heterogeneous panel models,nan,nan,nan,unk,"This paper provides an empirical insight into how geopolitical risks impact international tourism demand. An augmented tourism demand function was developed and empirically estimated in line with classical theory for a panel of 16 countries from 2005M1 to 2017M12 through the AMG and CCEMG estimation techniques that address underlying heterogeneity, non-stationarity, and cross-sectional dependence. The study further examines the potential moderating effect of covid-19 outbreak on the relationship between geopolitical risk and tourism by investigating the interactive effect of past outbreaks and geopolitical risks on tourism demand. Additional insight on causal relations between geopolitical risks and tourism demand was obtained using panel bootstrapping technique. The results show that geopolitical risk negatively impacts tourism demand, and that pandemic outbreaks aggravate the negative impact of geopolitical risks on tourism demand. Panel causality outcomes further confirm that geopolitical risk is a significant predictor of tourism demand (captured by either tourism receipts or number of inbound tourists). Our findings confirm that the dynamic attributes of both local and international political environments significantly impact the consumption decision of tourists and the economic performance of tourist destinations. Our recommendation is that pre-crisis, in proposing policy directions for tourism sector development, policy-makers should establish crisis management plans to protect the tourism sector. Post-crisis, policy-makers should initiate aggressive recovery marketing strategies to re-establish the image of safety and attractiveness required to reassure potential tourists of the safety of the destination, thereby ensuring return to competitiveness and economic recovery.",2020,"Lee, Chien-Chiang; Olasehinde-Williams, Godwin; Akadiri, Seyi Saint",Int.

Therefore it is critical to determine efficiency of frozen section performance periodically. Objective To evaluate the accuracy of frozen section tests at different anatomical sites by comparing the frozen section diagnosis with the histological diagnosis. Method We conducted a retrospective study in Dhulikhel Hospital, Kathmandu University Hospital, Dhulikhel, and compared the results of 47 cases of frozen section with their final permanent section diagnosis during a period of January 2017 to December 2018. Result A total of 47 cases were studied on frozen section while no case was deferred for permanent paraffin section. The indication of frozen section was for presence/ typing of neoplasm in 38 cases (80.75%), clearance of margin in eight cases (17%) and diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease in one case (2.1%). The overall accuracy of frozen section was 91.4% (43 cases) with 8.5% (four cases) discordant with the diagnosis, reported as false negative. None of the cases were reported as false positive. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of frozen section in comparison with permanent section (as gold standard) were 85.18%, 100%, 100% and 83.33% respectively. Conclusion The accuracy of frozen section diagnosis at our institute was 91.4% which can be interpreted as comparable with most national and international studies. The overall error rate is 8.5% which is higher than previously published studies.

Data on transcatheter stenting of SPS is limited. We sought to evaluate feasibility, safety and outcomes of stenting SPS. METHODS Retrospective review of all patients who underwent transcatheter SPS stenting from 1/2006 to 12/2013. RESULTS Of 229 surgically implanted SPS, 25 transcatheter stent interventions were performed in 22 patients. The majority had pulmonary atresia (n = 9) or HLHS (n = 10). Their median age was 4 ms (range 10 days to 4 years) and median weight 4.9 kg (range 3-14). Nine had a central and 15 had a BT shunt with a median shunt size of 3.75 mm (range 3-6). The interval from shunt placement to intervention was 1.9 ms (range 4 days-3.8 years). The indication for intervention was increasing cyanosis in10 patients and delaying final repair in 9. Two patients were on ECMO at the time of intervention. The median shunt diameter increased from 2.3 to 4.1 mm and oxygen saturation from 72 to 85% (P < 0.001). No intra-procedural complications were encountered. One patient died from aspiration (autopsy demonstrated a patent shunt), 13 progressed to repair or next stage, 6 remain palliated with shunts as they are deemed unfit for the next stage and 2 are awaiting surgery.

Although they signal through distinct receptors, type I (IFN-α/β) and type III IFNs elicit remarkably similar responses in cells. However, in vivo, type III and type I IFN responses are not fully redundant as their respective contribution to the antiviral defense highly depends on virus species. IFN-λ is much more potent than IFN-α/β at controlling rotavirus infection. In contrast, clearance of several other viruses, such as influenza virus, mostly depends on IFN-α/β. The IFN-λ receptor was reported to be preferentially expressed on epithelial cells. Cells responsible for IFN-λ production are still poorly characterized but seem to overlap only partly IFN-α/β-producing cells. Accumulating data suggest that epithelial cells are also important IFN-λ producers. Thus, IFN-λ may primarily act as a protection of mucosal entities, such as the lung, skin or digestive tract. Type I and type III IFN signal transduction pathways largely overlap, and cross talk between these IFN systems occurs.

Since then, universal PCR based surveillance testing and PPE measures are in wide use in procedural settings. There is limited published experience on the utility and sustainability of PCR based surveillance testing in areas with receding and consistently low community COVID-19 rates. METHODS: The study was conducted at a tertiary care cancer center in NYC from March 22, 2020, until August 22, 2020. Asymptomatic patients underwent SARS CoV-2 testing before surgeries, interventional radiology procedures, and endoscopy. Contact tracing in procedural areas was done if a patient with an initial negative screen re-tested positive within 48 hours of the procedure. RESULTS: From March 22 until August 22, 2020, 11,540 unique patients underwent 14,233 tests before surgeries or procedures at MSKCC. Overall, 65 patients were positive, with a peak rate of 4.3% that fell below 0.3 % after April 2020. For the 65 positive cases, three were pre-symptomatic, and 38 were asymptomatic. Among asymptomatic test-positive patients, 76 % had PCR cycle threshold (Ct) > 30 at first detection. Five patients tested newly positive in the immediate post-operative period, exposing 82 employees with one case of probable transmission (1.2%). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection identified on pre-procedural surveillance was low in our study, which was conducted in an area with limited community spread at the later stage of the study Universal PPE is protective in procedural settings.

METHODS: The study included 63 patients, with hip or knee OA, who had been scheduled for arthroplasty that was postponed because of COVID-19. Patients were evaluated by telephone interviews during the first week after lockdown, in the fourth week, and again at the end of the lockdown. Patients rated their pain level on the basis of a visual analog scale (VAS) and completed WOMAC, SF-12 and Tegner activity scale (TAS) questionnaires. RESULTS: VAS and WOMAC scores increased significantly during lockdown, while physical activity significantly decreased. At the final evaluation, VAS and WOMAC showed a significant negative correlation with TAS. The SF-12 subscale scores showed a significant decrease of the physical component during the lockdown, while the mental component remained largely unchanged. Patients with knee OA showed a faster progress of pain compared to those with hip OA. 50 patients (79%) stated they wished to have arthroplasty as soon as possible.

The aim of our study was to evaluate whether a recently dynamic nomogram, established in the Chinese population and based on age, lymphocyte percentage and monocyte absolute count, might apply to a different context. We collected data from 299 patients (243 with COVID-19 and 56 with FLU) at Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza University of Rome. The nomogram included age, lymphocyte percentage and monocyte absolute count to differentiate COVID-19 from FLU. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for all associations. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Patients with COVID-19 had higher age, lymphocyte percentage and monocyte absolute count than patients with FLU. Although univariate analysis confirmed that age, lymphocyte percentage and monocyte absolute count were associated with COVID-19, only at multivariate analysis was monocyte count statistically significant as a predictive factor of COVID-19.

Frailty is strongly associated with vulnerability to illness and adverse health outcomes. We studied the impact of frailty on recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV) clinical outcomes. DESIGN/SETTING: Data from two previously conducted phase III randomized trials of RZV were pooled. These two parent trials were conducted concurrently at the same study sites using the same methods. PARTICIPANTS/INTERVENTION: In the two parent studies, participants aged &#8805;50 years (ZOE-50 study) and &#8805;70 years (ZOE-70 study), respectively, were randomized 1:1 to receive two doses of RZV or placebo. MEASUREMENTS: In the current ZOE-Frailty study (NCT03563183), a frailty index was created using previously validated methods. Clinical outcomes assessed by frailty status included vaccine efficacy, immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety. RESULTS: Of 29,305 participants from the pooled ZOE-50 and ZOE-70 total vaccinated cohort, 92% were included in this study. Mean age was 68.8 years; 58.1% were women; 45.6% were pre-frail and 11.3% frail. The percentage of frail participants increased with age from 5.7% aged 50-59 years to 22.7% aged &#8805;80 years. RZV vaccine efficacy against herpes zoster was >90% for all frailty subgroups (non-frail: 95.8% (95% confidence interval = 91.6-98.2), pre-frail: 90.4% (84.4-94.4), frail: 90.2% (75.4-97.0)). The RZV group demonstrated robust anti-gE antibody and gE-specific CD42+ responses, with mean concentrations remaining above pre-vaccination levels at least 3 years post-dose two, in all frailty subgroups. In the RZV group, the percentage of participants reporting solicited adverse events tended to decrease with increasing frailty. CONCLUSION: The relatively nonrestrictive inclusion/exclusion criteria in the parent ZOE studies resulted in a range of participants that included frail and pre-frail older adults.

They are essential in health-economic evaluations when calculating quality-adjusted life years. We investigated published studies reporting bariatric surgery-related HSUs elicited through direct or indirect (multiattribute utility instrument [MAUI]) patient-reported methods (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42019131725). Mean HSUs for different time points and HSU changes over time (where feasible) were meta-analysed using random-effects models. Of the 950 potentially relevant identified studies, n = 28 (2004-2018) qualified for data extraction, with n = 85 unique HSUs elicited mainly from the EQ-5D (88%). Most (75%) studies were published after 2013. The follow-up duration varied between studies and was often limited to 12 months. The pooled mean HSU was 0.72 (0.67-0.76) at baseline/presurgery (n = 18) and 0.84 (0.79-0.89) one-year postsurgery (n = 11), indicating a 0.11 (0.09-0.14) utility unit increment. EQ-5D showed the similar results. This positive difference can be partially explained by BMI and/or co-morbidities status improvement. This study provides a valuable summary of HSUs to future bariatric surgery-related cost-utility models.

Its spontaneous evolution remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the spontaneous evolution of olfactory disorders in COVID-19 patients. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: A total of 229 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from March 1 through 31, 2020 in our institution were included. Among them, 140 patients (mean age, 38.5 years, 89 women) reported sudden olfactory/gustatory disorders during COVID-19. All patients were interviewed by phone based on a questionnaire with 16 questions at time of survey. The primary end point was olfactory recovery rate at time of survey. RESULTS: The frequency of patients with olfactory disorders was higher before March 20, 2020 than since (70.3% vs. 53.9%, respectively) (P = .016). At time of survey (26 days of the mean time from anosmia onset), 95.71% reported to start an olfactory recovery. The mean time from olfactory loss onset to recovery onset was 11.6 days. Recovery started between the fourth and the fifteenth day after olfactory loss onset in 78.4% of patients. Complete olfactory recovery happened for 51.43% of patients. There was a significant relationship between the complete olfactory recovery and a short time from olfactory loss onset to recovery onset (P = .0004), absence of nasal obstruction (P = .023) and absence of sore/dry/tingling feeling in the nose (P = .007) in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of spontaneous evolution of olfactory disorders allows reassuring patients and planning therapeutic strategies for persistent olfactory dysfunction after having definitely recovered from COVID-19.

Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance.

Nationwide data have not been previously reported. We studied the outcomes of Swedish patients at 30 days after ICU admission. Methods We conducted a registry-based cohort study of all adult patients admitted to Swedish ICUs from 6 March-6 May, 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 disease and complete 30-day follow-up. Data including baseline characteristics, comorbidities, intensive care treatments, organ failures and outcomes were collected. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. A multivariable model was used to determine the independent association between potential predictor variables and the primary outcome. Results A total of 1563 patients were identified. Median ICU length of stay was 12 (5-21) days, and fifteen patients remained in ICU at the time of follow-up. Median age was 61 (52-69), median Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS III) was 53 (46-59), and 66.8% had at least one comorbidity. Median PaO2/FiO2 on admission was 97.5 (75.0-140.6) mmHg, 74.7% suffered from moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The 30-day all-cause mortality was 26.7%.

Qβ belongs to the family of Leviviridae and is found throughout the world (bacterial isolates and sewage). The genome of Qβ is about 4.2 kb, coding for four proteins. This genome is surrounded by 180 copies of coat proteins (capsomers) each comprised of 132 residues of amino acids. The other proteins, the subunit II (β) of a replicase, the maturation protein (A(2)) and the read-through or minor coat protein (A(1)), play a key role in phage infection. With the replicase protein, which lacks proofreading activity, as well as its short replication time, and high population size, Qβ phage has attractive features for in vitro evolution. The A(1) protein gene shares the same initiation codon with the coat protein gene and is produced during translation when the coat protein’s UGA stop codon triplet (about 400 nucleotides from the initiation) is suppressed by a low level of ribosome misincorporation of tryptophan. Thus, A(1) is termed the read-through protein. This RNA phage platform technology not only serves to display foreign peptides but is also exceptionally suited to address questions about in vitro evolution. The C-terminus of A(1) protein confers to this RNA phage platform an exceptional feature of not only a linker for foreign peptide to be displayed also a model for evolution. This platform was used to present a peptide library of the G-H loop of the capsid region P1 of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) called VP1 protein. The library was exposed on the exterior surface of Qβ phages, evolved and selected with the monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) SD6 of the FMDV. These hybrid phages could principally be good candidates for FMDV vaccine development. Separately, the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) epitopes was fused with the A(1) proteins and exposed on the Qβ phage exterior surface. The engineered phages with MPER epitopes were recognized by anti-MPER specific antibodies. This system could be used to overcome the challenge of effective presentation of MPER to the immune system. A key portion of this linear epitope could be randomized and evolved with the Qβ system. Overall, antigens and epitopes of RNA viruses relevant to public health can be randomized, evolved and selected in pools using the proposed Qβ model to overcome their plasticity and the challenge of vaccine development. Major epitopes of a particular virus can be engineered or displayed on the Qβ phage surface and used for vaccine efficacy evaluation, thus avoiding the use of live viruses.",2018-05-31,"Singleton, Rana L.; Sanders, Carrie A.; Jones, Kevin; Thorington, Bobby; Egbo, Timothy; Coats, Mamie T.; Waffo, Alain Bopda",Methods Protoc,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/fc3262c27f701261cfc1b27bc0495f6bd8b3e3fd.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6526423.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31164561/; https://doi.org/10.3390/mps1020018,90080760.0

We find strong and consistent evidence that foreign bank entry is associated with lower efficiency in host countries (host- country effect), while foreign expansion in the banking sector improves the efficiency of banks at home (home-country effect). We further observe that the effect of bank globalization is dependent on the regulatory and institutional regimes of the respective host (home) countries. Specifically, stringent activity restrictions, tight supervision, fewer limitations on foreign banks, lower market entry barriers, and less government interference all help mitigate the efficiency loss from foreign bank entry. Less supervision power, multiple supervisors, more restrictions on foreign banks, and a competitive banking market are all conducive to the higher efficiency gain of incumbent domestic banks from the respective country’s outward investments in the banking sector. Moreover, we find that the adverse impact on efficiency from foreign bank presence is less pronounced for less risky, more profitable, and larger banks, while banks that are more efficient, more profitable, taking on more risk, and/or smaller gain more efficiency from their country’s foreign expansion.",2020-08-05,"Yin, Haiyan; Yang, Jiawen; Lu, Xing",nan,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/7d38b0124696f64f0f31936d36d1ed52b4977673.json,nan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0275531920302300?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0275531920302300,220970190.0

There is particular controversy over the importance of aerosol transmission and whether airborne precautions should be recommended for some respiratory viruses. Here, we review the current recommendations of transmission-based precautions and the latest evidence on the aerosol transmission of respiratory viruses. RECENT FINDINGS Viral nucleic acids, and in some instances viable viruses, have been detected in aerosols in the air in healthcare settings for some respiratory viruses such as seasonal and avian influenza viruses, Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus and respiratory syncytial virus. However, current evidences are yet to demonstrate that these viruses can effectively spread via airborne route between individuals, or whether preventive measures in airborne precautions would be effective. SUMMARY Studies that use transmission events as outcome to demonstrate human-to-human transmission over the aerosol route or quantitative measurement of infectious respiratory viruses in the air are needed to evaluate the infectiousness of respiratory viruses over the aerosol route.

Many viruses, including MERS-CoV and the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) encode deubiquitinating (DUB) enzymes that are critical for viral replication and pathogenicity. They bind and remove ubiquitin (Ub) and interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) from cellular proteins to suppress host antiviral innate immune responses. A variety of viral DUBs (vDUBs), including the MERS-CoV papain-like protease, are responsible for cleaving the viral replicase polyproteins during replication, and are thereby critical components of the viral replication cycle. Together, this makes vDUBs highly attractive antiviral drug targets. However, structural similarity between the catalytic cores of vDUBs and human DUBs complicates the development of selective small molecule vDUB inhibitors. We have thus developed an alternative strategy to target the vDUB activity through a rational protein design approach. Here, we report the use of phage-displayed ubiquitin variant (UbV) libraries to rapidly identify potent and highly selective protein-based inhibitors targeting the DUB domains of MERS-CoV and CCHFV. UbVs bound the vDUBs with high affinity and specificity to inhibit deubiquitination, deISGylation and in the case of MERS-CoV also viral replicative polyprotein processing. Co-crystallization studies further revealed critical molecular interactions between UbVs and MERS-CoV or CCHFV vDUBs, accounting for the observed binding specificity and high affinity. Finally, expression of UbVs during MERS-CoV infection reduced infectious progeny titers by more than four orders of magnitude, demonstrating the remarkable potency of UbVs as antiviral agents. Our results thereby establish a strategy to produce protein-based inhibitors that could protect against a diverse range of viruses by providing UbVs via mRNA or protein delivery technologies or through transgenic techniques.",2017-05-18,"Zhang, Wei; Bailey-Elkin, Ben A.; Knaap, Robert C.

We validated a rapidly applicable, low-cost decontamination protocol in compliance with regulatory standards to enable the safe reuse of N95 respirators. METHODS: We inoculated 4 common models of N95 respirators with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and evaluated viral inactivation after disinfection for 60 minutes at 70°C and 0% relative humidity. Similarly, we evaluated thermal disinfection at 0% to 70% relative humidity for masks inoculated with Escherichia coli. We assessed masks subjected to multiple cycles of thermal disinfection for structural integrity using scanning electron microscopy and for protective functions using standards of the United States National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for particle filtration efficiency, breathing resistance and respirator fit. RESULTS: A single heat treatment rendered SARS-CoV-2 undetectable in all mask samples. Compared with untreated inoculated control masks, E. coli cultures at 24 hours were virtually undetectable from masks treated at 70°C and 50% relative humidity (optical density at 600 nm wavelength, 0.02 ± 0.02 v. 2.77 ± 0.09, p < 0.001), but contamination persisted for masks treated at lower relative humidity. After 10 disinfection cycles, masks maintained fibre diameters similar to untreated masks and continued to meet standards for fit, filtration efficiency and breathing resistance.

Objective: To identify clinical characteristics and key points of early differential diagnosis. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on suspected pediatric cases. Results:A total of 77 suspected cases were admitted from Jan 22nd to Mar 1st. Compared with non-2019-nCoV group (n=33),2019-nCoV confirmed group (n=35) had fewer fever (OR[95% CI] 0.39[0.242 to 0.628];P<.001) and symptoms of ARI (0.454[0.287 to 0.719];P<.001),more asymptomatic (15.086[2.117 to 107.475];P<.001), and more family cluster infections (5.469[2.405 to 12.433]; P<.001),while chest CT had more positive findings of viral pneumonia (1.813[1.131 to 2.908];P=.014).There were significant statistical differences between the two groups in age (7.2[3.9 to 11.4] vs 5[2.1 to 7.8];P=.031),body temperature (36.7[36.2 to 36.9] vs 37[36.7 to 37.9];P=.001), heart rate ([97.1 and 16.8] vs [109.7 and 15.6];P=.002),percentage ([39.4 and 14.9] vs [52.5 and 17.5]; P=.001) and count (2.25[1.43 to 3.53] vs 3.33[2.8 to 5.18];P=.007) of neutrophil, percentage (45.3[39.2 to 56.6] vs 33.2[22.7 to 42.5];P=.001) of lymphocyte,hs-CRP (5.52[1.1 to 9.04] vs 9.04[7.35 to 9.54];P=.002) and PCT (0.05[0.03 to 0.08] vs 0.1[0.05 to 0.21];P<.001),while gender (42.9% vs 57.6%;P=.332),respiratory rate (22[20 to 22] vs 22[20 to 24];P=.092),WBC (5.37[4.67 to 8.08] vs 6.94[5.72 to 8.87];P=.198), lymphocyte count (2.68[1.99 to 4.01] vs 2.26[1.66 to 2.92];P=.096),Hb (128[124 to 142] vs 130[119 to 137];P=.572) and PLT ([279.1 and 77.5] vs [263.4 and 65.1];P=.37) were statistically insignificant. Conclusions: Asymptoms or mild symptoms,positive CT findings and family cluster infection are the main clinical characteristics of infected pediatric patients. The CBC, hs-CRP and PCT can provide an important basis for early differential diagnosis. Compared with other non-bacterial infections,hs-CRP and PCT in 2019-nCoV infection are reduced,but further evidence is needed to support whether their reduction is specific.

METHODS: Constant, intermittent, and stepping-down SD strategies were modeled at 4 mean magnitudes (5%, 10%, 15% and 20%), 2 time windows (40-days, 80-days), and 2 levels of personal caution (30% and 50%). RESULTS: The stepping-down strategy was the best long-term SD strategy to minimize the peak number of active COVID-19 cases and associated deaths. The stepping-down strategy also resulted in a reduction in total time required to SD over a two-year period by 6.5% compared to an intermittent or constant SD strategy. An 80-day SD time-window was statistically more effective in maintaining control over the COVID-19 pandemic than a 40-day window. However, the results were dependent upon 50% of people being cautious (engaging in personal protection measures). CONCLUSION: If people exercise caution while in public by protecting themselves (e.g., wearing a facemask, proper hand hygiene and avoid agglomeration) the magnitude and duration of SD necessary to maintain control over the pandemic can be reduced. Our models suggest that the most effective way to reduce SD over a two-year period is a stepping-down approach every 80 days. According to our model, this method would prevent a second peak and the number of intensive care units needed per day would be within the threshold of those currently available.",2020-05-15,"Kennedy, Deanna M.; Zambrano, Gustavo José; Wang, Yiyu; Neto, Osmar Pinto",J Clin Virol,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/bc5dd21345dee339bd0592070ff7977ae30a7910.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7228692.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32425658/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653220301827?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2020.104440; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653220301827,218643928.0

Experiments were conducted with variable kaolin minerals mass contents (mixing ratios) in the soil columns. Measured saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) diminished with increased clay contents, i.e., Ks=0.00771, 0.00560, 0.00536, 0.00519, and 0.00314 cm s-1, for clay contents = 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5%, respectively. Experimental NaCl concentrations in the effluent from the bottom of the soil columns were about constant for times t &#8776; 800, 1200, 1300, 1400, and 3400 s from the beginning of a rinsing experiment for the clay contents = 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5%, respectively. These NaCl concentrations then decreased with time quickly, and finally, approached zero. The presented model can reproduce experimental time variations of NaCl concentration in the effluent from the soil column reliably. Simulated salt mass left in the soil column with time also matches the experimental results for the clay contents = 0.2 and 0.5%. An inconsistency between simulated and experimental salt mass left in the soil columns becomes more significant as the clay content increases. These results suggest that the soil-water retention curve for the pure Toyoura sand can be applied to the soil column composed of kaolin minerals/Toyoura sand mixture when the clay content is small, i.e., less than 1%. Prediction of rinsing process becomes more difficult with increased clay content. However, the time required to remove saline water from the soil column to less than 1% of its initial value simulated by the model agrees closely with experimental results of 1000, 1500, 1700, 2100, and 5400 s, respectively.",2021,"Higashino, Makoto; Aso, Daiki; Stefan, Heinz G",nan,nan,#33423196,nan,nan,nan,nan,231577919.0

Emergency regulatory changes allow buprenorphine initiation without an in-person visit. We describe the use of videoconferencing for buprenorphine initiation combined with street outreach to engage 2 patients experiencing homelessness with severe opioid use disorder (OUD). CASE PRESENTATION: Patient 1 was a 30-year-old man with severe OUD who had relapsed to injection heroin/fentanyl after incarceration. A community drop-in center outreach harm reduction specialist facilitated a videoconference with an addiction specialist at an OUD bridge clinic. The patient completed a community buprenorphine/naloxone initiation and self-titrated to his prior dose, 8/2 mg twice daily. One week later, he reconnected with the outreach team for a follow-up videoconference visit. Patient 2, a 36-year-old man with severe OUD, connected to the addiction specialist via a syringe service program harm reduction specialist. He had been trying to connect to a community buprenorphine/naloxone provider, but access was limited due to COVID-19, so he was using diverted buprenorphine/naloxone to reduce opioid use. He was restarted on his previous dose of 12/3 mg daily which was continued via phone follow-up 16 days later. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19-related regulatory changes allow buprenorphine initiation via telemedicine. We describe 2 cases where telemedicine was combined with street outreach to connect patients experiencing homelessness with OUD to treatment. These cases highlight an important opportunity to provide access to life-saving OUD treatment for vulnerable patients in the setting of a pandemic that mandates reduced face-to-face clinical interactions.",2020-05-20,"Harris, Miriam; Johnson, Samantha; Mackin, Sarah; Saitz, Richard; Walley, Alexander Y.; Taylor, Jessica L.",J Addict Med,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/98dc8180d5f54dce4f66195d10bd5d1ea3ebb4b3.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7273942.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32433364/; https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000682,218766330.0

However, human clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine failed to establish its usefulness as treatment for COVID-19. This compound is known to interfere with endosomal acidification necessary to the proteolytic activity of cathepsins. Following receptor binding and endocytosis, cathepsin L can cleave the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) proteins, thereby activating membrane fusion for cell entry. The plasma membrane-associated protease TMPRSS2 can similarly cleave these S proteins and activate viral entry at the cell surface. Here we show that the SARS-CoV-2 entry process is more dependent than that of SARS-CoV-1 on TMPRSS2 expression. This difference can be reversed when the furin-cleavage site of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is ablated or when it is introduced into the SARS-CoV-1 S protein. We also show that hydroxychloroquine efficiently blocks viral entry mediated by cathepsin L, but not by TMPRSS2, and that a combination of hydroxychloroquine and a clinically-tested TMPRSS2 inhibitor prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection more potently than either drug alone. These studies identify functional differences between SARS-CoV-1 and -2 entry processes, and provide a mechanistic explanation for the limited in vivo utility of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19.",2021-01-19,"Ou, Tianling; Mou, Huihui; Zhang, Lizhou; Ojha, Amrita; Choe, Hyeryun; Farzan, Michael",PLoS pathogens,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33465165/,231652106.0

METHODS Two hundred and eleven patients who had received RFA as first-line treatment for HCC were retrospectively analyzed. They had undergone gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI before treatment, and parameters including tumour size; margins; signal intensities on T1-, T2-, and diffusion-weighted images, and hepatobiliary phase images (HBPI); intratumoral fat or tumoral capsules; and peritumoural hypointensity in the HBPI were used to develop a prediction model for LTP after treatment. This model to discriminate low-risk from high-risk LTP groups was constructed based on Cox regression analysis. RESULTS Our analyses produced the following model: 'risk score = 0.617 × tumour size + 0.965 × tumour margin + 0.867 × peritumoural hypointensity on HBPI'. This was able to predict which patients were at high risk for LTP after RFA (p < 0.001). Patients in the low-risk group had a significantly better 5-year LTP-free survival rate compared to the high-risk group (89.6 % vs. 65.1 %; hazard ratio, 3.60; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION A predictive model based on MRI before RFA could robustly identify HCC patients at high risk for LTP after treatment.

As residents rely upon operative exposure and in-person didactic lectures for education, the disruptions caused by the pandemic have forced programs to revise how they educate residents. Here we surveyed program directors (PDs) to ascertain how they have altered the education and clinical care responsibilities of residents in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Surveys were sent to the PDs of all ACGME-accredited neurosurgery programs. Survey questions targeted changes in resident staffing and coverage, changes in didactic material delivery, and changes in resident wellness initiatives. PD concerns were also elicited. Results Of the 116 program PDs invited, 57 responded (49.1%). We found that most programs have reduced resident work weeks (65%) and in-hospital resident shift census (95%). Few have redeployed residents and most are increasingly relying on teleconferencing solutions for meetings and resident education. Most commonly programs are using faculty- (91%) or resident-led (65%) lectures, though nearly 75% are supplementing resident education with materials from the Congress of Neurological Surgeons (CNS). Continuing education in spite of decreased case volume and maintaining resident morale are cited as the most common concerns of PDs. Conclusion Here we find that there is great homogeneity in the responses of neurosurgical residency programs to the COVID-19 pandemic. Programs are increasingly incorporating teleconferencing platforms and third-party education materials, most commonly materials from the CNS. Additionally, most respondents indicated that their program has not redeployed residents in the care of COVID-19 positive patients.

nv6fkc1a,nan,WHO,"Multimorbidity, Polyiatrogenesis, and COVID-19",nan,nan,nan,unk,"To date, the strongest predictor for dying with COVID-19 is suffering from several chronic disorders prior to the viral infection. Pre-existing multimorbidity is highly correlated with socioeconomic inequality. In turn, having several chronic conditions is closely linked to multiple medication intake, especially in richer countries with good access to biomedical care. Owing to its vertical structure, biomedicine often risks giving multiple treatments in an uncoordinated way. Such lack of integrated care can create complex forms of iatrogenic harm. Multimorbidity is often exacerbated by a pharmaceuticalization of social deprivation in place of integrated care. In this article, I explore the possibility that clusters of over-medication are a contributing factor to higher death rates from COVID-19, especially in poorer areas within richer countries. Anthropological perspectives on the social embeddedness of multimorbidity and multiple medication use can expand our understanding of who is most vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.",2020,"Ecks, Stefan",Med. anthropol. q,nan,#957863,nan,nan,nan,nan,227281757.0

Understanding how health misinformation is transmitted is an urgent goal for researchers, social media platforms, health sectors, and policymakers to mitigate those ramifications. Deep learning methods have been deployed to predict the spread of misinformation. While achieving the state-of-the-art predictive performance, deep learning methods lack the interpretability due to their blackbox nature. To remedy this gap, this study proposes a novel interpretable deep learning approach, Generative Adversarial Network based Piecewise Wide and Attention Deep Learning (GAN-PiWAD), to predict health misinformation transmission in social media. Improving upon state-of-the-art interpretable methods, GAN-PiWAD captures the interactions among multi-modal data, offers unbiased estimation of the total effect of each feature, and models the dynamic total effect of each feature when its value varies. We select features according to social exchange theory and evaluate GAN-PiWAD on 4,445 misinformation videos. The proposed approach outperformed strong benchmarks. Interpretation of GAN-PiWAD indicates video description, negative video content, and channel credibility are key features that drive viral transmission of misinformation. This study contributes to IS with a novel interpretable deep learning method that is generalizable to understand other human decision factors. Our findings provide direct implications for social media platforms and policymakers to design proactive interventions to identify misinformation, control transmissions, and manage infodemics.",2020-12-21,"Xie, Jiaheng; Chai, Yidong; Liu, Xiao",nan,nan,nan,2101.01076,document_parses/pdf_json/591c30ea1cdb30c0d11fefcaf7261d3be53bf5d3.json,nan,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01076v1.pdf,230437650.0

Although these data are often stored in electronic health records (EHRs) and potentially very accessible, few studies on obesity and weight loss have used data derived from EHRs. We developed processes for obtaining data from the EHR in order to construct a database on patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. METHODS Clinical data obtained as part of standard of care in a bariatric surgery program at an integrated health delivery system were extracted from the EHR and deposited into a data warehouse. Data files were extracted, cleaned, and stored in research datasets. To illustrate the utility of the data, Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate length of post-operative follow-up. RESULTS Demographic, laboratory, medication, co-morbidity, and survey data were obtained from 2028 patients who had undergone RYGB at the same institution since 2004. Pre-and post-operative diagnostic and prescribing information were available on all patients, while survey laboratory data were available on a majority of patients. The number of patients with post-operative laboratory test results varied by test. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, over 74% of patients had post-operative weight data available at 4 years.

Their action is essential in living organisms facilitating electric signaling, muscle contraction or osmotic stress response among other effects. The protein and the lipid charges configure a polarized interface that yields local ionic concentrations and electric potentials that are very different from those of the bulk electrolyte. The combined effect of gradients of ionic concentration and electric potential causes the transport of ions through channels. Here we analyze charge regulation effects in different protein-lipid conformations, stressing how important is the role of electrostatic interactions in the ion channel function that traditionally has been rationalized paying attention mainly to changes in pore size.

However, major hepatectomies remain challenging. Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery is being employed for an increasing variety of surgical sites and indications. PRESENTATION OF CASE Three patients underwent LESS hepatectomy. A 36-year-old woman had LLS for a 38-mm adenoma, an 85-year-old woman an atypical resection of segment VI for a 12-mm hepatocellular carcinoma and a 41-year-old woman an atypical right anterior resection for a 9cm symptomatic FNH. Procedures were performed transperitoneally with a single-port device, via a 20-mm or 30-mm incision. Operative times were 110min for LLS, 100min for the atypical segment VI resection and 120min for the atypical right anterior liver resection. Blood loss was less than 50ml in the first two patients and 150ml in the third. Postoperative courses were uneventful. The first two patients were discharged on postoperative day 3 and the third on postoperative day 1. DISCUSSION To date, some case reports and series of LESS liver surgery have been published. We performed the reported hepatectomies after a considerable experience in laparoscopic hepatic surgery and after applying the LESS approach to other procedures. Our hepatectomy technique was not modified by the use of the single-port and results were very encouraging. CONCLUSION We believe that in selected patients, both peripheral resections and LLS are feasible by LESS surgery, with good intra-operative and post-operative results.",2014,"Tzanis, Dimitrios; Lainas, Panagiotis; Tranchart, Hadrien; Pourcher, Guillaume; Devaquet, Niaz; Perlemuter, Gabriel; Naveau, Sylvie; Dagher, Ibrahim",International journal of surgery case reports,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2013.11.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25108073/,19205378.0

The well-being of health care workers and society as a whole needs to be considered in management decisions. During the time of a pandemic, ethics principles may be based more on a utilitarian approach that emphasizes the common good. Thus, at times treatment decisions might result in delays in initiating therapy, modifying the radiation treatment course (such as to a short course rather than a long course of therapy), and the sequence of therapies, all to minimize viral exposure. It is important that altered therapy is based as much as possible on institutional or departmental decisions and, to the extent possible, not on a case-by-case basis.

One potential mechanism by which these microorganisms may cause PPROM is by increasing the concentration of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the membranes and amniotic fluid. We tested this hypothesis in a well-defined model system of genital infection with M. pulmonis, a natural reproductive pathogen of rats. METHOD OF STUDY Timed-pregnant, specific pathogen-free, Sprague-Dawley rats were infected with 10(7) CFU M. pulmonis at gestation day (gd) 14. Controls received an equivalent volume (100 microL) of sterile medium. At gd 18, rats were euthanized, and membranes and amniotic fluids were harvested and stored at -70 degrees C until analysis. Proteinase activity of amniotic fluid and membranes was resolved on discontinuous 7.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gelatin zymography gels. Band intensity was determined using a digital gel documentation system and the manufacturer's software (Kodak). RESULTS Gelatinolytic activity associated with a band similar in molecular weight to ProMMP-9 (92 kDa, the inactive precursor of MMP-9) was significantly increased in amniotic fluids and membranes harvested from M. pulmonis-treated pups at gd 18 when compared with tissues harvested from control pups. Both ProMMP-9 and ProMMP-2 (72 kDa, the inactive precursor of MMP-2) were increased in infected animals at gd 21.

Epidemiologic reports indicate that severity of illness increases with age. However, the reasons behind the relative protection of children and infants are unclear. Whether the rationale is host‐related or virus‐dependent is important to determine since the latter could change with viral mutations. We review factors that could affect the susceptibility of children to the novel coronavirus. METHODS: We search publications indexed on PUBMED. RESULTS: Descriptions of the pathophysiology of current and previous coronavirus infections suggest several viral targets and immunomodulatory pathways affecting the severity of illness. There is limited evidence to suggest age‐variability of viral cell receptors and transmembrane co‐factors required for coronavirus entry and replication. However, the ensuing cytokine storm and the effect of higher melatonin in children are age‐dependent and could explain decreased disease variability in children. CONCLUSION: We believe that current evidence suggests host factors can play a role in disease severity in children and thus may remain protective despite potential virus mutation in the future.

Paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, has an antioxidant effect in the vascular wall. We investigated whether paroxetine reduces myocardial ROS formation and LV remodeling following a MI. In a total of 32 Wistar rats, MI was induced by a 30-min ligation of the left anterior descending artery followed by 7- or 28-day reperfusion. During the 28 days of reperfusion, LV remodeling was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography (n = 20). After 28 days of reperfusion, the susceptibility to ventricular tachycardia was evaluated prior to sacrifice and histological assessment of myocyte cross-sectional area, fibrosis, and presence of myofibroblasts. Myocardial ROS formation was measured with dihydroethidium after 7 days of reperfusion in separate groups (n = 12).

One hypothesis is that stress signals released by aluminum-exposed necrotic cells play a role in modulating an immune response that contributes to the adjuvant’s effectiveness. We hypothesized that aluminum adjuvant-induced necrosis would be similar irrespective of cellular origin or composition of the adjuvant. To test this hypothesis, human macrophages derived from peripheral monocytic cell line (THP-1) and cells derived from the human brain (primary astrocytes) were evaluated. Three commercially available formulations of ABAs (Alhydrogel, Imject alum, and Adju-Phos) were examined. Alum was also used as a reference. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species formation, and production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were quantified. Cells were exposed to different concentrations (10-100 µg/mL) of the adjuvants for 24 h or 72 h. The two FDA approved adjuvants (Alhydrogel and Adju-Phos) decreased cell viability in both cell types. At the 72 h time point, the decrease in viability was accompanied with increased ROS formation. The size of the aluminum agglomerates was not relatable to the changes observed. After exposure to ABAs, astrocytes and macrophages presented a distinct profile of cytokine secretion which may relate to the function and unique characteristics of each cell type. These variations indicate that aluminum adjuvants may have differing capability of activating cells of different origin and thus their utility in specific vaccine design should be carefully assessed for optimum efficacy.",2020-04-29,"Nies, Isaac; Hidalgo, Krisha; Bondy, Stephen C.; Campbell, Arezoo",Environ Toxicol Pharmacol,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/a371a6768f09d071785438637df5b2ea5d19b354.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7189866.xml.json,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1382668920300806; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388105/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1382668920300806?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.etap.2020.103404,216642348.0

Our hypothesis is that use of subcutaneous sarilumab in early stages (window of opportunity) of COVID-19 moderate-severe pneumonia can prevent higher oxygenation requirements through non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation and decrease in-hospital stays, as well as death rate. The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety of sarilumab through hospitalisation and up to day 14 after discharge, compared to the control arm as assessed by incidence of serious and non serious adverse events (SAEs). In addition, as an exploratory objective, to compare the baseline clinical and biological parameters, including serum IL-6 levels, of the intervention population against controls of the same pandemic outbreak (using a propensity score) to search for markers that identify the best candidates for the treatment with subcutaneous IL-6R inhibitors and to attempt an approximation in the temporal frame of the ""window of opportunity"" TRIAL DESIGN: SARCOVID is an investigator-initiated single center randomised proof of concept study.

With the spread of COVID-19, pockets exist in every country with different viral expressions. In the Chareidi (‘ultra-orthodox’) religious community, for example, rates of COVID-19 transmission and dissemination are above average compared with other communities within the same countries. While viral spread in densely populated communities is common during pandemics, several reasons have been suggested to explain the blatant flouting of public health regulations. It is easy to fault the Chareidi population for their proliferation of COVID-19, partly due to their avoidance of social media and internet aversion. However, the question remains: who is to blame for their community crisis? The ethical argument suggests that from a public health perspective, the physician needs to reach out and share medical knowledge with the community. The public’s best interests are critical in a pandemic and should supersede any considerations of cultural differences. By all indications, therefore, the physician has an ethical obligation to promote population healthcare and share medical knowledge based on ethical concepts of beneficence, non-maleficence, utilitarian ethics as well as social, procedural and distributive justice. This includes the ethical duty to reduce health disparities and convey the message that individual responsibility for health has repercussions within the context of broader social accountability.

This study examines the feasibility, safety and incisional hernia rate of the use of a prophylactic intraperitoneal onlay mesh stripe (IPOM) to prevent incisional hernia following midline laparotomy. METHODS This prospective, randomized controlled trial randomly allocated patients undergoing median laparotomy either to mass closure of the abdominal wall with a PDS-loop running suture reinforced by an intraperitoneal composite mesh stripe (Group A) or to the same procedure without the additional mesh stripe (Group B). Primary endpoint was the incidence of incisional hernias at 2 years following midline laparotomy. Secondary endpoints are were the feasibility, the safety of the mesh stripe implantation including postoperative pain, and the incidence of incisional hernias at 5 years. RESULTS A total of 267 patients were included in this study. Follow-up data 2 years after surgery was available from 210 patients (Group A = 107; Group B = 103). An incisional hernia was diagnosed in 18/107 (17%) patients in Group A and in 40/103 (39%) patients in Group B (p < 0.001). A surgical operation due to an incisional hernia was conducted for 12/107 (11%) patients in Group A and for 24/103 (23%) patients in Group B (p = 0.039). In both groups, minor and major complications as well as postoperative pain are reported with no statistically significant difference between the groups, even in contaminated situations. CONCLUSIONS This first randomized clinical trial indicates that the placement of a non-absorbable IPOM-stripe with prophylactic intention may significantly reduce the risk for a midline incisional hernia.

Patients with cancer and other comorbidities are at increased risk for adverse outcomes in this infection. CASE In this case report we present a 75-year-old patient with a localized gastric adenocarcinoma, currently treated by perioperative chemotherapy regimen, who had an rT-PCR proven novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection. Laboratory and radiologic assessments were performed in order to assess disease severity; however, the findings were not altered in accordance with the findings associated with COVID-19 disease. RESULTS On the first hospital day the patient had a low grade fever with chills. Subsequently a pharmacological therapy with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was started. After pharmacologic and symptomatic treatment, the patient was reassessed for SARS-CoV-2, with negative results. At discharge, the patient was ordered a 14-day mandatory quarantine. After 57 days of follow-up, the patient underwent a new rapid antibody test by Acro Biotech inc., which gave negative results for IgM and IgG. CONCLUSION An infection with SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a more severe disease in patients with comorbidities and cancer; however, this case patient had a mild course of COVID-19 disease.

DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A designated hospital for patients with covid-19 in Zhejiang province, China. PARTICIPANTS: 96 consecutively admitted patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection: 22 with mild disease and 74 with severe disease. Data were collected from 19 January 2020 to 20 March 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Ribonucleic acid (RNA) viral load measured in respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples. Cycle threshold values, a measure of nucleic acid concentration, were plotted onto the standard curve constructed on the basis of the standard product. Epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained through data collection forms from electronic medical records, and the relation between clinical data and disease severity was analysed. RESULTS: 3497 respiratory, stool, serum, and urine samples were collected from patients after admission and evaluated for SARS-CoV-2 RNA viral load. Infection was confirmed in all patients by testing sputum and saliva samples. RNA was detected in the stool of 55 (59%) patients and in the serum of 39 (41%) patients. The urine sample from one patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The median duration of virus in stool (22 days, interquartile range 17-31 days) was significantly longer than in respiratory (18 days, 13-29 days; P=0.02) and serum samples (16 days, 11-21 days; P<0.001). The median duration of virus in the respiratory samples of patients with severe disease (21 days, 14-30 days) was significantly longer than in patients with mild disease (14 days, 10-21 days; P=0.04). In the mild group, the viral loads peaked in respiratory samples in the second week from disease onset, whereas viral load continued to be high during the third week in the severe group. Virus duration was longer in patients older than 60 years and in male patients. CONCLUSION: The duration of SARS-CoV-2 is significantly longer in stool samples than in respiratory and serum samples, highlighting the need to strengthen the management of stool samples in the prevention and control of the epidemic, and the virus persists longer with higher load and peaks later in the respiratory tissue of patients with severe disease.",2020-04-21,"Zheng, Shufa; Fan, Jian; Yu, Fei; Feng, Baihuan; Lou, Bin; Zou, Qianda; Xie, Guoliang; Lin, Sha; Wang, Ruonan; Yang, Xianzhi; Chen, Weizhen; Wang, Qi; Zhang, Dan; Liu, Yanchao; Gong, Renjie; Ma, Zhaohui; Lu, Siming; Xiao, Yanyan; Gu, Yaxi; Zhang, Jinming; Yao, Hangping; Xu, Kaijin; Lu, Xiaoyang; Wei, Guoqing; Zhou, Jianying; Fang, Qiang; Cai, Hongliu; Qiu, Yunqing; Sheng, Jifang; Chen, Yu; Liang, Tingbo",BMJ,nan,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7190077.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m1443; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32317267/,216074884.0

The disease progression associated with the pro-inflammatory host response prompted us to examine the role of early corticosteroid therapy in patients with moderate to severe COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a single pre-test, single post-test quasi-experiment in a multi-center health system in Michigan from March 12 to March 27, 2020. Adult patients with confirmed moderate to severe COVID were included. A protocol was implemented on March 20, 2020 using early, short-course, methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg/day divided in 2 intravenous doses for 3 days.

BACKGROUND: In the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults are more likely to be infected and develop serious outcomes than young people. Worldwide, senior-living facilities face a battle to protect their residents. Compared with age-related declines, the built environment is more modifiable and can be used for infection control. METHODS: This research conducted content analysis of the guidelines on COVID-19 control issued by the State Council of China in February 2020 for senior-living facilities. Six senior-living facility managers in China were interviewed and shared their experiences using these guidelines. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted to identify the essential environmental factors for infection control. RESULTS: Environmental factors suggested in the guidelines were analyzed for three groups of infection-control strategies: keep COVID-19 from entering the facility, prevent COVID-19 spread in the facility, and manage infection and illness. Key topics of experience using the guidelines were identified, including residents’ needs for social interaction and the difficulties of providing dedicated air-conditioning and circulation systems.

However, a vaccination program's efficacy largely depends on population compliance. We examined general population decision-making for pH1N1 vaccination using a modified Theory of Planned Behaviour (TBP). METHODOLOGY: We conducted a longitudinal study, collecting data before and after the introduction of pH1N1 vaccine in Hong Kong. Structural equation modeling (SEM) tested if a modified TPB had explanatory utility for vaccine uptake among adults. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among 896 subjects who completed both the baseline and the follow-up surveys, 7% (67/896) reported being “likely/very likely/certain” to be vaccinated (intent) but two months later only 0.8% (7/896) reported having received pH1N1 vaccination. Perception of low risk from pH1N1 (60%) and concerns regarding adverse effects of the vaccine (37%) were primary justifications for avoiding pH1N1 vaccination. Greater perceived vaccine benefits (β = 0.15), less concerns regarding vaccine side-effects (β = −0.20), greater adherence to social norms of vaccination (β = 0.39), anticipated higher regret if not vaccinated (β = 0.47), perceived higher self-efficacy for vaccination (β = 0.12) and history of seasonal influenza vaccination (β = 0.12) were associated with higher intention to receive the pH1N1 vaccine, which in turn predicted self-reported vaccination uptake (β = 0.30). Social norm (β = 0.70), anticipated regret (β = 0.19) and vaccination intention (β = 0.31) were positively associated with, and accounted for 70% of variance in vaccination planning, which, in turn subsequently predicted self-reported vaccination uptake (β = 0.36) accounting for 36% of variance in reported vaccination behaviour. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Perceived low risk from pH1N1 and perceived high risk from pH1N1 vaccine inhibited pH1N1 vaccine uptake. Both the TPB and the additional components contributed to intended vaccination uptake but social norms and anticipated regret predominantly associated with vaccination intention and planning. Vaccination planning is a more significant proximal determinant of uptake of pH1N1 vaccine than is intention.

In this article, we report our technique and experience. OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE With supine positioning, an umbilical trocar and three 5-mm trocars are positioned across the epigastrium. The gastrocolic ligament is opened completely and the stomach is retracted superiorly. A vessel-sealing electrosurgical device is used to dissect along the inferior margin of the pancreas. Dissection proceeds proximally or distally, depending on the location of the pathology. The proximal pancreatic duct is oversewn or stapled closed. The distal pancreas is mobilized from the splenic vessels. If the vessels cannot be mobilized from the pancreas, they are divided and a laparoscopic splenectomy is performed. The specimen is removed through the umbilical trocar by using a retrieval bag. Drains are placed prior to closure. CASE EXPERIENCE: We report 4 cases: 2 with pseudopapillary tumors and 2 with traumatic injuries. One patient was male; the mean age was 13.0 +/- 1.4 years. Two spleens were removed due to pathology. Mean operative time was 256 +/- 46.6 minutes, with no open conversion or mortality. Patients initiated oral intake 2.0 +/- 1.4 days postoperatively. Hospital stay was 6.2 +/- 3.9 days. One patient required 15 days of total parenteral nutrition to resolve a pancreatic fistula. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic pancreatic resection in children is feasible, safe, and leads to rapid recovery without significant morbidity. The spleen can often be spared, minimizing the risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis.

We conducted a qualitative synthesis of the literature to summarize and interpret knowledge of African immigrants' parenting practices and challenges in destination countries to identify future directions for research, policy, and practice. ELIGIBILITY We used a qualitative research synthesis method involving meta-summary and meta-synthesis of the literature. A research librarian assisted in searching ten databases. Two members of the research team independently reviewed 1794 articles. We included articles that: (a) reported a qualitative research study; (b) was written in English; and (c) provided the perspective of African immigrant parents on their parenting practices and/or challenges. SAMPLE A total of 24 articles met our inclusion criteria. RESULTS Our results indicate that parenting practices of African immigrants include the following: changes in discipline practices across transnational borders and the use of physical discipline, respect as a deeply embedded value of parenting, integration of cultural values into parenting, and integration of religious practices into parenting. We also found gender differences in parenting. Challenges faced by African immigrants in parenting their children in destination countries include lack of informal/community support, access to services and lack of formal support, cultural conflict in parenting, fear related to social services, and language barriers.

Small case series have been reported in the literature but few studies with a large number of patients have been published. We present our experience with the SFD for the treatment of intracranial aneurysms in Canada. METHODS Centers across Canada using SFDs were contacted to fill out a case report form for patients treated with an SFD in their center. Individual centers were responsible for approval from their ethics committee. Image analysis was performed by individual operators. The case report forms were collected and the final analysis was performed. RESULTS A total of 92 patients were treated with SFDs in eight centers in Canada between January 2009 and August 2013. The aneurysms were located in the posterior circulation in 16 patients and in the anterior circulation in 76 patients. Most aneurysms (75%) were saccular in shape; 22% were fusiform and 3% were blister aneurysms. The size of the aneurysms varied from 2 to 60 mm with the neck varying from 2 to 60 mm. Perioperative morbidity and mortality were 8.7% and 2.2%, respectively. At the last available follow-up, 83.1% of the aneurysms were either completely or near-completely occluded. The rate of complications was higher for fusiform aneurysms (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS The SFD appears to be an important tool for the treatment of complex intracranial aneurysms.

Fecal shedding occurred in 33 (91.7 %) experimentally challenged calves and in none of the control calves. There was a difference in the log-total number of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight among the four exposure groups; calves with the lowest magnitude of exposure (1 × 10(3) oocysts) shed less than the other three groups. At higher magnitudes of exposure, there was more variability in the range of fecal oocyst shedding. There was an inverse relationship between the log-total amount of oocysts counted per gram of feces dry weight and the number of days to the onset of fecal shedding per calf, i.e., the more time that elapsed to the onset of fecal shedding, the fewer oocysts that were shed. The pattern of fecal shedding over time for all calves shedding oocysts was curvilinear; the number of oocysts increased with time, reached a peak, and declined.

igwmvfrl,nan,WHO,The plausible mechanisms of tramadol for treatment of COVID-19,nan,nan,nan,unk,"Currently, no single medication has been approved for the management of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, drug repositioningby investigating the use of existing drugs for management of COVID-19 patients is considered a desperate need. Tramadol is a commonly prescribed analgesic drug for treatment of moderate to severe pain with less potential for dependence and respiratory depression. Multiple evidence support that tramadol is a promising drug for treatment of COVID-19 patients. Herein, we discuss the possible beneficial effects of using tramadol against SARS-CoV-2 infection and their underlying mechanism of action. The anti-inflammatory effect of tramadol may help to suppress the COVID-19 related cytokine storm through decreasing interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#945;), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Besides, tramadol activates natural killer (NK) and T-cells and enhances IL-2 secretion, which produce immune-enhancing effect against SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies confirmed that COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure showed increased fibrin formation and polymerization that may lead to thrombosis. Tramadol owing to its hypocoagulable effect may protect against venous thromboembolism in these patients. Moreover, tramadol can exert a cardioprotective effect via decreasing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level which is elevated in most of patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, the severity and mortality of COVID-19 have been correlated with old age patients, which may be due to the lack of antioxidant mechanisms and increased oxidative damage. Tramadol could protect COVID-19 patient from disease complications by increases the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase while diminished malondialdehyde. More interestingly, tramadol as an effective analgesic and antitussive may have a beneficial effect on COVID-19 patients suffering from cough, headache, ache, and pain. The tramadol anti-psychotic effect may also protect against psychiatric disorders associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, tramadol has bactericidal activity against a wide range of pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa which is common in severe COVID-19 patients leading to pneumonia with worse clinical outcomes. Therefore, we hypothesize that tramadol might be a promising adjuvant therapeutic option against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Based on that, tramadol should be considered as adjuvant therapy for COVID-19 clinical trials.",2021,"El-Ashmawy, Nahla E; Lashin, Abdel-Halim A; Okasha, Kamal M; Abo Kamer, Amal M; Mostafa, Tarek M; El-Aasr, Mona; Goda, Ahmed E; Haggag, Yusuf A; Tawfik, Haytham O; Abo-Saif, Mariam A",Med Hypotheses,nan,#988863,nan,nan,nan,nan,230107443.0

We report our midterm and long-term results with the staple aneurysmorrhaphy technique to repair and preserve aneurysmal AVFs. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our surgical treatment of patients with aneurysmal autogenous AVF complicated by skin erosion, bleeding, infection, pain, and difficulty with needle access from 2007 through 2014. We identified 52 patients, 40 (77%) of whom underwent repair with the staple aneurysmorrhaphy technique. The operation involved mobilizing the entire aneurysmal segments. A TA (Covidien, Norwalk, Conn) or Endo GIA (Covidien, Mansfield, Mass) stapler was used to resect the redundant aneurysm wall to create a 6- to 8-mm-diameter conduit. A subcutaneous skin flap was created after excising compromised skin. The remodeled vein was repositioned underneath the subcutaneous flap, with the staple line rotated laterally to avoid needle puncture. RESULTS We attempted staple aneurysmorrhaphy in 40 patients with complicated AVF aneurysms, of which 38 repairs (95%) were successful. Median patient age was 66 years (range, 29-88 years). Median AVF age was 63 months (range, 12-136 months). Median follow-up was 20 months (range, 5-81 months). At 1 year, primary patency was 67%, assisted primary patency was 88%, and secondary patency was 91%. At 2 years, primary patency was 59%, assisted primary patency was 84%, and secondary patency was 91%. At 3 years, primary patency was 46%, assisted primary patency was 69%, and secondary patency was 85%. Surgery was performed under local-regional anesthesia in 28 patients (70%) and under general anesthesia in the remaining 12 (30%). Proximal venous outflow stenoses were detected in 19 of 40 AVFs (48%) preoperatively and in 11 of 38 AVFs (29%) postoperatively. Aneurysm recurrence occurred in two repaired AVFs. CONCLUSIONS Our experience with staple aneurysmorrhaphy shows that it is an effective, safe, and durable procedure to preserve a functioning autogenous AVF with complicated aneurysmal degeneration. Key principles are to reduce the vein to normal adjacent diameter and to provide healthy skin coverage. The remodeled AVF has a low aneurysm recurrence rate and maintains the beneficial properties of superior patency and low infection. It is important to aggressively monitor for and treat proximal outflow venous stenoses to prevent aneurysm recurrence. The surgery can be done safely under local anesthesia in selected patients.",2015,"Vo, Trung; Tumbaga, Gloria; Aka, Paul; Behseresht, Jason; Hsu, Jeffrey; Tayarrah, Majid",Journal of vascular surgery,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2014.09.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25441668/,25553583.0

According to the anatomy of the tibial nerve, ankle dorsiflexion and eversion movements could be used to perform the tibial neurodynamic test (TNT). To date, no study has documented the normal responses of the TNT. OBJECTIVE: To document normal responses of the TNT in asymptomatic individuals and to investigate influences from sex and leg dominance. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with 44 asymptomatic volunteer subjects, a total of 88 lower limbs, was carried out. The range of motion (ROM), quality, and distribution of sensory responses were recorded. The hip flexion ROM was measured when subjects reported an intensity of their symptoms of 2/10 (P1) and 8/10 (P2). RESULTS: The mean ROM for hip flexion at P1 was 44.22 ± 13.13&#8728; and 66.73 ± 14.30&#8728; at P2. Hip flexion was significantly greater at P2 than P1 (p< 0.001). However, it was not different between sex or limbs (p> 0.05). The descriptor of the quality of sensory responses most often used by participants was stretching (88.6% and 87.5% for P1 and P2, respectively) in the popliteal fossa and posterior calf.

In this study, we synthesized several EDI prodrugs featuring an imidazoquinoline immunostimulant resiquimod (a Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist) covalently modified with glycosidase enzyme-directing groups selected from substrates of β-glucuronidase, α-mannosidase, or β-galactosidase. We compared the glycosidase-dependent immunogenicity elicited by each EDI in RAW-Blue macrophages following conversion to active immunostimulant by complementary glycosidase. At a cellular level, we examined EDI metabolism across three cancer cell lines (B16 melanoma, TC2 prostate, and 4T1 breast cancer). Comparing the relative immunogenicity elicited by each EDI/cancer cell combination, we found that B16 cells produced the highest EDI prodrug immunogenicity, achieving >95% of that elicited by unmodified resiquimod, followed by TC2 and 4T1 cells (40% and 30%, respectively). Immunogenicity elicited was comparable for a given cell type and independent of the glycosidase substrate in the EDIs or differences in functional glycosidase activity between cell lines. Measuring drug efflux of the immunostimulant payload and efflux protein expression revealed that EDI/cancer cell-mediated immunogenicity was governed by efflux potential of the cancer cells. We determined that, following EDI conversion, immunostimulant efflux occurred through both P-glycoprotein-dependent and P-glycoprotein-independent transport mechanisms. Overall, this study highlights the broad ability of EDIs to couple immunogenicity to the metabolism of many cancers that exhibit drug efflux and suggests that designing future generations of EDIs with immunostimulant payloads that are optimized for drug efflux could be particularly beneficial.",2020-05-25,"Ryan, Austin T; Pulukuri, Anunay J; Davaritouchaee, Maryam; Abbasi, Armina; Hendricksen, Aaron T; Opp, Larissa K; Burt, Anthony J; Nielsen, Amy E; Mancini, Rock J",Acta Pharmacol Sin,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/4873d807eb6689025eb4251fb38f80cd164a4eb5.json; document_parses/pdf_json/486d86b66ee71f0318ba4dd0978e879ead3f3ff8.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7470892.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7470892/,nan

To reduce the interpersonal transmission of coughed particles, the objective of this study was to analytically and experimentally investigate the performance of downward plane jets with various discharge velocities. Chamber measurements were conducted to examine the interaction between a transient cough jet (discharge velocities of 12 m/sec and 16 m/sec) and a steady downward plane jet (discharge velocities from 1.0-8.5 m/sec) with respect to the transport of and human exposure to coughed particles. The results show that a relatively high-speed cough can easily penetrate a downward plane jet with a discharge velocity of less than 6 m/sec. A downward plane jet with a discharge velocity of 8.5 m/sec can bend the cough jet to a certain extent. In this study, momentum comparison of the cough jet and the downward plane jet shows that the value of personal exposure to coughed particles depends on the ratio of jet momentums. The results show that when the two momentums are equivalent or if the downward plane jet has a greater momentum, the cough jet is deflected downward and does not reach the breathing zone of the target thermal dummy. Using the ratio of the two momentums, it may be estimated whether the transmission of a cough jet can be controlled. A trajectory model was developed based on the ratio of the two momentums of a cough jet and a downward jet and was validated using the experimental data. In addition, the predicted trajectory of the cough jet agreed well with the results from smoke visualization experiments.

It is necessary to provide evidence on its unprecedented psychological effects to develop effective psychological interventions. The current study aims to determine the anxiety severity level, coping strategies, and influencing factors in response to the COVID-19 pandemic among people aged 15 years and above in Gonabad, Iran. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey via online questionnaires between February and March 2020. We evaluated the anxiety severity levels and coping strategies using the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS) and Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations-Short Form (CISS-SF), respectively. Multinomial and ordinal logistic regression models were used to identify the predictors of coping strategies and anxiety. RESULTS: Totally, 500 people completed the questionnaires (response rate: 73%). Of them, 53.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 48.9%- 57.8%) suffered moderate to severe levels of anxiety. More than half of the respondents (52.0%; 95% CI: 47.5%-56.4%) utilized emotional-based or avoidant coping strategies. People with no academic education (odds ratio [OR]: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.41- 3.31) and without physical exercise (OR: 2.04; 95% CI: 1.22-3.33) preferred emotional-based coping instead of problem-based coping strategy. Female gender (OR: 1.60, 95%, CI: 1.13-2.28), underlying medical conditions (OR: 2.52, 95% CI: 1.65-3.87), and emotional-based coping (OR: 4.06, 95% CI: 2.76-5.99) were associated with higher severity levels of anxiety. CONCLUSION: The severity of anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic was significant among participants.

It is important to identify malnourished patients and take preventive therapeutic action before surgery. However, there is no evidence regarding which existing nutritional assessment score (NAS) is best suited to predict outcomes of liver surgery. Methods All patients scheduled for elective liver resection at the surgical department of the University Hospital of Heidelberg and the Municipal Hospital of Karlsruhe were screened for eligibility. Twelve NASs were calculated before operation, and patients were categorised according to each score as being either at risk or not at risk for malnutrition. The association of malnutrition according to each score and occurrence of at least one major complication was the primary endpoint, which was achieved using a multivariate logistic regression analysis including established risk factors in liver surgery as covariates. Results The population consisted of 182 patients. The percentage of patients deemed malnourished by the NAS varied among the different scores, with the lowest being 2.20% (Mini Nutritional Assessment) and the highest 52.20% (Nutritional Risk Classification).

METHODS: Rheumatology patients at a single centre received via text message the national Rheumatology Association COVID‐19 information sheet and an invitation to participate in a de‐identified survey. Patient concerns regarding risks conferred by their rheumatological disease or medications, impact of receiving the information sheet on the likelihood of staying on medication, and acceptance of telehealth, were ascertained. RESULTS: 2,630 patients received the message and the survey response rate was 21% (n=550). Mean (±SD) age was 52 (±15.2) years and 75% were female. Participants’ highest ranked concern was that their medications would increase their severity of COVID‐19 (76.1%). The highest levels of concern were seen in patients on combination conventional synthetic disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and/or a biologic/targeted synthetic disease‐modifying anti‐rheumatic drug (b/tsDMARD). There was no association between prednisolone dose and concern. While 63% of patients planned to continue their anti‐rheumatic medications, a further 30% were more likely to stay on their medications as a result of receiving the information. Telehealth was acceptable to 98.4% of patients, but 28.1% felt this was only appropriate while infection control measures were in place. CONCLUSION: Concerns regarding the risk of COVID‐19 among patients on anti‐rheumatic drugs are common.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, observational, single-arm, post-marketing study included 67 patients undergoing cataract surgery with bilateral implantation of TFNT00 across five Indian sites. Postoperative outcomes were assessed at 3 months after second eye surgery. Effectiveness outcomes included: mean binocular and monocular visual acuity (VA) at distance (4 m), intermediate (60 cm), and near (40 cm); binocular defocus curve; manifest refraction; and subjective symptom questionnaire evaluation. Safety outcomes included the rate of ocular adverse events and mesopic contrast sensitivity. RESULTS: Mean binocular and monocular distance-corrected and uncorrected VAs of 0.1 logMAR or better (approximately 20/25 Snellen) were achieved at distance, intermediate, and near. Overall, ≥70% of patients achieved binocular 0.1 logMAR vision or better across all distances. TFNT00 maintained a mean VA of 0.1 logMAR or better at the defocus range of +0.5 diopters (D) to –2.5 D (200 cm to 40 cm). The subjective symptom questionnaire-assessed frequency of halo visual disturbances was low at Month 3; halos were reported “none of the time” to “only some of the time” in 86.6% of patients. The large majority of patients (98.5%) were “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with their near, intermediate, and distance vision at Month 3, and ≥94.0% of patients reported spectacle independence for tasks at all distances. The adverse event rate was low; no patients discontinued due to an adverse event. CONCLUSION: TFNT00 provided a continuous range of vision of 20/25 or better for distance to near and performed effectively at an intermediate functional distance of 60 cm, resulting in high levels of spectacle independence and patient satisfaction.

OBJECTIVE This umbrella review aimed to synthesise the combined evidence from systematic reviews assessing the impact of person-centred care interventions on patient safety. DESIGN A three-step review process included a preliminary review of literature, a comprehensive search, and manual searching of reference lists and forward citations of selected reviews. The review protocol was registered with Prospero (CRD42018090048). DATA SOURCES Reviewers searched 10 databases for systematic reviews published in English-language peer-reviewed journals between 2000 and 2019: Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, JBI Database, Medline, ProQuest Health & Medicine, PROSPERO Register, PubMed and Scopus. REVIEW METHODS Covidence software was used to manage screening and eligibility. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, reviewed full texts of articles for eligibility, and appraised the quality of reviews using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses. RESULTS From an initial total of 3412 potential titles, 16 reviews met the inclusion criteria. The selected reviews examined the impact of person-centred care for diverse groups of patients (children, adults and older people) in varied settings. Most systematic reviews assessed experimental studies, generally comparing person-centred interventions with 'usual care', often demonstrating limited evidence of impact on safety. Reviews addressed several patient safety outcomes relevant to nursing, including falls, infections, medication use and misuse, and mortality rates. The systematic reviews were generally well conducted, although several included studies of poor or fair quality. Given the heterogeneity of the interventions, outcomes and research designs of studies included in the selected reviews, we were unable to draw unequivocal conclusions about the implications of person-centred care for patient safety in this umbrella review. However, there was some encouraging evidence that person-centred care initiatives may result in reduced rates of falls (in acute care and residential aged care settings). The review also highlighted reductions in agitation for people with dementia and some improvement in anti-psychotic medication use in older people with dementia. CONCLUSIONS Although abundant evidence exists demonstrating the positive effects of person-centred care on healthcare quality and on patient (and provider) wellbeing, there is little research focussing specifically on the impact of person-centred care on patient safety. Thus, there is scope for further high-quality nursing research into how person-centred interventions improve specific patient safety outcomes in order to inform more widespread adoption of person-centred practice.",2020-06-02,"Rossiter, Chris; Levett-Jones, Tracy; Pich, Jacqueline",International journal of nursing studies,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2020.103658; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32593882/,219902386.0

Viral infections of cultivated shellfish, crustacea, and finfish have been frequently recognized in the past few years. In the Asian regions, penaeid shrimp and several teleost fish underwent epizootics associated with heavy losses in aquaculture. Baculoviruses are particularly harmful to shrimp and prawns. Herpes-, irido-, reo-, or rhabdovirus-like agents can cause outbreaks in fish farms. Viral diseases are important limiting factors in the expansion of aquaculture. However, studies on viral infections of aquatic animals have been focused primarily on economically important farmed fish. Therfore, certain viral diseases of teleost fish are relatively well understood. In contrast, our knowledge of viral infections of farmed aquatic invertebrates is still very spare. Although a great number of viruses have been detected in farmed molluscs and crustaceans, the pathogenicity and epizootiology of most of the agents is not known.",1994-12-31,"Ahne, W.",Annual Review of Fish Diseases,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/1fd3a230c3b8aeb13f2e1c5ea6b82dc19573633a.json,nan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288350/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0959803094900361; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0959803094900361; https://doi.org/10.1016/0959-8030(94)90036-1,83717280.0

METHODS: A multicentre observational study was performed from 22 February through 30 June 2020. We included consecutive adult patients with severe COVID-19, defined as respiratory rate &#8805;30 breath per minute, oxygen saturation &#8804;93% on ambient air or arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen &#8804;300 mm Hg. We excluded patients being treated with other immunomodulant drugs, receiving low-dose corticosteroids and receiving corticosteroids 72 hours after admission. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality from hospital admission. The main exposure variable was corticosteroid therapy at a dose of &#8805;0.5 mg/kg of prednisone equivalents. It was introduced as binomial covariate in a logistic regression model for the primary endpoint and inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. RESULTS: Of 1717 patients with COVID-19 evaluated, 513 were included in the study, and of these, 170 (33%) were treated with corticosteroids. During hospitalization, 166 patients (34%) met the criteria of the primary outcome (60/170, 35% in the corticosteroid group and 106/343, 31% in the noncorticosteroid group). At multivariable analysis corticosteroid treatment was not associated with lower 30-day mortality rate (adjusted odds ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.20-1.74; p 0.33). After inverse probability of treatment weighting, corticosteroids were not associated with lower 30-day mortality (average treatment effect, 0.05; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.09; p 0.12). However, subgroup analysis revealed that in patients with PO2/FiO2 < 200 mm Hg at admission (135 patients, 52 (38%) treated with corticosteroids), corticosteroid treatment was associated with a lower risk of 30-day mortality (23/52, 44% vs. 45/83, 54%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.04-0.90; p 0.036).

METHOD We reviewed the literature to investigate clinical outcomes and the rates of recanalization, symptomatic intracerebral hematoma, and mortality in mechanical thrombectomy performed using second-generation thrombectomy devices. We compared the outcomes between patients treated for M2 and M1 occlusions. RESULTS Seven studies involving 805 patients with M2 thrombectomy were included in this meta-analysis. The functional independence rate 90 days after thrombectomy (modified Rankin Scale 0-2) was 59.3% (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.74-1.88). The recanalization rate (thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 0-2) was 84.16% (OR 2.32, 95% CI 2.08-2.29). The symptomatic intracerebral hematoma rate was 4.9% (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03-1.09). The mortality was 7.7% (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.13). The outcomes were better in patients with M2 occlusion than in those with M1 occlusion. In a subgroup analysis, we found that among patients with hypertension, mechanical thrombectomy achieved better functional outcomes and recanalization in M2 occlusion than M1 occlusion. CONCLUSION Mechanical thrombectomy performed with second-generation thrombectomy devices for M2 occlusion can provide a good functional outcome as well as satisfying recanalization.

An alternate entry receptor for the virus was recently proposed to be basigin/CD147. These early studies have already prompted a clinical trial and multiple published hypotheses speculating on the role of this host receptor in viral infection and pathogenesis. Here, we report that we are unable to find evidence supporting the role of basigin as a putative spike binding receptor. Recombinant forms of the SARS-CoV-2 spike do not interact with basigin expressed on the surface of human cells, and by using specialized assays tailored to detect receptor interactions as weak or weaker than the proposed basigin-spike binding, we report no evidence for a direct interaction between the viral spike protein to either of the two common isoforms of basigin. Finally, removing basigin from the surface of human lung epithelial cells by CRISPR/Cas9 results in no change in their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Twelve preweaned Holstein bull calves were blocked in pairs and randomly assigned as unexposed controls (n=6) bedded with control sand, or exposed calves (n=6) bedded with sand previously positive for M. bovis at a dairy farm. Bedding sand was cultured weekly. Nasal and ear swabs and sera were collected weekly, tracheal swabs were collected monthly, and by the end of the 105-d study, all calves were euthanized (n=10) or died (n=2). Sera were tested for M. bovis-specific antibody. Mycoplasma spp. culture was performed on nasal and ear swabs; culture and a PCR differentiating multiple Mycoplasma spp. were performed on postmortem samples of lung, retropharyngeal lymph node, and trachea from each calf. A complete necropsy also was performed. During 6 wk, mycoplasma concentration in exposed group sand was between 200 and 32,000 cfu/g. All 166 tracheal swabs, nasal and ear swabs, and postmortem tests from all calves were negative for mycoplasma. All 94 sera were negative for M. bovis-specific antibody. No gross pathology suggestive of mycoplasma disease was detected. The probability of mycoplasma detection, if an exposed calf had become infected 4 wk after exposure, ranged between 97 and 99% depending on time of exposure for individual calves.

Modulation of TTP expression is implicated in inflammation; however, its role in acute lung inflammation remains unknown. Accordingly, we tested the role of TTP in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) in mice. LPS-challenged TTP-knockout (TTP(KO)) mice, as well as myeloid cell-specific TTP-deficient (TTP(myeKO)) mice, exhibited significant increases in lung injury, although these responses were more robust in the TTP(KO). Mice with systemic overexpression of TTP (TTP(ΔARE)) were protected from ALI, as indicated by significantly reduced neutrophilic infiltration, reduced levels of neutrophil chemoattractants, and histological parameters of ALI. Interestingly, while irradiated wild-type (WT) mice reconstituted with TTP(KO) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) showed exaggerated ALI, their reconstitution with the TTP(ΔARE) HPCs mitigated ALI. The reconstitution of irradiated TTP(ΔARE) mice with HPCs from either WT or TTP(ΔARE) donors conferred significant protection against ALI. In contrast, irradiated TTP(ΔARE) mice reconstituted with TTP(KO) HPCs had exaggerated ALI, but the response was milder as compared to WT recipients that received TTP(KO) HPCs. Finally, the reconstitution of irradiated TTP(KO) recipient mice with TTP(ΔARE) HPCs did not confer any protection to the TTP(KO) mice. These data together suggest that non-HPCs-specific overexpression of TTP within the lungs protects against ALI via downregulation of neutrophil chemoattractants and reduction in neutrophilic infiltration.",2020-09-02,"Choudhary, Ishita; Vo, Thao; Bathula, Chandra S.; Lamichhane, Richa; Lewis, Brandon W.; Looper, Jayme; Jeyaseelan, Samithamby; Blackshear, Perry J.; Saini, Yogesh; Patial, Sonika",Front Immunol,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/10068cf0ade046b53ddece2135c039077fbca7d4.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7493631.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32983182/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.02164,221462028.0

One of the largest bottlenecks with the in-flight Internet is that the airplane is far away from both the satellites and the ground base stations during most of the flight time. Maintaining a reliable and high-rate wireless connection with the airplane over such a long-range link thus becomes a challenge. Microwave frequencies allow for long link distances but lack the data rate to serve up to several hundreds of potential onboard customers. Higher bands in the millimeter-wave spectrum (30 GHz-300 GHz) have, therefore, been utilized to overcome the bandwidth limitations. Still, the per-user throughput with state-of-the-art millimeter-wave systems is an order of magnitude lower than the one available with terrestrial wireless networks. In this paper, we take a step further and study the channel characteristics for the terahertz band (THz, 0.3 THz-10 THz) in order to map the feasibility of this band for aviation. We first propose a detailed channel model for aerial THz communications taking into account both the non-flat Earth geometry and the main features of the frequency-selective THz channel. We then apply this model to estimate the characteristics of aerial THz links in different conditions. We finally determine the altitudes where the use of airplane-to-satellite THz connection becomes preferable over the airplane-to-ground THz link. Our results reveal that the capacity of the airborne THz link may reach up to 120 Gbit/s, thus enabling cellular-equivalent data rates to the passengers and staff during the entire flight.",2020-09-29,"Kokkoniemi, J.; Jornet, J.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective observational study. Patients taking statins were 11 years older and had significantly more comorbidities than patients who were not taking statins. A genetic matching (GM) procedure was performed prior to analysis of the mortality risk. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for the cause-specific hazard (CSH) function, and a competing-risks Fine and Gray (FG) model was also used to study the direct effects of statins on risk. Data from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed 2157 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients (1234 men, 923 women; age: 67 y/o (IQR 54-78)) admitted to the hospital were retrieved from the clinical records in anonymized manner. 353 deaths occurred. 581 patients were taking statins. Univariate test after GM showed a significantly lower mortality rate in patients on statin therapy than the matched non-statin group (19.8% vs. 25.4%, χ(2) with Yates continuity correction: p = 0.027). The mortality rate was even lower in patients (n = 336) who maintained their statin treatments during hospitalization compared to the GM non-statin group (17.4%; p = 0.045). The Cox model applied to the CSH function (HR = 0.58(CI: 0.39-0.89); p = 0.01) and the competing risks FG model (HR = 0.60(CI: 0.39-0.92); p = 0.02) suggest that statins are associated with reduced COVID-19-related mortality.

METHODS Eight hospitals were selected in six provinces from a national acute respiratory infection surveillance network. Demographic information, clinical history and physical examination, and laboratory testing results of the enrolled hospitalized patients aged less than five years with pneumonia, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human influenza virus, adenoviruses (ADV), human parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronavirus (hCoV)and human bocavirus (hBoV) were analyzed. The viral etiology spectrum of the enrolled patients was analyzed by age-group, year, and seasonality of the detected viral etiologies were described. RESULTS 4 508 hospitalized children less than five years old, with pneumonia from 8 hospitals were included, and 2 688 (59.6%) patients were positive for at least one viral etiology. The most frequent detected virus was RSV (21.3%), followed by PIV (7.1%) and influenza (5.2%), hBoV (3.8%), ADV(3.6%) and hMPV(2.6%). The lowest positive rates in hCoV(1.1%). RSV, influenza, PIV, hBoV and hMPV all showed the nature of seasonality. CONCLUSION RSV was a most common viral etiology in the hospitalized young children less than 5 years of age with pneumonia.

Given that SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible, surgical societies have recommended that procedures with a high risk of aerosolization be avoided or delayed. However, some high-risk procedures, such as those related to head and neck malignancies, cannot always be delayed. Care must be taken during aerosol-generating procedures to minimize viral transmission as much as possible. Preoperative testing for COVID-19, limited operating room personnel, adequate personal protective equipment, and surgical technique are factors to consider for high-risk procedures. Methods: This article presents the case of an awake tracheotomy performed for a transglottic mass causing airway obstruction. Results: With detailed planning and specific techniques, the amount of aerosolization was reduced, and the procedure was performed as safely as possible.

k0qcmonr,nan,WHO,Rapamycin as a potential repurpose drug candidate for the treatment of COVID-19,nan,nan,nan,unk,"The novel human coronavirus-2 (HCoV-2), called SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of Coronavirus Induced Disease (COVID-19) and has spread causing a global pandemic. Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent infection nor any approved drug for the treatment. The development of a new drug is time-consuming and cannot be relied on as a solution in combatting the immediate global challenge. In such a situation, the drug repurposing becomes an attractive solution to identify the potential of COVID-19 treatment by existing drugs, which are approved for other indications. Here, we review the potential use of rapamycin, an mTOR (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin) inhibitor that can be repurposed at low dosages for the treatment of COVID-19. Rapamycin inhibits protein synthesis, delays aging, reduces obesity in animal models, and inhibits activities or expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-2, IL-6 and, IL-10. Overall, the use of rapamycin can help to control viral particle synthesis, cytokine storms and contributes to fight the disease by its anti-aging and anti-obesity effects. Since, rapamycin targets the host factors and not viral machinery, it represents a potent candidate for the treatment of COVID-19 than antiviral drugs as its efficacy is less likely to be dampened with high mutation rate of viral RNA. Additionally, the inhibitory effect of rapamycin on cell proliferation may aid in reducing viral replication. Therefore, by drug repurposing, low dosages of rapamycin can be tested for the potential treatment of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 infection.",2020,"Husain, Amjad; Byrareddy, Siddappa N",Chem Biol Interact,nan,#816316,nan,nan,nan,nan,222136622.0

Developing and evaluating rapid and easy-to-perform diagnostic tests is an absolute priority. The current study was designed to assess diagnostic performances of an antigen-based rapid detection test (COVID-VIRO(R)) in a real-life setting. MethodsTwo nasopharyngeal specimens of symptomatic or asymptomatic adult patients hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Department or voluntarily accessing the COVID-19 Screening Department of the Regional Hospital of Orleans, France, were concurrently collected. COVID VIRO(R) diagnostic specificity and sensitivity were assessed in comparison to real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results. A subset of patients underwent an additional oropharyngeal and/or a saliva swab for rapid testing. Results121 patients already having a confirmed infection and 127 patients having no evidence of recent or ongoing infection were enrolled, for a total of 248 couple of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Overall COVID-VIRO(R) sensitivity was 96.7% (IC: 93.5%-99.9%). In asymptomatic patients, symptomatic patients having symptoms for more than 4 days and those having a RT-qPCR Cycle threshold value [â¥]32, sensitivity was of 100%, 95.8% and 91.9% respectively.

We aimed to assess characteristics of journal articles, preprint articles, and registered trial protocols about COVID-19 and its causal agent SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We analyzed characteristics of journal articles with original data indexed by March 19, 2020, in World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 collection, articles published on preprint servers medRxiv and bioRxiv by April 3, 2010. Additionally, we assessed characteristics of clinical trials indexed in the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) by April 7, 2020. RESULTS: Among the first 2118 articles on COVID-19 published in scholarly journals, 533 (25%) contained original data. The majority was published by authors from China (75%) and funded by Chinese sponsors (75%); a quarter was published in the Chinese language. Among 312 articles that self-reported study design, the most frequent were retrospective studies (N = 88; 28%) and case reports (N = 86; 28%), analyzing patients' characteristics (38%). Median Journal Impact Factor of journals where articles were published was 5.099. Among 1088 analyzed preprint articles, the majority came from authors affiliated in China (51%) and were funded by sources in China (46%). Less than half reported study design; the majority were modeling studies (62%), and analyzed transmission/risk/prevalence (43%). Of the 927 analyzed registered trials, the majority were interventional (58%). Half were already recruiting participants. The location for the conduct of the trial in the majority was China (N = 522; 63%). The median number of planned participants was 140 (range: 1 to 15,000,000). Registered intervention trials used highly heterogeneous primary outcomes and tested highly heterogeneous interventions; the most frequently studied interventions were hydroxychloroquine (N = 39; 7.2%) and chloroquine (N = 16; 3%). CONCLUSIONS: Early articles on COVID-19 were predominantly retrospective case reports and modeling studies. The diversity of outcomes used in intervention trial protocols indicates the urgent need for defining a core outcome set for COVID-19 research.

In the present study, a series of Computed Tomography (CT) scan images of the nasal cavities from ten healthy subjects were collected and used to reconstruct accurate 3D models. All models were divided into twelve anatomical regions in order to study the transport and deposition features of different regions of the nasal cavity with specific functions. The flow field and micro-particle transport equations were solved, and the total and regional particle deposition fractions were evaluated for the rest and low activity breathing conditions.

The model accounts for stochastic interaction between bacteria and cells of the immune system and heterogeneity in susceptibility to infection of individual hosts within a population.

The model is thereafter parametrized with respect to the highly virulent Schu S4 strain of Francisella tularensis, in the first such study to consider a biologically plausible mathematical model for early human infection with this bacterium. Results indicate a median infectious dose of about 23 organisms, which is higher than previously thought, and an average incubation period of between 3 and 7 days depending on dose. The distribution of incubation periods is right-skewed up to about 100 organisms and symmetric for larger doses. Moreover, there are some interesting parallels to the hypotheses of some of the classical dose–response models, such as independent action (single-hit model) and individual effective dose (probit model).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate imaging characteristics and artifact production of polymeric coils compared with standard platinum coils in vitro and in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS Polymeric coils and standard platinum coils were evaluated in vitro with the use of 2 identical silicon aneurysm models coiled with a packing attenuation of 20% each. DSA, flat panel CT, CT, and MR imaging were performed. In vivo evaluation of imaging characteristics of polymeric coils was performed in experimentally created rabbit carotid bifurcation aneurysms. DSA, CT/CTA, and MR imaging were performed after endovascular treatment of the aneurysms. Images were evaluated regarding visibility of individual coils, coil mass, artifact production, and visibility of residual flow within the aneurysm. RESULTS Overall, in vitro and in vivo imaging showed relevantly reduced artifact production of polymeric coils in all imaging modalities compared with standard platinum coils. Image quality of CT and MR imaging was improved with the use of polymeric coils, which permitted enhanced depiction of individual coil loops and residual aneurysm lumen as well as the peri-aneurysmal area. Remarkably, CT images demonstrated considerably improved image quality with only minor artifacts compared with standard coils. On DSA, polymeric coils showed transparency and allowed visualization of superimposed vessel structures. CONCLUSIONS This initial experimental study showed improved imaging quality with the use of polymeric coils compared with standard platinum coils in all imaging modalities.

In continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) literature, however, culture-negative peritoneal inflammation is referred to as ""sterile"" or ""chemical"" peritonitis. These terms not only imply unwarranted etiologic assumptions, but may also deflect attention from the existence of medical conditions to which the peritoneum is subject. This is evident in CAPD literature where there is little recognition that the peritoneum, as a member of the serosa and a secretor of lamellar bodies, is prey to a wide range of disorders. Thus before, during, and after CAPD, the membrane is liable to fall victim to disease states unconnected with the process of dialysis. Significant peritoneal pathology occurs as part of a pan-serositis, which may be metabolic (uremia, cholesterolosis), autoimmune (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid disease, acute rheumatism, endocrinopathies), genetic (recurrent hereditary polyserositis), allergic (eosinophilic serositis), and granulomatous in nature.

The UTRs are identical to those in the viral genome, since the 2.2-kb DI RNA is composed of only the two ends of the genome fused between an internal site within the 738-nucleotide (nt) 5'-most coding region (the nsp1, or p28, coding region) and a site just 4 nt upstream of the 3'-most open reading frame (ORF) (the N gene). The joined ends of the viral genome in the DI RNA create a single continuous 1,635-nt ORF, 288 nt of which come from the 738-nt nsp1 coding region. Here, we have analyzed features of the 5'-terminal 288-nt portion of the nsp1 coding region within the continuous ORF that are required for DI RNA replication. We observed that (i) the 5'-terminal 186 nt of the nsp1 coding region are necessary and sufficient for DI RNA replication, (ii) two Mfold-predicted stem-loops within the 186-nt sequence, named SLV (nt 239 to 310) and SLVI (nt 311 to 340), are supported by RNase structure probing and by nucleotide covariation among closely related group 2 coronaviruses, and (iii) SLVI is a required higher-order structure for DI RNA replication based on mutation analyses. The function of SLV has not been evaluated. We conclude that SLVI within the BCoV nsp1 coding region is a higher-order cis-replication element for DI RNA and postulate that it functions similarly in the viral genome.",2007,"Brown, Cary G; Nixon, Kimberley S; Senanayake, Savithra D; Brian, David A",Journal of virology,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17475638/,28802900.0

4qyzg1lz,nan,WHO,Protocol for a qualitative study to identify strategies to optimise hospital ePrescribing systems,nan,nan,nan,unk,"INTRODUCTION: Electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) is a key area of development and investment in the UK and across the developed world. ePrescribing is widely understood as a vehicle for tackling medication-related safety concerns, improving care quality and making more efficient use of health resources. Nevertheless, implementation of an electronic health record does not itself ensure benefits for prescribing are maximised. We examine the process of optimisation of ePrescribing systems using case studies to provide policy recommendations based on the experiences of digitally mature hospital sites. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Qualitative interviews within six digitally mature sites will be carried out. The aim is to capture successful optimisation of electronic prescribing (ePrescribing) in particular health systems and hospitals. We have identified hospital sites in the UK and in three other developed countries. We used a combination of literature reviews and advice from experts at Optimising ePrescribing in Hospitals (eP Opt) Project round-table events. Sites were purposively selected based on geographical area, innovative work in ePrescribing/electronic health (eHealth) and potential transferability of practices to the UK setting. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed and transcripts coded thematically using NVivo software. Relevant policy and governance documents will be analysed, where available. Planned site visits were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Usher Research Ethics Group granted approval for this study. Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journals in medical informatics and expert round-table events, lay member meetings and the ePrescribing Toolkit (http://www.eprescribingtoolkit.com/)-an online resource supporting National Health Service (NHS) hospitals through the ePrescribing process.",2021,"Heeney, Catherine; Malden, Stephen; Sheikh, Aziz",BMJ Open,nan,#1028790,nan,nan,nan,nan,231605555.0

Increasing human-animal interactions are perceived as driving factors in pathogen transfer, emphasising the close relationships between human, animal and environmental health. Contemporary livelihood and market patterns tend to degrade ecosystems and their services, driving a cycle of degradation in increasingly tightly linked socio-ecological systems. This contributes to reductions in the natural regulating capacities of ecosystem services to limit disease transfer from animals to humans. It also undermines natural resource availability, compromising measures such as washing and sanitation that may be key to managing subsequent human-to-human disease transmission. Human activities driving this degrading cycle tend to convert beneficial ecosystem service into disservices, exacerbating risks related to zoonotic diseases. Conversely, measures to protect or restore ecosystems constitute investment in foundational capital, enhancing their capacities to provide for greater human security and opportunity. We use the DPSIR (Drivers-Pressures-State change-Impact-Response) framework to explore three aspects of zoonotic diseases: (1) the significance of disease regulation ecosystem services and their degradation in the emergence of Covid-19 and other zoonotic diseases, and of the protection of natural resources as mitigating contributions to both; (2) regulating human-to-human disease transfer; and (3) treatment of disease outbreaks. From this analysis, we identify a set of appropriate response options, recognising the foundational roles of ecosystems and the services they provide in risk management. Zoonotic disease risks are ultimately interlinked with biodiversity crises and water insecurity. The need to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic ongoing at the time of writing creates an opportunity for systemic policy change, placing scientific knowledge of the value and services of ecosystems at the heart of societal concerns as a key foundation for a more secure future. Rapid political responses and unprecedented economic stimuli reacting to the pandemic demonstrate that systemic change is achievable at scale and pace, and is also therefore transferrable to other existential, global-scale threats including climate change and the ‘biodiversity crisis’. This also highlights the need for concerted global action, and is also consistent with the duties, and ultimately the self-interests, of developed, donor nations.",2020-05-26,"Everard, Mark; Johnston, Paul; Santillo, David; Staddon, Chad",Environ Sci Policy,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/3d5bd4fe58bc624b2cc4faac4b9003374fb31d8b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7247996.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32501392/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1462901120306122; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901120306122?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2020.05.017,218871875.0

TBI patients suffer short- and long-term behavioral, cognitive, and emotional impairments, including difficulties in concentration, memory loss, and depression. Research shows that CE application can mitigate cognitive and behavioral impairments in animal models for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, whose pathophysiology is similar to that of TBI. This study builds on prior research by showing similar results in TBI mice models. After drinking CE for a week, mice were injured using our 70-g weight drop TBI device. For 2 weeks thereafter, the mice continued drinking CE alongside standard lab nutrition. Subsequently, the mice underwent behavioral tests to assess their memory, motor activity, and anxiety. The mice brains were harvested for immunohistochemistry staining to evaluate overall neuronal survival. Our results show that CE consumption almost completely mitigates memory impairment and decreases neuronal loss after TBI. Mice that did not consume CE demonstrated impaired memory. Our results also show that CE consumption attenuated neuronal loss in the temporal cortex and the dentate gyrus. Mice that did not consume CE suffered a significant neuronal loss. There were no significant differences in anxiety levels and motor activity between all groups.

Understanding patients’ hematologic findings in SARS-CoV-2 infection is essential to doing their prognosis, so adjusting care and improving outcomes. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we aim at summarizing changes in the hematopoietic system and hemostasis that occur in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. FINDINGS: COVID-19 infection is often associated with laboratory hematologic features that can have important clinical implications. Careful revision of baseline hematologic data at diagnosis can predict the severity of illness and help clinicians tailoring the approach and management of patients whose condition can be guarded or critical. The levels of hematologic markers like D-dimer, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, viral load, inflammatory cytokines, differential blood cell count, and peripheral smear are fundamental for the prognosis. Studies have also shown an association between some of these markers and severe COVID-19 infection requiring admission to the intensive care unit or complicated by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since, so far, a vaccine is not available, prevention of the infection is based on the avoiding people affected and the spreading of the virus; the treatment, in the absence of an effective antiviral agent, is symptomatic, and, in addition to oxygen support, finds in the anti-inflammatory drugs and anticoagulation fundamental therapeutic lines.

Case reports of hospitalized patients suggest that COVID-19 prominently affects the cardiovascular system, but the overall impact remains unknown. Objective: To evaluate the presence of myocardial injury in unselected patients recently recovered from COVID-19 illness. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this prospective observational cohort study, 100 patients recently recovered from COVID-19 illness were identified from the University Hospital Frankfurt COVID-19 Registry between April and June 2020. Exposure: Recent recovery from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, as determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction on swab test of the upper respiratory tract. Main Outcomes and Measures: Demographic characteristics, cardiac blood markers, and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging were obtained. Comparisons were made with age-matched and sex-matched control groups of healthy volunteers (n = 50) and risk factor-matched patients (n = 57). Results: Of the 100 included patients, 53 (53%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 49 (14) years. The median (IQR) time interval between COVID-19 diagnosis and CMR was 71 (64-92) days. Of the 100 patients recently recovered from COVID-19, 67 (67%) recovered at home, while 33 (33%) required hospitalization. At the time of CMR, high-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) was detectable (greater than 3 pg/mL) in 71 patients recently recovered from COVID-19 (71%) and significantly elevated (greater than 13.9 pg/mL) in 5 patients (5%). Compared with healthy controls and risk factor-matched controls, patients recently recovered from COVID-19 had lower left ventricular ejection fraction, higher left ventricle volumes, and raised native T1 and T2. A total of 78 patients recently recovered from COVID-19 (78%) had abnormal CMR findings, including raised myocardial native T1 (n = 73), raised myocardial native T2 (n = 60), myocardial late gadolinium enhancement (n = 32), or pericardial enhancement (n = 22). There was a small but significant difference between patients who recovered at home vs in the hospital for native T1 mapping (median [IQR], 1119 [1092-1150] ms vs 1141 [1121-1175] ms; P = .008) and hsTnT (4.2 [3.0-5.9] pg/dL vs 6.3 [3.4-7.9] pg/dL; P = .002) but not for native T2 mapping. None of these measures were correlated with time from COVID-19 diagnosis (native T1: r = 0.07; P = .47; native T2: r = 0.14; P = .15; hsTnT: r = -0.07; P = .50). High-sensitivity troponin T was significantly correlated with native T1 mapping (r = 0.33; P < .001) and native T2 mapping (r = 0.18; P = .01). Endomyocardial biopsy in patients with severe findings revealed active lymphocytic inflammation. Native T1 and T2 were the measures with the best discriminatory ability to detect COVID-19-related myocardial pathology. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of a cohort of German patients recently recovered from COVID-19 infection, CMR revealed cardiac involvement in 78 patients (78%) and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60 patients (60%), independent of preexisting conditions, severity and overall course of the acute illness, and time from the original diagnosis.

This study was to determine whether the damage was correlated with expression of the SARS coronavirus receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), in different organs, especially in the endocrine tissues of the pancreas, and to elucidate the pathogenesis of glucose intolerance in SARS patients. The effect of clinical variables on survival was estimated in 135 SARS patients who died, 385 hospitalized SARS patients who survived, and 19 patients with non-SARS pneumonia. A total of 39 SARS patients who had no previous diabetes and received no steroid treatment were compared to 39 matched healthy siblings during a 3-year follow-up period. The pattern of SARS coronavirus receptor-ACE2 proteins in different human organs was also studied. Significant elevations in oxygen saturation, serum creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase MB isoenzyme, and fasting plasma glucose (FPG), but not in alanine transaminase were predictors for death. Abundant ACE2 immunostaining was found in lung, kidney, heart, and islets of pancreas, but not in hepatocytes. Twenty of the 39 followed-up patients were diabetic during hospitalization. After 3 years, only two of these patients had diabetes. Compared with their non-SARS siblings, these patients exhibited no significant differences in FPG, postprandial glucose (PPG), and insulin levels.

Understanding what the public knows about COVID-19 and identifying beliefs based on misinformation can help shape effective public health communications to ensure efforts to reduce viral transmission are not undermined. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with COVID-19 misinformation in Australia and their changes over time. METHODS: This prospective, longitudinal national survey was completed by adults (18 years and above) across April (n=4362), May (n=1882), and June (n=1369) 2020. RESULTS: Stronger agreement with misinformation was associated with younger age, male gender, lower education level, and language other than English spoken at home (P<.01 for all). After controlling for these variables, misinformation beliefs were significantly associated (P<.001) with lower levels of digital health literacy, perceived threat of COVID-19, confidence in government, and trust in scientific institutions. Analyses of specific government-identified misinformation revealed 3 clusters: prevention (associated with male gender and younger age), causation (associated with lower education level and greater social disadvantage), and cure (associated with younger age).

We note that bidirectional causal relationships exist in several sub-periods using sub-sample rolling window test. Our analysis confirms the option-based model (Foster & Van Order, 1984) that proves the falling house price leads to more defaults of mortgage and increasing credit risk. Meanwhile, the rise in credit risk is likely to be accompanied by the increasing house price. Rising house price has no impact on credit risk. We find banks' credit expansion may be irrational which leads to the accumulation of credit risk. The tight credit policies and high loan interest rates stimulate the house price to fall. In addition, based on the analysis of the previous periods, we do not think that the credit risk will explode systematically in China with the current situation of mortgage growth slowing down. However, due to the pivotal role of real estate credit in loan structure of banks in China, we still need to be alert to the potential accumulation credit risk caused by the default of individuals and enterprises. It is essential for banks to strengthen the examination of personal credit certificates to prevent speculative loans.

Herein is a discussion of our experience gained from the initial 130 patients enrolled in transgastric pre-NOTES and NOTES protocols at our institution. METHODS A retrospective review of our research database was performed for all patients enrolled in NOTES protocols. The infectious risk of a gastrotomy with and without a NOTES procedure was assessed in 100 patients. Eighty patients completed a true NOTES protocol looking at staging, access, and insufflation with select patients evaluating the potential for bacterial contamination of the abdominal compartment. RESULTS A total of 130 patients have completed pre-NOTES and NOTES protocols at our institution. We observed no clinically significant contamination of the abdomen secondary to transgastric procedures in 100 patients. Diagnostic transgastric endoscopic peritoneoscopy (DTEP) was completed in 20 patients with pancreatic head masses and found to have a 95% concordance with laparoscopic exploration for assessment of peritoneal metastases. Blind endoscopic gastrotomy and DTEP were evaluated in 40 patients who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedures (LSRYGB) and were found to be safe, reliable, and without a clinically significant risk of contamination. Endoscopic peritoneal insufflation was successfully established and correlated with standard laparoscopic insufflation in 20 patients. CONCLUSIONS Transgastric NOTES is a safe alternative approach to accessing the peritoneal cavity in humans. The risk of bacterial contamination secondary to peroral and transgastric access is clinically insignificant. A device for the facile closure of the gastric defect is the sole factor limiting institution of this methodology as a standalone technique.",2011,"Nau, Peter; Ellison, E Christopher; Muscarella, Peter; Mikami, Dean; Narula, Vimal K; Needleman, Bradley; Melvin, W Scott; Hazey, Jeffrey W",Surgical endoscopy,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1369-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20976500/,12770474.0
rj8wudln,nan,Medline,Relational Modeling for Robust and Efficient Pulmonary Lobe Segmentation in CT Scans.,nan,nan,32550251.0,unk,"Pulmonary lobe segmentation in computed tomography scans is essential for regional assessment of pulmonary diseases. Recent works based on convolution neural networks have achieved good performance for this task. However, they are still limited in capturing structured relationships due to the nature of convolution. The shape of the pulmonary lobes affect each other and their borders relate to the appearance of other structures, such as vessels, airways, and the pleural wall. We argue that such structural relationships play a critical role in the accurate delineation of pulmonary lobes when the lungs are affected by diseases such as COVID-19 or COPD. In this paper, we propose a relational approach (RTSU-Net) that leverages structured relationships by introducing a novel non-local neural network module. The proposed module learns both visual and geometric relationships among all convolution features to produce self-attention weights. With a limited amount of training data available from COVID-19 subjects, we initially train and validate RTSU-Net on a cohort of 5000 subjects from the COPDGene study (4000 for training and 1000 for evaluation). Using models pre-trained on COPDGene, we apply transfer learning to retrain and evaluate RTSU-Net on 470 COVID-19 suspects (370 for retraining and 100 for evaluation). Experimental results show that RTSU-Net outperforms three baselines and performs robustly on cases with severe lung infection due to COVID-19.",2020-04-16,"Xie, Weiyi; Jacobs, Colin; Charbonnier, Jean-Paul; van Ginneken, Bram",ArXiv,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32550251/,218571368.0

Healthcare workers (HCWs) are an important target group for vaccination against influenza due to their increased risk of infection and their potential to transmit the infection to their patients, families and communities. The aim of this study was to assess the potential hesitancy and its associated factors towards influenza vaccination amongst HCWs in the South Al Batinah governorate in Oman. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of 390 HCWs with direct or indirect patient contact was conducted in May and June 2019 using a self-administered questionnaire. Associations between HCW characteristics and vaccination status were examined using bivariate and multivariate analyses to identify the likelihood of vaccination against seasonal influenza among HCWs. Results: Overall, 60% of HCWs were vaccinated in the 2018/2019 season; vaccine uptake among nurses was 52% and uptake was higher among women. Self-protection and protection of the community were the most cited reasons for vaccine acceptance, with side effects being the main reason for hesitancy. Vaccinated respondents had a higher mean knowledge score (7.18; standard deviation SD: 2.14) than unvaccinated respondents (6.30; SD: 2.2). Odds of vaccination were highest among respondents who believed influenza vaccine should be mandatory for HCWs (Odds ratio (OR): 2.04 [1.30–3.18]), those working in the general medicine, emergency medicine, or intensive care units (OR: 1.92 [1.20–3.10]), nurses and doctors (OR: 1.75 [1.09–2.79]) and those who believe that HCWs should receive an influenza vaccine (OR: 1.35 [1.07–2.77]).

Free vascularized fibular (FVF) flaps have been used successfully in the treatment of segmental bone defects; however, their efficacy in the treatment of radiated nonunions is limited. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the outcome following FVFG for radiation-associated femoral fracture nonunions. METHODS: 23 (11 male and 12 female; mean age 60â¯±â¯12 years) patients underwent FVF for radiation-associated femoral fracture nonunions. The most common indication for radiotherapy was soft tissue sarcomas (nâ¯=â¯16). The mean follow-up was 5â¯±â¯4 years. Mean radiation dose was 51â¯±â¯14â¯Gy at a mean of 11â¯±â¯3 years prior to FVF. The mean FVF length was 17â¯±â¯4â¯cm and placed commonly with an intramedullary nail (nâ¯=â¯18). RESULTS: First time union was 52% (nâ¯=â¯12) following additional bone grafting, the overall union was 78% (nâ¯=â¯18) at a mean of 13â¯±â¯6 months. Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scores improved from 30% preoperatively to 73% at latest follow-up (pâ¯<â¯0.0001). Five fractures failed to unite; 3 were converted to proximal femoral replacements.

AIM: The aim of this study was to assess if guideline driven antimicrobial prescribing for CAP can be improved using an intervention bundle. Secondary measures assessed were length of stay (LOS), mortality, duration of intravenous antibiotics and total antibiotic duration, improving uptake of appropriate investigations and documentation of CURB65. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of hospitalised CAP patients from August -September 2018 was compared with a post intervention prospective cohort from May-June 2019. Intervention bundle included a mobile audience response session (MARS) session, promotion of the antimicrobial app, development of a physical card with local guidelines and incorporating CURB65 into the unscheduled admission proforma. Local guidelines are in keeping with the British Thoracic Society (BTS) CAP guidelines. RESULTS: 69 adult patients (>18 years old) were included in the study (37 retrospective, 32 prospective). Overall compliance with local CAP guidelines improved from 21% to 62.5% (p < 0.001). No difference in initial intravenous antibiotic duration was seen, median 4 vs 4 days (p = 0.73), total antibiotic duration was significantly shorter in the post intervention group, median 9 vs 7 days (p = 0.01). No difference in length of stay or mortality was seen between the groups. Documentation of CURB65 improved from 5.6% to 46.9% (p < 0.01).

More than 60 VOCs were determined from 850 samples collected from four sites in and around the complexes through a 2-year monitoring campaign from 2005 to 2007. The VOCs of particular concern found in the area were benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, trichloroethylene, and formaldehyde, given their toxicity, concentration, and detection frequency. Toluene was the most abundant one. The VOC concentration rankings were consistent with their emission rankings. Most VOCs had higher concentrations at the industrial sites than at residential sites, indicating a significant impact of industrial emissions. The ambient levels of benzene and formaldehyde were additionally affected by vehicular emissions and secondary formation, respectively. Overall, the VOC levels increased in winter and at night, because of the local weather conditions. In contrast, the formaldehyde concentration increased in summer, owing to its secondary formation in the atmosphere. The ambient VOC levels in Sihwa-Banwol were higher than those in other parts of Korea. Additionally, the cumulative cancer risks posed by the toxic VOCs exceeded a tolerable risk level of 1 × 10-4 in not only the industrial areas but also the residential areas. The sum of the non-cancer risks in both areas significantly exceeded the threshold criterion of 1. The large amounts of aromatic compounds emitted from the industrial complexes are believed to play a crucial role in the elevated levels of surface ozone in the Seoul metropolitan area during the summer season. Therefore, comprehensive measures for controlling the VOC emissions in the Sihwa-Banwol area need to be prioritized to reduce the health risks for residents of not only this area but also the capital Seoul and its surrounding areas.",2020,"Kim, Min-Ji; Seo, Young-Kyo; Kim, Jong-Ho; Baek, Sung-Ok",nan,nan,#32418108,nan,nan,nan,nan,218657536.0

Wide surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are the most common sarcoma treatments. However, sarcomas' response rates to chemotherapy are quite low and sarcoma cells can have intrinsic or acquired resistance after treatment with chemotherapeutics drugs, leading to the development of multi-drug resistance (MDR). Cancer cellular plasticity plays pivotal roles in cancer initiation, progression, therapy resistance and cancer relapse. Moreover, cancer cellular plasticity can be regulated by a multitude of factors, such as genetic and epigenetic alterations, tumor microenvironment (TME) or selective pressure imposed by treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated that cellular plasticity is involved in sarcoma progression and chemoresistance. It's essential to understand the molecular mechanisms of cellular plasticity as well as its roles in sarcoma progression and drug resistance.

METHODS: The Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework was used to evaluate telehealth physical therapy implementation. Patient-level data were extracted from electronic medical records between the dates of March 16 and May 16, 2020 (implementation phase). Reach was defined as the proportion of physical therapy sessions completed via telehealth. Effectiveness was assessed using a patient-reported satisfaction survey with a 5-point Likert scale. Adoption was defined as the proportion of physical therapists who used telehealth. Implementation was assessed through qualitative analysis of patient and clinician perspectives to identify emergent themes, retrospectively classify strategies used during the implementation phase, and prospectively identify evidence-based strategies to increase telehealth maintenance and scale-up. Maintenance of telehealth was defined as the proportion of patients who indicated they would attend another telehealth session. RESULTS: There were 4548 physical therapy sessions provided by 40 therapists from date to date, of which 3883 (85%) were telehealth. Ninety-four percent of patients were satisfied. All physical therapists (100%) used telehealth technology at least once. Retrospectively classified and prospectively identified evidence-based strategies were organized into five qualitative themes that supported implementation: organizational factors (policies, pre-existing partnerships), engaging external stakeholders (satisfaction survey), champions (clinician leaders), clinician education (dynamic, ongoing training), and process (promote adaptability, small tests of change). Ninety-two percent of patients reported they would attend another telehealth session.

Due to the timeframe involved, these patients may have developed humoral immunity to SARS-CoV-2 while still testing positive for viral RNA in swabs. Data are lacking on exposure risks in these situations. Here, we studied SARS-CoV-2 environmental contamination in an ICU and an isolation ward caring for such COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We collected air and surface samples in a hospital caring for critical and severe COVID-19 cases from common areas and areas proximal to patients. RESULTS: Of the 218 ICU samples, an air sample contained SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Of the 182 isolation ward samples, nine contained SARS-CoV-2 RNA. These were collected from a facemask, the floor, mobile phones, and the air in the patient room and bathroom. Serum antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in these patients at the beginning of the study. CONCLUSIONS: While there is a perception of increased risk in the ICU, our study demonstrates that isolation wards may pose greater risks to healthcare workers and exposure risks remain with clinically improved patients, weeks after their initial diagnoses.

We hypothesized based on prior observations in ischemic stroke patients, that there would be significant decline in critically ill neurologic patients presenting to hospitals during the pandemic which may impact outcomes. METHODS: We used TriNetX, a large research network, collecting real-time electronic medical records data. We extracted data on utilization of critical care and hospital inpatient services among cohorts of patients with common neurocritical conditions between January-June 2020 compared to similar time-frame in previous years. We also compared the prevalence and clinical outcomes comprising need for intubation and 30-day mortality among these cohorts. RESULTS: We found a 28.1% reduction in intensive care unit (ICU) admissions with critical neurologic illnesses in 2020 when compared to 2019 (8568 vs. 11917 patients, p<0.0001) and a 34.4% reduction compared to 2018 (8568 vs. 13064 patients, p<0.0001). However, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality (2020: 12.2 vs. 2019: 12.4% ; p=0.7; vs. 2018: 12.6%; p=0.62) or intubation rates across the years among patients using critical care services. There was 1% increase in mortality among non-ICU patients with similar diagnoses in 2020 compared to previous years (2020: 3.9% vs. 2019: 2.9% vs. 2018: 3.1%; p<0.0001, p=0.0001), but no difference in intubation rates. CONCLUSION: There was a significant reduction in hospital and ICU admissions among patients with acute neurologic emergencies in 2020, after onset of COVID-19 pandemic, compared to previous years. While we did not find a significant difference in mortality among patients admitted to the ICU, there was slightly higher mortality among non-ICU patients with same diagnoses in 2020 compared to previous years.

7y891ev0,nan,WHO,Cloroquine and hydroxychloroquine: The Yin-yang of these drugs from a theoretical study,nan,nan,nan,unk,"On November 12, 2019 the first case of infection of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified at Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China. Regardless of the origin of this virus, which is uncertain, it has produced a pandemic that has been the cause of human deaths worldwide. Two drugs are being used as antiviral against this virus; cloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, although controversy exists concerning their effectiveness. The main objective of this report is to present the electronic properties of cloroquine and hydroxychloroquine that might help explain the action mechanisms against virus. The idea that emerges from this study is that acid-base equilibrium is not the only criteria of importance to explain the action mechanism, but that the oxide-reduction balance may also help explain the toxicity or effectiveness of these drugs. Being molecules able to oxidize other molecules is similar to yin-yang; a dualism that describes contrary forces, as oxidation may produce dysfunction and affect the conditions needed for viral infection, replication and propagation of the virus, but also contribute to increasing oxidative stress.

While microsurgical clipping and advances in endovascular techniques have improved overall efficacy in achieving complete occlusion, recurrences still occur, and the best modality for retreatment remains controversial. Despite its efficacy in this setting, the role of PED utilization in the setting of recurrent aneurysms has not yet been well defined. This study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of PED in the recurrence of previously treated aneurysms. METHODS The authors reviewed a total of 13 cases in which patients underwent secondary placement of a PED for aneurysm recurrence following prior treatment with another modality. The PEDs were used to treat aneurysm recurrence or residual following endovascular coiling in 7 cases, flow diversion in 2, and microsurgical clipping in 4. The mean time between initial treatment and retreatment with a PED was 28.1 months, 12 months, and 88.7 months, respectively. Clinical outcomes, including complications and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, and angiographic evidence of complete occlusion were tabulated for each treatment group. RESULTS All PEDs were successfully placed without periprocedural complications. The rate of complete occlusion was 80% at 6 months after PED placement and 100% at 12 months in these patients who underwent PED placement following failed endovascular coiling; there were no adverse clinical sequelae at a mean follow-up of 26.1 months. In the 2 cases in which PEDs were placed for treatment of residual aneurysms following prior flow diversion, 1 patient demonstrated asymptomatic vessel occlusion at 6 months, and the other exhibited complete aneurysm occlusion at 12 months. In patients with aneurysm recurrence following prior microsurgical clipping, the rate of complete occlusion was 100% at 6 and 12 months, with no adverse sequelae noted at a mean clinical follow-up of 27.7 months. CONCLUSIONS The treatment of recurrent aneurysms with the PED following previous endovascular coiling, flow diversion, or microsurgical clipping is associated with a high rate of complete occlusion and minimal morbidity.",2017,"Dornbos, David; Karras, Constantine L; Wenger, Nicole; Priddy, Blake; Youssef, Patrick; Nimjee, Shahid M; Powers, Ciarán J",Neurosurgical focus,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.3171/2017.3.focus1744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28565989/,4826804.0

We describe quantitative trait analysis of plant height and flowering time in the naturally occurring tetraploid Sorghum halepense, using two novel BC1F2 populations totaling 246 genotypes derived from backcrossing two tetraploid Sorghum bicolor x S. halepense F1 plants to a tetraploidized S. bicolor. Phenotyping for two years each in Bogart, GA and Salina, KS allowed us to dissect variance into narrow-sense genetic (QTLs) and environmental components. In crosses with a common S. bicolor BTx623 parent, comparison of QTLs in S. halepense, its rhizomatous progenitor S. propinquum and S. bicolor race guinea which is highly divergent from BTx623 permit inferences of loci at which new alleles have been associated with improvement of elite sorghums. The relative abundance of QTLs unique to the S. halepense populations may reflect its polyploidy and subsequent 'diploidization' processes often associated with the formation of genetic novelty, a possibility further supported by a high level of QTL polymorphism within sibling lines derived from a common S. halepense parent. An intriguing hypothesis for further investigation is that polyploidy of S. halepense following 96 million years of abstinence, coupled with natural selection during its spread to diverse environments across six continents, may provide a rich collection of novel alleles that offer potential opportunities for sorghum improvement.",2021,"Kong, WenQian; Nabukalu, Pheonah; Cox, T S; Goff, Valorie H; Robertson, Jon S; Pierce, Gary J; Lemke, Cornelia; Compton, Rosana; Paterson, Andrew H",Theor. appl. genet,nan,#33423085,nan,nan,nan,nan,231577146.0

SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe cases involves the host response as an important contributor to the disease process and tissue damage, mainly due to dysregulated and excessive innate immune responses. The primary immune response leads to viral clearance in the majority of cases. However, in a subgroup of patients, the secondary immune response may be exaggerated, leading to inflammatory-induced lung injury and other complications including pneumonitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory failure, shock, organ failure, and potentially death.

To implement prevention strategies it is important to gain information on management and to point out risk factors. The objective of this internet based survey was to describe calf management practices on registered dairy breeding farms in Austria and to estimate differences in calf disease incidences depending on farm structure and management practices. RESULTS: A total of 1287 questionnaires were finally analysed (response rate 12.2 %). Herd characteristics and regional distribution of farms indicated that this survey gives a good overview on calf management practices on registered dairy farms in Austria. The median number of cows per farm was 20 (interquartile range 13–30). Significant differences regarding farm characteristics and calf management between small and large farms (≤20 vs >20 cows) were present. Only 2.8 % of farmers tested first colostrum quality by use of a hydrometer. Storing frozen colostrum was more prevalent on large farms (80.8 vs 64.2 %). On 85.1 % of the farms, whole milk, including waste milk, was fed to the calves. Milk replacer and waste milk were more often used on large farms. In accordance with similar studies from other countries, calf diarrhoea was indicated as the most prevalent disease. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that herd size was associated with calf diarrhoea and calf respiratory tract disease, with higher risk of disease on large farms. Furthermore, feeding waste milk to the calves was associated with increasing calf diarrhoea incidence on farm. In the final model with calf respiratory tract disease as outcome, respondents from organic farms reported less often a respiratory tract disease incidence of over 10 % compared with conventional farms [odds ratio (OR) 0.40, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.21–0.75] and farmers that housed calves individually or in groups after birth significantly reported more often to have an incidence of respiratory tract disease >10 % compared with farms where all calves were housed individually (OR 2.28, 95 % CI 1.16–4.48). CONCLUSION: The results obtained in this study provide an overview on calf management on dairy breeding farms in Austria and may help to further point out areas to be improved on farm.

This study investigated the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis on Italian residents during the first week of government-imposed lockdown and the role of defense mechanisms as protective factors against distress. In this cross-sectional study, 5,683 Italians responded to an online survey assessing socio-demographics, overall psychological distress, post-traumatic symptoms, and defense mechanisms using validated measures as the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Defense Mechanisms Rating Scale-Self-Report-30 (DMRS-SR-30). Data were collected from March 13 to March 18, within the first week of lockdown in Italy. Results showed that younger age and female gender were associated with increased psychological distress. Having positive cases nearby, more days on lockdown, and having to relocate were also associated with greater distress. Higher overall defensive functioning (ODF) was associated with lower levels of depression (r = −.44, 95% CI −0.48, −0.40), anxiety (r = −.38, 95% CI −0.42, −0.35), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (r = −.34, 95% CI −0.38, −0.30).

But there are few comparative studies on the differences between imported and local patients which may provide information of the different courses of the virus after transmission. METHODS: We investigated 169 cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in two centers in Hunan Province, and divided them into two groups according to epidemiological history, ""imported patients"" refers to patient with a clear history of travel in Wuhan within 14 days before onset, and "" local patients” refers to local resident without a recent history of travel in Wuhan, aiming to analyze the difference in clinical characteristics and outcomes between the two groups. All the epidemiological, clinical, imaging, and laboratory data were analyzed and contrasted. RESULTS: The incidence of fever on admission in imported patients was significantly higher than local patients. There was a significantly higher proportion of abnormal pulmonary signs, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, prolonged PT, elevated D-dimer and elevated blood glucose in imported patients. Compared with local patients, the proportion using antibiotics, glucocorticoids and gamma globulin were significantly higher in imported patients. The moderate type was more common in local patients, and the severe type were more frequent in imported patients. In addition, the median duration of viral clearance was longer in imported patients. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we found that imported cases were more likely to develop into severe cases, compared with local patients and required more powerful treatments.

There is evidence that obesity-related conditions may increase the severity of COVID-19 disease, especially in those below the age of 60. However, there has been limited research on mortality rate based on body mass index (BMI) in the older adult population, defined as age over 65. The objective of this study was to characterize outcomes in older adults infected with COVID-19 based on BMI. Study design and methods It is a single-center retrospective cohort study of older adults with COVID-19 infection. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes assessed were oxygen requirements, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical ventilation, and hospital length of stay. Data were analyzed with the Student’s t-test, Fisher’s exact test, and multiple logistic regression analyses as appropriate. Results A total of 290 patients were included in this study. The mean age was 77.6 years. The median BMI was >30 kg/m2. The primary outcome of hospital mortality occurred in 49.7% of patients. BMI was not found to be a predictor of mortality. Age 75-79 and age ≥ 85 were associated with an increased risk of mortality (OR: 2.58; 95% CI: 1.15 - 5.79; OR: 3.17; 95% CI: 1.35 - 7.44, respectively). Patients with a BMI < 18.5, BMI 18.5 - 25, and age ≥ 85 were less likely to require mechanical ventilation (OR: 0.06; 95% CI: 0.00 - 0.83; OR:0.11; 95% CI: 0.02 - 0.64 and OR:0.28; 95% CI: 0.09 - 0.92, respectively).

Currently, only symptomatic relief has been provided by FDA-approved therapeutic approaches for Parkinson's disease (PD). The present study aims to evaluate the potential of wedelolactone (WDL), a natural occurring coumestan found in Eclipta alba to mitigate the parkinsonism in Caenorhabditis elegans disease model. In the present studies, supplementation with 37.5 µM WDL exhibited a reduction in the level of &#945;-syn in an age-dependent manner (22% at day 5, p < 0.05; and 16% at day 10, p < 0.001, n = 30), along with improvement in neuronal health through basal movement, and elevated the dopamine levels evident through 1-nonanol repulsion results in wild-type and diseased worms. Moreover, WDL augmented the mitochondrial health in wild-type, PD-diseased, and mev-1 mutant worms that establish the inherent activity of WDL in the alleviation of oxidative stress. Furthermore, WDL supplementation significantly decreases the neutral lipid and triglyceride level and also alleviates protein carbonyl level in PD disease condition. The overall investigation will provide a pioneer to the future insights of PD research related to plant-based drugs. qPCR studies after WDL supplementation revealed alteration of genes involved in the regulation of various stress-responsive (sod-5, gst-4, skn-1), &#945;-syn-suppressing (lrk-1, ymel-1, lagr-1, grk-1), and mitochondrial (pink-1) genes.

Hylin a1 (IFGAILPLALGALKNLIK), an AMP extracted from the skin secretion of a South American frog, Hypsiboas albopunctatus, was found to show a strong cytotoxicity against bacteria and fungus, but also a considerable hemolytic action. Considering the toxicity of the peptide in eukaryotic cells, this work focuses on investigating the effects of the interaction of the Hylin a1 analogues W(6)Hya1, D(0)W(6)Hya1 and K(0)W(6)Hya1 with models of eukaryotic structures, namely zwitterionic liposomes of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and calf-thymus DNA (CT DNA). Through intrinsic Trp fluorescence we determined that the peptide affinity for fluid DPPC bilayers follows the decreasing order: D(0)W(6)Hya1 (+2) > W(6)Hya1 (+3) » K(0)W(6)Hya1 (+4). Fluorescence data also indicate that the Trp residue in the more positively charged peptide, K(0)W(6)Hya1, is less deep in the bilayer than the residue in the other two peptides. This finding is supported by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) data, which shows that both D(0)W(6)Hya1 and W(6)Hya1 disturb DPPC gel-fluid transition slightly more effectively than K(0)W(6)Hya1. DPPC DSC profiles are homogeneously disturbed by the three peptides, probably related to peptide-membrane diffusion. Surprisingly, the peptide that displays the lowest affinity for PC membranes and is located at the more superficial position in the bilayer, K(0)W(6)Hya1, is the most efficient in causing formation of pores on the membrane, as attested by carboxyfluorescein leakage assays. The three peptides were found to interact with CT DNA, with a deep penetration of the Trp residue into hydrophobic pockets of the double helix, as indicated by the significant blue shift on the Trp fluorescence, and the displacement of DNA-bound ethidium bromide by the peptides. The experiments of DNA electrophoresis confirm that Hylin peptides bind DNA in a concentration-dependent manner, inducing complete DNA retardation at the relative AMP/plasmid DNA weight ratio of ~17. These findings could help to better understand the AMPs toxic effects on eukaryotic cells, thus contributing to the design of healthier therapeutic agents.",2020-11-03,"Vignoli Muniz, Gabriel S.; De la Torre, Lilia I.; Duarte, Evandro L.; Lorenzón, Esteban N.; Cilli, Eduardo M.; Balan, Andrea; Lamy, M.

Nevertheless, we are focused on the pathomechanisms leading to CSS, including impairment of granule-mediated cytotoxicity, specific viral infections, excess IL-18, and Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. These mechanisms are often reflected in distinct clinical features, functional tests, and/or biomarker assessments. Moreover, these mechanisms often indicate specific, definitive treatments. This mechanism-focused organization is vital to both advancing the field and understanding the complexities in individual patients. However, increasing evidence suggests these mechanisms interact and overlap. Likewise, the utility of a broad term like “Cytokine Storm” is that it reflects a convergence on a systemic inflammatory phenotype that, regardless of cause or context, may be amenable to “inflammo-stabilization.” CSS research must improve our appreciation of its various mechanisms and their interactions and treatments, but it must also identify the signs and interventions that may broadly prevent CSS-induced immunopathology.",2020-09-29,"Canna, Scott W.; Cron, Randy Q.",J Allergy Clin Immunol,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/f401e0628f73533b6c3fdefa48a76f27091e2140.json,nan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007328/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674920313270; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2020.09.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674920313270?v=s5,221978871.0

MiRNAs contribute to RNA virus pathogenesis by promoting antiviral immune response, enhancing viral replication, or altering miRNA-mediated host gene regulation. Thus, exploration of the virus–miRNA interactions occurring in PHEV-infected host may lead to the identification of novel mechanisms combating the virus life cycle or pathogenesis. Here, we discovered that the expression of miR-10a-5p was constitutively up-regulated by PHEV in both the N2a cells in vitro and mice brain in vivo. Treatment with miR-10a-5p mimics allowed miR-10a-5p enrichment and resulted in a significant restriction in PHEV replication, suggesting widespread negative regulation of the RNA virus infection by miR-10a-5p. The outcomes were also evidenced by miR-10a-5p inhibitor over-expression. Luciferase reporter, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blotting analysis further showed that Syndecan 1 (SDC1), a cell surface proteoglycan associated with host defense mechanisms, acts as a target gene of miR-10a-5p during PHEV infection. Naturally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of SDC1 leads to a reduction in viral replication, implying that SDC1 expression is likely a favorable condition for viral replication. Together, the findings demonstrated that the abundant miR-10a-5p leads to downstream suppression of SDC1, and it functions as an antiviral mechanism in the PHEV-induced disease, providing a potential strategy for the prevention and treatment of PHEV infection in the future work.",2020-02-20,"Hu, Shiyu; Li, Zi; Lan, Yungang; Guan, Jiyu; Zhao, Kui; Chu, Dianfeng; Fan, Gencheng; Guo, Yuguang; Gao, Feng; He, Wenqi",Front Microbiol,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/3078165241b24fed34596efa9f563661f1caa00c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7044266.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32153518/,211190377.0

Until now, although the US has the most confirmed cases in the world and are still experiencing an increasing pandemic, several states insisted to re-open business activities and colleges while announced strict control measures. To provide a quantitative reference for official strategies, predicting the near future trend based on finer spatial resolution data and presumed scenarios are urgently needed. In this study, the first attempted COVID-19 case predicting model based on county-level demographic, environmental, and mobility data was constructed with multiple machine learning techniques and a hybrid framework. Different scenarios were also applied to selected metropolitan counties including New York City, Cook County in Illinois, Los Angeles County in California, and Miami-Dade County in Florida to assess the impact from lockdown, Phase I, and Phase III re-opening. Our results showed that, for selected counties, the mobility decreased substantially after the lockdown but kept increasing with an apparent weekly pattern, and the weekly pattern of mobility and infections implied high infections during the weekend. Meanwhile, our model was successfully built up, and the scenario assessment results indicated that, compared with Phase I re-opening, a 1-week and a 2-week lockdown could reduce 4%–29% and 15%–55% infections, respectively, in the future week, while 2-week Phase III re-opening could increase 16%–80% infections. We concluded that the mandatory orders in metropolitan counties such lockdown should last longer than one week, the effect could be observed.

Repurposing drugs that have shown promise in inhibiting other viral infections could allow for more rapid dispensation of urgently needed therapeutics. The Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is extensively glycosylated with 22 occupied N glycan sites and is required for viral entry. In other glycosylated viral proteins, glycosylation is required for interaction with calnexin and chaperone-mediated folding in the endoplasmic reticulum, and prevention of this interaction leads to unfolded viral proteins and thus inhibits viral replication. As such, we investigated two iminosugars, celgosivir, a pro-drug of castanospermine, and UV-4, or N-(9-methoxynonyl)-1-deoxynojirimycin, a deoxynojirimycin derivative. Iminosugars are known inhibitors of the &#945;-glucosidase I and II enzymes and were effective at inhibiting authentic SARS-CoV-2 viral replication in a cell culture system. Celgosivir prevented SARS-CoV-2-induced cell death and reduced viral replication and Spike protein levels in a dose-dependent manner in culture with Vero E6 cells. Castanospermine, the active form of celgosivir, was also able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, confirming the canonical castanospermine mechanism of action of celgosivir. The monocyclic UV-4 also prevented SARS-CoV-2-induced death and reduced viral replication after 24 hours of treatment, although the reduction in viral copies was lost after 48 hours.

Florida, California, and Texas showed recovered population percent around 40%, higher current PCR positive test results ranging from 7% to 13%. A higher recovered population mitigates the current positive value attainable by limiting the infectivity rate Re. This approach provides an alternate source of information on the pandemic's full time course since the serological testing only views a narrow time slice of its history due to the transient nature of the antibody response and its graduated expression dependency on the severity of the disease. The deficiency of serological testing to estimate the recovered population is made even more acute due to the large proportion of asymptomatic and sub-clinical cases in the COVID-19 pandemic",2020-08-17,"Gonzalez, J.

METHODS: Study data were collected over a 3-month period from June to September 2007. The survey research method was used. A total of 1500 randomly sampled registered nurses from 18 hospitals in Hunan, China completed self-report questionnaires. RESULTS: Of the 1500 nurses included in the study, 1444 returned valid self-report questionnaires. Compliance with standard precautions was found to be low in the surveyed nurses. With a maximum possible score of 80, the quartile range of the overall score for compliance for all nurses was 48.29 (upper quartile score 76.36, lower quartile score 28.07), which was occupied by 64.7% of the participants. The factors most affecting compliance were: standard precautions training (odds ratio (OR) 2.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.85–2.55) and knowledge (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.01–3.41), followed by hospital grade (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.79–1.86), presence of sharps disposal box in the department (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.10–3.41), general self-efficacy (OR 1.29, 95% CI 1.04–1.59), exposure experience (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56–0.85), and department in which the nurse worked (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.05–1.46).

Resumption of employment after lung transplantation is generally supported. In Switzerland, there are no data on long-term employment in people with cystic fibrosis undergoing lung transplantation. METHODS In a single-centre, cross-sectional study at a Swiss university hospital, clinical data from lung transplant recipients with cystic fibrosis, covering the transplantation period from January 1996 to December 2016, were analysed retrospectively. The potential influence of pre-lung transplantation factors (age, sex, lung function, body mass index, six-minute walk test distance, lung transplantation wait list time, paid employment on the wait list, education, relationship status, housing situation) and post-lung transplantation factors (chronic allograft dysfunction [CLAD], dialysis, cancer diagnosis [except skin cancer]) on paid employment and work percentage after lung transplantation were investigated using mixed logistic and linear regression models. Descriptive analyses of paid employment were performed for various periods after lung transplantation (<1, 1–3, 3–5, 5–10, >10 years). Data are reported as odds ratios (ORs) or coefficients (β) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS Eighty-four subjects (46.4% female) with a mean ± SD age of 29.9 ± 8.4 years were included in the study. Mean wait time for lung transplantation was 42.7 ± 40.2 weeks. The number (percentage) of subjects employed <1 year, 1–3 years, 3–5 years, 5–10 years and >10 years after lung transplantation was n = 23 (28%), n = 51 (65%), n = 44 (75%), n = 30 (68%) and n = 21 (75%), respectively. In mixed logistic regression models, pre-lung transplantation paid employment (OR 24.03, 95% CI 6.08 to 164.39, p <0.0001), academic education (OR 7.81, 95% CI 1.66 to 48.66, p = 0.01) and time post lung transplantation (on log scale, OR 5.81, 95% CI 3.15 to 12.78, p <0.0001) were the main factors influencing post-lung transplantation paid employment status. In mixed linear regression models, pre-lung transplantation paid employment (β = 21.40, 95% CI 10.98 to 31.81, p = 0.00014), academic education (β = 12.54, 95% CI 0.48 to 24.55, p = 0.05) and time post lung transplantation (on log scale, β = 8.96, 95% CI 6.17 to 11.82, p <0.0001) were the main factors influencing work percentage post lung transplantation. No evidence for an influence of clinical factors such as CLAD, cancer or dialysis on post-lung transplantation employment and work percentage was found. CONCLUSION Pre-transplant employment is the dominant factor influencing lung transplantation employment in people with cystic fibrosis.

lny6my8f,nan,WHO,Rethinking interleukin-6 blockade for treatment of COVID-19,nan,nan,nan,unk,"Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine with effects in immune regulation, inflammation, and infection. The use of drugs that inhibit IL-6 biological activity has been proposed as a treatment for patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The rationale for this approach includes commitment to the concept that inflammation is a cause of lung damage in COVID-19 and belief that IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory molecule. Observational data thought to support IL-6 inhibition include elevated circulating IL-6 levels in COVID-19 patients and association between elevated IL-6 and poor clinical outcomes. However, IL-6 has significant anti-inflammatory properties, which calls into question the rationale for employing IL-6 blockade to suppress inflammation-induced tissue injury. Also, studies suggesting a beneficial role for IL-6 in the host response to infection challenge the strategy of using IL-6 blockade to treat COVID-19. In studies of recombinant IL-6 injected into human volunteers, IL-6 levels exceeding those measured in COVID-19 patients have been observed with no pulmonary adverse events or other organ damage. These observations question the role of IL-6 as a contributing factor in COVID-19. Clinical experience with IL-6 receptor antagonists such as tocilizumab demonstrates increase in severe and opportunistic infections, raising concern about using tocilizumab and similar agents to treat COVID-19. Trials of drugs to inhibit IL-6 activity in COVID-19 are ongoing and will shed light on the role of IL-6 in COVID-19 pathogenesis.

For example, CFSE histogram data enable quantitative insight into cellular turnover rates by applying mathematical models and parameter estimation techniques. Several mathematical models have been developed using different types of deterministic or stochastic approaches. However, analysis of CFSE proliferation assays is based on the premise that the label is halved in the two daughter cells. Importantly, asymmetry of protein distribution in lymphocyte division is a basic biological feature of cell division with the degree of the asymmetry depending on various factors. Here, we review the recent literature on asymmetric lymphocyte division and CFSE-based lymphocyte proliferation analysis. We suggest that division- and label-structured mathematical models describing CFSE-based cell proliferation should take into account asymmetry and time-lag in cell proliferation.

Little is understood about its effects during pregnancy. AIMS: To describe the current understanding of COVID-19 illness in pregnant women, to describe obstetric outcomes and to identify gaps in the existing knowledge. METHODS: Medline Ovid, EMBASE, World Health Organization COVID-19 research database and Cochrane COVID-19 in pregnancy spreadsheet were accessed on 18/4, 18/5 and 23/5 2020. Articles were screened via Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The following were excluded: reviews, opinion pieces, guidelines, articles pertaining solely to other viruses, single case reports. RESULTS: Sixty articles were included in this review. Some pregnant participants may have been included in multiple publications, as admission dates overlap for reports from the same hospital. However, a total of 1287 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive pregnant cases are reported. Where universal testing was undertaken, asymptomatic infection occurred in 43.5-92% of cases. In the cohort studies, severe and critical COVID-19 illness rates approximated those of the non-pregnant population. Eight maternal deaths, six neonatal deaths, seven stillbirths and five miscarriages were reported. Nineteen neonates were SARS-CoV-2 positive, confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs. [Correction added on 2 September 2020, after first online publication: the number of neonates indicated in the preceding sentence has been corrected from 'Thirteen' to 'Nineteen'.] CONCLUSIONS: Where universal screening was conducted, SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy was often asymptomatic. Severe and critical disease rates approximate those in the general population. Vertical transmission is possible; however, it is unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 positive neonates were infected in utero, intrapartum or postpartum.

This finding seemingly supports the view that the automatically determined touch location in external space affects limb assignment: the crossed right hand is localized in left space, and this conflict presumably provokes hand assignment errors. Here, participants judged on which hand the first of two stimuli, presented during a bimanual movement, had occurred, and then indicated its external location by a reach-to-point movement. When participants incorrectly chose the hand stimulated second, they pointed to where that hand had been at the correct, first time point, though no stimulus had occurred at that location. This behavior suggests that stimulus localization depended on hand assignment, not vice versa. It is, thus, incompatible with the notion of automatic computation of external stimulus location upon occurrence.

However, implementing dietary advice in everyday life is difficult, because eating is not a distinguishable action, but a chain of activities, embedded in social practices and influenced by previous life experiences. This research aims to understand why and how eating practices are developed over the life-course by investigating influential life experiences – turning points – and coping strategies for eating practices of people with T2DM. METHODS: The Salutogenic Model of Health guided the study’s objective, study design and analysis. Seventeen interviews were performed and analysed based on the principles of interpretative phenomenological analysis. Narrative inquiry and the creation of timelines and food boxes were used as tools to facilitate reflection on turning points and eating practices. RESULTS: Turning points for unhealthier eating were experiences that strongly disturbed the participants’ emotional stability. These experiences included psychosocial trauma, physical health disorders, job loss, and smoking cessation. Turning points for healthier eating were experiences that significantly changed participants views on life and made participants reflective about the effects of current eating practices on future health and life goals. These turning points included confrontation with ill-health, becoming a parent, psychosocial therapy, and getting married. Notably, turning points for healthier eating seemed only to happen when life was relatively stress-free. All participants experienced turning points for healthier eating, yet, not all participants succeeded in improving their diets. Two coping styles were distinguished: active and passive coping. Active coping individuals were able to act in line with their personal intentions, whereas passive coping individuals could not. Differences between active and passive coping styles seemed to be explained by differences in available resources important for adapting and maintaining a healthy diet. CONCLUSION: Disadvantaged childhood and later life adversities together with the inability to manage the mental stress explained the development unhealthier eating practices. All participants experienced turning points for healthier eating that caused eating to become a priority in their life.

The aim of this article was to determine the prevalence and impact of virus and bacterial infections in acute asthma and COPD. METHODS: Subjects were recruited, within 24 h of hospital admission for acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD. Nose/throat swabs and sputum samples were collected and examined by multiplex polymerase chain reaction for respiratory viruses and cultured for bacteria. The primary outcomes were length of stay (LOS) and readmission to hospital within 60 days. RESULTS: A total of 199 subjects were recruited (96 had asthma and 103 COPD) for 235 events (36 re‐presented). A virus was detected in 79 subjects (40%), bacteria in 41 (21%), and of these, 18 had both. Rhinovirus A was the most frequently isolated virus. A multivariate analysis was performed to control for confounders. It found that detection of a virus, a virus and bacteria, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)) and a diagnosis of COPD were all independent predictors of prolonged LOS, while risk of readmission within 60 days was increased with virus infection alone, virus and bacterial infection, lower FEV(1) and current smoking.

The dates of the surge were determined using a fitting of the two last months of reported daily new cases in 18 European countries with latitude ranging from 39° to 62°. The study proves no correlation between the country surge date and the 2 weeks preceding temperature or humidity but shows an impressive linear correlation with latitude. The country surge date corresponds to the time when its sun UV daily dose drops below ≈ 34% of that of 0° latitude. Introducing reported seasonal blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration variation into the reported link between acute respiratory tract infection risk and 25(OH)D concentration quantitatively explains the surge dynamics. Several studies have already substantiated a 25(OH)D concentration impact on COVID-19 severity. However, by comparing different patient populations, discriminating whether a low 25(OH)D concentration is a real factor underlying COVID-19 severity or only a marker of another weakness that is the primary severity factor can be challenging. The date of the surge is an intrapopulation observation and has the benefit of being triggered only by a parameter globally affecting the population, i.e. decreases in the sun UV daily dose.

One explanation may be that SILS is technically demanding in morbidly obese patients. This report describes our technique and experience with single incision laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (SILAGB). METHODS Prospective data collection was performed on consecutive obese patients who underwent SILAGB between November 2009 and February 2011. A single 3 cm transverse incision in the right upper quadrant was used for a Covidien SILS™ multichannel access port. The technique is described with a standard pars flaccida approach and the 'tips and tricks' needed for a wide range of candidates using standard laparoscopic equipment. RESULTS A total of 29 patients (27 female) with a median body mass index of 41 kg/m(2) (range: 35-52 kg/m(2)) and median age of 44 years (range: 22-57 years) underwent SILAGB. There were no 'conversions' to a standard laparoscopic technique. Two cases required the addition of one single 5 mm port. The only complications were two postoperative wound infections (one with a port site infection requiring replacement of the port) and one faulty band requiring replacement. There were therefore two returns to theatre and no 30-day deaths. All patients were discharged on the first postoperative day. In this series, operative times reduced significantly to be comparable with the conventional laparoscopic approach. CONCLUSIONS SILAGB is safe and feasible in the morbidly obese.

Beclin-1 is an essential scaffold autophagy protein that forms two distinct subcomplexes with modulators Atg14 and UVRAG, responsible for autophagosome formation and maturation, respectively. In the present study, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers an incomplete autophagy response, elevated autophagosome formation but impaired autophagosome maturation, and declined autophagy by genetic knockout of essential autophagic genes reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication efficiency. By screening 28 viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2, we demonstrated that expression of ORF3a alone is sufficient to induce incomplete autophagy. Mechanistically, SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a interacts with autophagy regulator UVRAG to facilitate Beclin-1-Vps34-Atg14 complex but selectively inhibit Beclin-1-Vps34-UVRAG complex. Interestingly, although SARS-CoV ORF3a shares 72.7% amino acid identity with the SARS-CoV-2 ORF3a, the former had no effect on cellular autophagy response.

As one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, AD is characterized by the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the affected brain area. Microglia are the major regulators of neuroinflammation in the brain, and neuroinflammation has become recognized as the core pathophysiological process of various neurodegenerative diseases. In the central nervous system (CNS), microglia play a dual role in AD development. For one thing, they degrade amyloid β (Aβ) to resist its deposition; for another, microglia release pro-inflammatory and inflammatory factors, contributing to neuroinflammation as well as the spreading of Aβ and tau pathology. Wnt pathways are important regulators of cell fate and cell activities. The dysregulation of Wnt pathways is responsible for both abnormal tau phosphorylation and synaptic loss in AD. Recent studies have also confirmed the regulatory effect of Wnt signaling on microglial inflammation. Thus, the study of microglia, Wnt pathways, and their possible interactions may open up a new direction for understanding the mechanisms of neuroinflammation in AD. In this review, we summarize the functions of microglia and Wnt pathways and their roles in AD in order to provide new ideas for understanding the pathogenesis of AD.",2020-05-14,"Yang, Yunying; Zhang, Zhentao",Front Aging Neurosci,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/41c57404230010609f8143b0540c517bb7630205.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7241259.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7241259/,nan

Even though it is arguably not an established diagnostic tool, using machine learning-based analysis of COVID-19 medical scans has shown the potential to provide a preliminary digital second opinion. This can help in managing the current pandemic, and thus has been attracting significant research attention. In this research, we propose a multi-task pipeline that takes advantage of the growing advances in deep neural network models. In the first stage, we fine-tuned an Inception-v3 deep model for COVID-19 recognition using multi-modal learning, i.e., using X-ray and CT scans. In addition to outperforming other deep models on the same task in the recent literature, with an attained accuracy of 99.4%, we also present comparative analysis for multi-modal learning against learning from X-ray scans alone. The second and the third stages of the proposed pipeline complement one another in dealing with different types of infection manifestations. The former features a convolutional neural network architecture for recognizing three types of manifestations, while the latter transfers learning from another knowledge domain, namely, pulmonary nodule segmentation in CT scans, to produce binary masks for segmenting the regions corresponding to these manifestations. Our proposed pipeline also features specialized streams in which multiple deep models are trained separately to segment specific types of infection manifestations, and we show the significant impact that this framework has on various performance metrics.

We aim to investigate the dynamic changes of immune status in COVID-19 patients with clinical evolution. METHODS: Sixty-one COVID-19 patients (42 mild cases and 19 severe cases, 51 cases without secondary infection as non-infection group and 10 cases with secondary bacterial/fungal infection as infection group) and 52 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled from our hospital. Leucocyte classification, lymphocyte subsets and cytokines were detected by full-automatic blood cell analyzer and flow cytometer, respectively. RESULTS: Upon admission, eosinophils and lymphocyte subsets decreased significantly, while neutrophils, monocytes, basophils, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-Î³ increased significantly in COVID-19 patients compared to HCs. CD3+ T and DN (CD3+CD4-CD8-) cells appeared sustained decline, leucocytes, neutrophils and IL-10 showed sustained increase in severe group compared to mild group. Compared with the non-infection group, we observed a depletion of eosinophils, CD3+ T and CD4+ T cells, but leucocytes, neutrophils, IL-6 and IL-10 on the contrary in the infection group. Besides, in severe group of COVID-19 patients, DN cells were negatively correlated with IL-10, and DP (CD3+CD4+CD8+) cells were negatively correlated with IL-6. Lymphocytes, eosinophils, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, IL-6 and IL-10 all had great diagnostic efficacy (AUC, 0.905-0.975) for COVID-19.

Overlapping gene regions encode higher levels of intrinsic structural disorder (ISD) than nonoverlapping genes (39% vs. 25% in our viral dataset). This might be because of the intrinsic properties of the genetic code, because one member per pair was recently born de novo in a process that favors high ISD, or because high ISD relieves increased evolutionary constraint imposed by dual-coding. Here, we quantify the relative contributions of these three alternative hypotheses. We estimate that the recency of de novo gene birth explains [Formula: see text] or more of the elevation in ISD in overlapping regions of viral genes. While the two reading frames within a same-strand overlapping gene pair have markedly different ISD tendencies that must be controlled for, their effects cancel out to make no net contribution to ISD. The remaining elevation of ISD in the older members of overlapping gene pairs, presumed due to the need to alleviate evolutionary constraint, was already present prior to the origin of the overlap. Same-strand overlapping gene birth events can occur in two different frames, favoring high ISD either in the ancestral gene or in the novel gene; surprisingly, most de novo gene birth events contained completely within the body of an ancestral gene favor high ISD in the ancestral gene (23 phylogenetically independent events vs. 1).

Treatment options for CoVs are largely lacking. Here, we show that clofazimine, an anti-leprosy drug with a favorable safety and pharmacokinetics profile, possesses pan-coronaviral inhibitory activity, and can antagonize SARS-CoV-2 replication in multiple in vitro systems, including the human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and ex vivo lung cultures. The FDA-approved molecule was found to inhibit multiple steps of viral replication, suggesting multiple underlying antiviral mechanisms. In a hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, prophylactic or therapeutic administration of clofazimine significantly reduced viral load in the lung and fecal viral shedding, and also prevented cytokine storm associated with viral infection.

Since clofazimine is orally bioavailable and has a comparatively low manufacturing cost, it is an attractive clinical candidate for outpatient treatment and remdesivir-based combinatorial therapy for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, particularly in developing countries.

u2yq3no7,nan,WHO,Surface-Modified Ultrathin InSe Nanosheets with Enhanced Stability and Photoluminescence for High-Performance Optoelectronics,nan,nan,nan,unk,"Indium selenide (InSe) has become a research hotspot because of its favorable carrier mobility and thickness-tunable band gap, showing great application potential in high-performance optoelectronic devices. The trend of miniaturization in optoelectronics has forced the feature sizes of the electronic components to shrink accordingly. Therefore, atomically thin InSe crystals may play an important role in future optoelectronics. Given the instability and ultralow photoluminescent (PL) emission of mechanically exfoliated ultrathin InSe, synthesis of highly stable mono- and few-layer InSe nanosheets with high PL efficiency has become crucial. Herein, ultrathin InSe nanosheets were prepared via thermal annealing of electrochemically intercalated products from bulk InSe. The size and yield of the as-prepared nanosheets were up to â¼160 µm and â¼70%, respectively, and â¼80% of the nanosheets were less than five layer. Impressively, the as-prepared nanosheets showed greatly enhanced stability and PL emission because of surface modification by carbon species. Efficient photoresponsivity of 2 A/W was achieved in the as-prepared nanosheet-based devices. These nanosheets were further assembled into large-area thin films with photoresponsivity of 16 A/W and an average Hall mobility of about 5 cm2 V-1 s-1. Finally, one-dimensional (1D) InSe nanoscrolls with a length up to 90 µm were constructed by solvent-assisted self-assembly of the exfoliated nanosheets.",2020,"Hao, Qiaoyan; Liu, Jidong; Wang, Gang; Chen, Jiewei; Gan, Haibo; Zhu, Jiaqi; Ke, Yuxuan; Chai, Yang; Lin, Junhao; Zhang, Wenjing",ACS nano,nan,#32809802,nan,nan,nan,nan,221180264.0

We assessed the feasibility of a virtual GDMT Team for optimization of GDMT during hospitalization for non-CV conditions. Hypothesis A GDMT Team will improve GDMT optimization compared with usual care. Methods Consecutive hospitalized patients with HFrEF≤40% were prospectively identified. Patients with critical illness, cardiology consult, de-novo HF, COVID-19 & SBP ≤90mmHg were excluded. February 3 to March 1, 2020 served as a pre-intervention period during which patients were screened, but did not receive GDMT Team interventions. From March 2 to June 21, 2020, a pharmacist-physician team provided up to 1 suggestion daily for GDMT optimization (evidence-based ß-blockers, ACEi/ARB/ARNI, & MRA) to treating teams based on an evidence-based algorithm. The primary outcome of a composite GDMT optimization score, the net of positive therapeutic changes (+1 for new initiations/uptitrations) & negative therapeutic changes (-1 for discontinuations/downtitrations) during hospitalization, was compared between the pre- vs. post-intervention periods. Multivariable linear regression models were built adjusting associations for clinical factors. Safety outcomes requiring intervention or GDMT downtitration were identified. Results Of 187 encounters, 84 (45%) met eligibility criteria: 28 pre-intervention, 56 post-intervention. Mean age was 68±11 yrs, 70% men, and 61% White. Of 88 GDMT Team suggestions, 49 (56%) were followed by discharge. During the intervention, cumulative COVID-19 hospitalizations rose from 0 to 11085 in MA. Mean GDMT optimization score was -0.14 (95% CI: -0.58 to +0.30) pre-intervention & +0.64 (95% CI: +0.35 to +0.93) post-intervention (P=0.004). In a model inclusive of demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, potassium levels, eGFR, & LVEF, the intervention was the only factor associated with higher GDMT optimization score (β coeff 0.89; P=0.008). Safety events included 1 instance each of AKI, hyperkalemia, bradycardia, & hypotension. Conclusion Admission for non-CV conditions is a feasible setting for GDMT optimization.

This impression is supported by the relative lack of scientific publications related to feline vector-borne infections. This review explores the possible reasons for the difference between the two most common small companion animal species, including the hypothesis that cats might have a genetically-determined immunological resistance to arthropod vectors or the microparasites they transmit. A number of simple possibilities might account for the lower prevalence of these diseases in cats, including factors related to the lifestyle and behaviour of the cat, lesser spend on preventative healthcare for cats and reduced opportunities for research funding for these animals. The dog and cat have substantially similar immune system components, but differences in immune function might in part account for the markedly distinct prevalence and clinicopathological appearance of autoimmune, allergic, idiopathic inflammatory, immunodeficiency, neoplastic and infectious diseases in the two species. Cats have greater genetic diversity than dogs with much lower linkage disequilibrium in feline compared with canine breed groups. Immune function is intrinsically related to the nature of the intestinal microbiome and subtle differences between the canine and feline microbial populations might also impact on immune function and disease resistance. The reasons for the apparent lesser susceptibility of cats to arthropod-borne infectious diseases are likely to be complex, but warrant further investigation.",2016-09-20,"Day, Michael J.",Parasit Vectors,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/6d1b4e1200c1da4dff5048bdff36805e28511154.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5028948.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27646278/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-016-1798-5,14120024.0

Data from the Korea Influenza and Respiratory Surveillance System (KINRESS) showed an unusually high positive rate accounting for up to 20% of all diagnosed cases. To determine the principal cause of the outbreak, direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by sequence analysis targeting parts of the hexon gene of HAdV was performed. Serotypes of 1,007 PCR‐diagnosed HAdV‐positive samples from patients with an acute upper respiratory tract illness were determined and epidemiological characteristics including major aged group and clinical symptoms were analyzed. The principal symptom of HAdV infections was fever and the vulnerable aged group was 1–5 years old. Based on sequence analysis, HAdV‐3 was the predominant serotype in the outbreak, with an incidence of 74.3%. From the beginning of 2010 until May, the major serotypes were HAdV‐1, 2, and 5 (70–100%) in any given period. However, an outbreak dominated by HAdV‐3 started between July and August and peaked in September. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that there was no genetic variation in HAdV‐3. The results demonstrated that an outbreak of upper respiratory illness followed by H1N1 influenza pandemic in Korea was caused mainly by emerged HAdV‐3. J. Med.

It examines the use of predicted mean vote (PMV) in the outdoor context and illustrates the use of an alternative thermal index--physiological equivalent temperature (PET). The paper supports the conventional assumption that thermal neutrality corresponds to thermal comfort. Finally, predictive formulas for estimating outdoor thermal sensation are presented as functions of air temperature, wind speed, solar radiation intensity and absolute humidity.

Southeast Asia was the first region to be affected outside China, and although COVID-19 cases have been reported in all countries of Southeast Asia, both the policies and epidemic trajectories differ substantially, potentially due to marked differences in social distancing measures that have been implemented by governments in the region. This paper studies the across-country relationships between social distancing and each population's response to policy, the subsequent effects of these responses to the transmissibility and epidemic trajectories of SARS-CoV-2. The analysis couples COVID-19 case counts with real-time mobility data across Southeast Asia to estimate the effects of host population response to social distancing policy and the subsequent effects on the transmissibility and epidemic trajectories of SARS-CoV-2. A novel inference strategy for the time-varying reproduction number is developed to allow explicit inference of the effects of social distancing on the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 through a regression structure.

While the initial target of SARS-CoV-2 is the respiratory tract, it is becoming increasingly clear that there is a complex interaction between the virus and the immune system ranging from mild to controlling responses to exuberant and dysfunctional multi-tissue directed autoimmune responses. The immune system plays a dual role in COVID-19, being implicated in both the anti-viral response and in the acute progression of the disease, with a dysregulated response represented by the marked cytokine release syndrome, macrophage activation, and systemic hyperinflammation. It has been speculated that these immunological changes may induce the loss of tolerance and/or trigger chronic inflammation. In particular, molecular mimicry, bystander activation and epitope spreading are well-established proposed mechanisms to explain this correlation with the likely contribution of HLA alleles. We performed a systematic literature review to evaluate the COVID-19-related autoimmune/rheumatic disorders reported between January and September 2020. In particular, we investigated the cases of incident hematological autoimmune manifestations, connective tissue diseases, antiphospholipid syndrome/antibodies, vasculitis, Kawasaki-like syndromes, acute arthritis, autoimmune-like skin lesions, and neurologic autoimmune conditions such as Guillain–Barré syndrome. We screened 6263 articles and report herein the findings of 382 select reports which allow us to conclude that there are 2 faces of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2, that include a benign virus controlling immune response and a many faceted range of dysregulated multi-tissue and organ directed autoimmune responses that provides a major challenge in the management of this viral disease.

To date, there is no specific vaccine against the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2, nor is there an effective medicine for treating COVID-19, thus raising concerns with respect to the effect of risk factors such as clinical course and pathophysiological parameters on disease severity and outcome in patients with COVID-19. By extracting and analyzing all available published clinical data, we identified several major clinical characteristics associated with increased disease severity and mortality among patients with COVID-19. Specifically, preexisting chronic conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes are strongly associated with an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19; surprisingly, however, we found no correlation between chronic liver disease and increased disease severity. In addition, we found that both acute cardiac injury and acute kidney injury are highly correlated with an increased risk of COVID-19-related mortality. Given the high risk of comorbidity and the high mortality rate associated with tissue damage, organ function should be monitored closely in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and this approach should be included when establishing new guidelines for managing these high-risk patients. Moreover, additional clinical data are needed in order to determine whether a supportive therapy can help mitigate the development of severe, potentially fatal complications, and further studies are needed to identify the pathophysiology and the mechanism underlying this novel coronavirus-associated infectious disease. Taken together, these findings provide new insights regarding clinical strategies for improving the management and outcome of patients with COVID-19.",2020,"Wang, Xinhui; Fang, Xuexian; Cai, Zhaoxian; Wu, Xiaotian; Gao, Xiaotong; Min, Junxia; Wang, Fudi",Res.,nan,#252952,nan,nan,nan,nan,216652705.0

Moreover, the maintenance of metaphase spindle stability during meiosis I requires the synergism between Klp2 and the conserved microtubule crosslinker Ase1 as the absence of both proteins causes exacerbated defects in metaphase spindle stability.

Greater than 90% of all deaths from influenza A virus (IAV) occur in the elderly (>65 years of age). To address this age-related susceptibility to SARS-CoV and IAV, we infected C57BL/6 (B6) mice with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) or IAV (PR8), both of which cause severe disease in aged mice. Intranasal pretreatment of aged mice with poly(I·C) (a TLR3 agonist) and, to a lesser extent, CpG, R848, or lipopolysaccharide (TLR9, TLR7/8, or TLR4 agonists), provided a high level of protection [90% to 100% survival rate after poly(I·C) treatment] against lethal MA15 or IAV challenge and reduced pathological changes and virus loads in the lungs at early times after infection. Poly(I·C) pretreatment upregulated beta interferon (IFN-β), IFN-γ, IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene expression in the lungs. Intranasal pretreatment with IFN-β or IFN-γ but not IL-1β or TNF also protected aged mice, consistent with the notion that poly(I·C) pretreatment functioned, at least in part, by inducing IFN-β and IFN-γ. We also identified a potential cellular target for poly(I·C) by showing that treatment inhibited virus replication in primary human airway epithelial cells.

The COVID-19 outbreak and the safety measures taken to control it caused many psychological issues in populations worldwide, such as depression, anxiety, and stress. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to assess the psychological effects of the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak on university students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and to investigate the students' awareness of mobile mental health care apps as well as their attitudes toward the use of these apps. METHODS: A two-part self-administered web-based questionnaire was delivered to students at United Arab Emirates University. The first part of the questionnaire assessed the mental state of the participants using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), while the second part contained questions investigating the participants' awareness of and attitudes toward mental health care apps. Students were invited to fill out the web-based questionnaire via social media and mailing lists. RESULTS: A total of 154 students participated in the survey, and the majority were female. The results of the GHQ-12 analysis showed that the students were experiencing psychological issues related to depression and anxiety as well as social dysfunction. The results also revealed a lack of awareness of mental health care apps and uncertainty regarding the use of such apps. Approximately one-third of the participants (44/154, 28.6%) suggested preferred functionalities and characteristics of mobile mental health care apps, such as affordable price, simple design, ease of use, web-based therapy, communication with others experiencing the same issues, and tracking of mental status. CONCLUSIONS: Like many groups of people worldwide, university students in the UAE were psychologically affected by the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Although apps can be useful tools for mental health care delivery, especially in circumstances such as those produced by the outbreak, the students in this study showed a lack of awareness of these apps and mixed attitudes toward them.

Infections occurred at a rate of 1.2 episodes per person per annum (95% confidence interval 1.0 to 1.7; range 0-10) and were clinically indistinguishable. Lower respiratory tract symptoms complicated 65% of upper respiratory infections and increased the medical consultation rate 2.4-fold (chi 2 test P < 0.001). The median interval between onset of illness and medical consultation was 3 days for influenza and 5 days for other infections. Rhinoviruses caused the greatest disease burden overall followed by episodes of unknown aetiology, coronaviruses, influenza A and B, and respiratory syncytial virus. CONCLUSIONS Respiratory viruses cause substantial morbidity in elderly people. Although respiratory syncytial virus and influenza cause considerable individual morbidity, the burden of disease from rhinovirus infections and infections of unknown aetiology seems greater overall. The interval between onset of illness and consultation together with diagnostic difficulties raises concern regarding the role of antiviral drugs in treating influenza.",1997,"Nicholson, K G; Kent, J; Hammersley, V; Cancio, E",BMJ,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9366736/,29304376.0

The spontaneous structural transition to the postfusion state under mild conditions is independent of target cells. The prefusion trimer forms a tightly packed structure with three receptor-binding domains clamped down by a segment adjacent to the fusion peptide, significantly different from recently published structures of a stabilized S ectodomain trimer. The postfusion conformation is a rigid tower-like trimer, but decorated by N-linked glycans along its long axis with almost even spacing, suggesting possible involvement in a mechanism protecting the virus from host immune responses and harsh external conditions.

Many patients can be successfully weaned, the ability of some medications to facilitate weaning from veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were reported. To date, there are limited studies investigating the impact of levosimendan on veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation weaning. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effects of levosimendan on successful weaning from veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and survival in adult patients with cardiogenic shock. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis (PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform published from the year 2000 onwards) investigating whether levosimendan offers advantages compared to standard therapy or placebo, in cardiogenic shock adult patients treated with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The primary outcome was veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation successful weaning, whereas secondary outcome was all-cause mortality at the longest follow-up available. We pooled risk ratio and 95% confidence interval using fixed and random effects models according to the heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of five non-randomized clinical trials comprising 557 patients were included, 299 patients for levosimendan and 258 patients for control groups. The pooled prevalence of veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation successful weaning was 61.4% (95% confidence interval 39.8-82.9%), and all-cause mortality was 36% (95% confidence interval 29.6-48.8%). There was a significant increase in veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation successful weaning with levosimendan compared to the controls (risk ratio = 1.42 (95% confidence interval 1.12-1.8), p for effect = 0.004, I2 = 71%). A decrease risk of all-cause mortality in the levosimendan group was also observed, risk ratio = 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.44-0.88), p for effect = 0.007, I2 = 36%. CONCLUSION: The use of levosimendan on adult patients with cardiogenic shock may facilitate the veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation weaning and reduce all-cause mortality. Few articles of this topic are available, and prospective, randomized multi-center trials are warranted to conclude decisively on the benefits of levosimendan in this setting.",2020,"Burgos, Lucrecia María; Seoane, Leonardo; Furmento, Juan Francisco; Costabel, Juan Pablo; Diez, Mirta; Vrancic, Mariano; Aissaoui, Nadia; Benzadón, Mariano Noel; Navia, Daniel",Perfusion,nan,#707864,nan,nan,nan,nan,218872397.0

Until recently, the accurate prediction of binding affinity had been widely regarded as out of reach of theoretical methods owing to the lack of reproducibility of the available methods, not to mention their complexity, computational cost and time-consuming procedures. The lack of reproducibility stems primarily from the chaotic nature of classical molecular dynamics (MD) and the associated extreme sensitivity of trajectories to their initial conditions. Here, we review computational approaches for both relative and absolute binding free energy calculations, and illustrate their application to a diverse set of ligands bound to a range of proteins with immediate relevance in a number of medical domains. We focus on ensemble-based methods which are essential in order to compute statistically robust results, including two we have recently developed, namely thermodynamic integration with enhanced sampling and enhanced sampling of MD with an approximation of continuum solvent. Together, these form a set of rapid, accurate, precise and reproducible free energy methods. They can be used in real-world problems such as hit-to-lead and lead optimization stages in drug discovery, and in personalized medicine.

These viruses usually cause a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infection, however, they can also cause more severe symptoms, gastrointestinal and central nervous system diseases. These viruses are capable of flexibly adapting to new environments, hence health threats from coronavirus are constant and long-term. Immunogenic spike proteins are glyco-proteins found on the surface of Coronaviridae particles that mediate entry to host cells. The aim of this study was to train deep learning neural networks to produce simulated spike protein sequences, which may be able to aid in knowledge and/or vaccine design by creating alternative possible spike sequences that could arise from zoonotic sources in future. Results Here we have trained deep learning recurrent neural networks (RNN) to provide computer-simulated coronavirus spike protein sequences in the style of previously known sequences and examine their characteristics. Training used a dataset of alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronavirus spike sequences. In a test set of 100 simulated sequences, all 100 had most significant BLAST matches to Spike proteins in searches against NCBI non-redundant dataset (NR) and also possessed concomitant Pfam domain matches.

Here we propose a method to calculate the minimal amount of genomic information needed to construct organism (effective information) as a measure of organismal complexity, by using permutation and combination formulas and Shannon's information concept. RESULTS: The results demonstrate that the calculated information correlates quite well with the intuitive organismal phenotypic complexity defined by traditional taxonomy and evolutionary theory. From viruses to human beings, the effective information gradually increases, from thousands of bits to hundreds of millions of bits. The simpler the organism is, the less the information; the more complex the organism, the more the information. About 13% of human genome is estimated as effective information or functional sequence. CONCLUSIONS: The effective information can be used as a quantitative measure of phenotypic complexity of living organisms and also as an estimate of functional fraction of genome.

Previous studies on biomarkers in the ED setting has focused on identification of high risk patients, and and the ability to use biomarkers to identify low-risk patients has only been sparsely examined. The broader aims of the TRIAGE study are to develop methods to identify low-risk patients appropriate for early ED discharge by combining information from a wide range of new inflammatory biomarkers and vital signs, the present baseline article aims to describe the formation of the TRIAGE database and characteristize the included patients. METHODS We included consecutive patients ≥ 17 years admitted to hospital after triage staging in the ED. Blood samples for a biobank were collected and plasma stored in a freezer (-80 °C). Triage was done by a trained nurse using the Danish Emergency Proces Triage (DEPT) which categorizes patients as green (not urgent), yellow (urgent), orange (emergent) or red (rescusitation). Presenting complaints, admission diagnoses, comorbidities, length of stay, and 'events' during admission (any of 20 predefined definitive treatments that necessitates in-hospital care), vital signs and routine laboratory tests taken in the ED were aslo included in the database. RESULTS Between September 5(th) 2013 and December 6(th) 2013, 6005 patients were included in the database and the biobank (94.1 % of all admissions). Of these, 1978 (32.9 %) were categorized as green, 2386 (39.7 %) yellow, 1616 (26.9 %) orange and 25 (0.4 %) red. Median age was 62 years (IQR 46-76), 49.8 % were male and median length of stay was 1 day (IQR 0-4). No events were found in 2658 (44.2 %) and 158 (2.6 %) were admitted to intensive or intermediate-intensive care unit and 219 (3.6 %) died within 30 days. A higher triage acuity level was associated with numerous events, including acute surgery, endovascular intervention, i.v. treatment, cardiac arrest, stroke, admission to intensive care, hospital transfer, and mortality within 30 days (p < 0.001).

Worldwide, the delivery of transplant care is severely challenged by matters concerning - but not limited to - organ procurement, risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, screening strategies of donors and recipients, decisions to postpone or proceed with transplantation, the attributable risk of immunosuppression for COVID-19 and entrenched health care resources and capacity. The transplant community is faced with choosing a lesser of two evils: initiating immunosuppression and potentially accepting detrimental outcome when transplant recipients develop COVID-19 versus postponing transplantation and accepting associated waitlist mortality. Notably, prioritization of health care services for COVID-19 care raises concerns about allocation of resources to deliver care for transplant patients who might otherwise have excellent 1-year and 10-year survival rates. Children and young adults with end-stage organ disease in particular seem more disadvantaged by withholding transplantation because of capacity issues than from medical consequences of SARS-CoV-2. This report details the nationwide response of the Dutch transplant community to these issues and the immediate consequences for transplant activity. Worrisome, there was a significant decrease in organ donation numbers affecting all organ transplant services.

Atopy is an important risk factor for asthma persistence. Objective We sought to evaluate whether atopy is a risk factor for prolonged AHR after upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). Methods Twenty-five children (13 atopic and 12 nonatopic children) with intermittent virus-induced asthma were studied. Clinical evaluation, skin prick tests, methacholine bronchoprovocation, questionnaires, and a nasal wash specimen were obtained at baseline. For 9 months, subjects completed diary cards with respiratory symptoms. During their first reported cold, a nasal wash specimen was obtained. Methacholine provocation was performed 10 days and 5, 7, 9, and 11 weeks later. In case a new cold developed, the provocation schedule was followed from the beginning. Results Viruses were detected in 17 (68%) of 25 patients during their first cold, with rhinovirus being most commonly identified (82%). AHR increased significantly 10 days after the URI, equally in both groups (P =.67), and remained so up to the fifth week. Duration of AHR in subjects experiencing a single URI ranged from 5 to 11 weeks, without a significant difference between groups. In the duration of the study, atopic children experienced more colds and asthma exacerbations than nonatopic children. Thus for duration of AHR, significant prolongation was noted in the atopic group when assessed cumulatively. Conclusion In asthmatic children the duration of AHR after a single natural cold is 5 to 11 weeks. However, an increased rate of symptomatic cold and asthma episodes in atopic children is associated with considerable cumulative prolongation of AHR, which might help explain the role of atopy as a risk factor for asthma persistence.",2005-08-31,"Xepapadaki, Paraskevi; Papadopoulos, Nikolaos G.; Bossios, Apostolos; Manoussakis, Emmanuel; Manousakas, Theodoros; Saxoni-Papageorgiou, Photini",Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/6d340108379459c777ab70dd7483ab6135c8281f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7172284.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009167490500713X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16083783/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S009167490500713X,41666116.0

In the current scenario, COVID-19 patients experience severe respiratory syndromes, hence it is envisaged from our study that these traditional medicines are very likely to provide a favourable effect on COVID-19 infections. The active ingredients identified from these natural products are previously reported for antiviral activities against large group of viruses. Totally 47 bioactives identified from the medicinal plants were investigated against the structural targets of SARS-CoV-2 (Mpro and spike protein) and human ACE2 receptor. The top leads were identified based on interaction energies, number of hydrogen bond and other parameters that explain their potency to inhibit SARS-CoV-2. The bioactive ligands such as Cucurbitacin E, Orientin, Bis-andrographolide, Cucurbitacin B, Isocucurbitacin B, Vitexin, Berberine, Bryonolic acid, Piperine and Magnoflorine targeted the hotspot residues of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. In fact, this protease enzyme has an essential role in mediating the viral replication and therefore compounds targeting this key enzyme are expected to block the viral replication and transcription. The top scoring conformations identified through docking analysis were further demonstrated with molecular dynamics simulation.

This paper aims to collect and sorts out the existing drugs, which exert the ability to block the binding of S protein and ACE2 so as to provide directions for the later drug development. By reviewing the existing literature, we expound the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 from the perspective of S protein and ACE2 binding, and summarize the drugs and compounds that can interfere with the interaction of spike protein and ACE2 receptor from different ways. We summarized five kinds of substances, including peptide P6, griffithsin, hr2p analogs, EK1, vaccine, monoclonal antibody, cholesterol-depleting agents, and extracts from traditional Chinese medicine. They can fight SARS-CoV-2 by specifically binding to ACE2 receptor, S protein, or blocking membrane fusion between the host and virus. ACE2 is the key point for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the cells, and it is also the focus of drug intervention.

Using a survey experiment fielded in the midst of contentious public debate over flying fox management in urban and suburban areas of Australia, we find that stories with characters (i.e., narratives) are more effective than descriptive information at mobilizing support for different forms of bat management, including legal protection, relocation, and habitat restoration. We use conditional process analysis to show that narratives, particularly with accompanying images, are effective because they cause emotional reactions that influence risk perception, which in turn drives public opinion about strategies for risk mitigation. We find that prior attitudes towards bats matter in how narrative messages are received, in particular in how strongly they generate shifts in affective response, risk perception, and public opinion. Our results suggest that those with warm prior attitudes towards bats report greater support for bat dispersal when they perceive impacts from bats to be more likely, while those with cool priors report greater support for bat protection when they perceive impacts from bats to be more positive, revealing 1) potential opportunities for targeted messaging to boost public buy-in of proposals to manage risks associated with human-wildlife interactions, and 2) potential vulnerabilities to disinformation regarding risk.",2020,"Guenther, Sara K; Shanahan, Elizabeth A",PLoS One,nan,#1021672,nan,nan,nan,nan,229715719.0

Replication takes place in association with cytoplasmic membranes, which are heavily modified to create specific replication compartments. Here we have expressed by plasmid DNA transfection the large replicase polyprotein of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) in mammalian cells from a nonreplicating mRNA and provided a separate RNA containing the replication signals. The replicase proteins were able to efficiently and specifically replicate the template in trans, leading to accumulation of RNA and marker gene products expressed from the template RNA. The replicase proteins and double-stranded RNA replication intermediates localized to structures similar to those seen in SFV-infected cells. Using correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) with fluorescent marker proteins to relocate those transfected cells, in which active replication was ongoing, abundant membrane modifications, representing the replication complex spherules, were observed both at the plasma membrane and in intracellular endolysosomes. Thus, replication complexes are faithfully assembled and localized in the trans-replication system. We demonstrated, using CLEM, that the replication proteins alone or a polymerase-negative polyprotein mutant together with the template did not give rise to spherule formation. Thus, the trans-replication system is suitable for cell biological dissection and examination in a mammalian cell environment, and similar systems may be possible for other positive-strand RNA viruses.",2011,"Spuul, Pirjo; Balistreri, Giuseppe; Hellström, Kirsi; Golubtsov, Andrey V; Jokitalo, Eija; Ahola, Tero",Journal of virology,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00085-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21389137/,10758719.0

Quarantine in a sense similar to modern times was used in 1377 in Ragusa, today's Dubrovnik, during the plague epidemic. It was the first administratively imposed procedure in the world's history. It was later used in Venice and other rich port cities in the Mediterranean. On the territory of today's Poland, quarantine measures were used by the so-called Mayor of the Air - LukaszDrewno in 1623 during the plague epidemic in Warsaw. The quarantine left its mark on all areas of human activity. It affected all humanity in a way that is underestimated today. Throughout history, it has been described and presented visually. It is omnipresent in the world literature, art and philosophy. However, the isolation and closure of cities, limiting trade, had an impact on the economic balance, and the dilemma between the choice of inhabitants' health and the quality of existence, i.e. their wealth, has been the subject of discussions since the Middle Ages. Since the end of the 19th century, quarantine has lost its practical meaning. The discovery of bacteria and a huge development of medical and social sciences allowed limiting its range. In the 20th century isolation and quarantine no longer had a global range, because the ability to identify factors causing the epidemic, knowledge about the incubation period, carrier, infectiousness, enabled the rational determination of its duration and territorial range. The modern SARS COV 2 pandemic has resulted in a global quarantine on a scale unprecedented for at least three hundred years.

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Quaternary community medical center. Patients or Participants All consecutive pathology reports from patients who underwent surgery for clinically suspected endometriosis by three surgeons from the Division of Minimally Invasive Gynecologic Surgery between 01/01/2016 and 12/31/2019 were reviewed and categorized in two groups: endometriosis histologically confirmed, and endometriosis not histologically confirmed. A retrospective analysis of the patients without confirmed endometriosis was performed by evaluating clinical, surgical, and histologic characteristics. Interventions Laparoscopic surgery. Measurements and Main Results Of 487 patients, endometriosis was histologically confirmed in 419 (86.0%) and not confirmed in 68 (14.0%). Study group age range was 16 to 48 (median 30.5). Patients clinically presented with a variety of symptoms suspicious for endometriosis. 23 (33.8%) of the 68 patients without confirmed endometriosis had other gynecologic abnormalities, including leiomyomata, endometrial polyps or adenomyosis. 39 cases (57.3%) without confirmed endometriosis had non-specific histopathologic findings such chronic inflammation, fibrosis, adhesions, reactive changes, and hemosiderin deposits, while the remaining 29 (42.6%) had no histologic abnormalities. On laparoscopic evaluation, lesions appeared heterogeneous and suspicion of endometriosis was high in 10 (15%), low in 36 (53%), and absent in 22 (32%) patients. Laparoscopically, there were 14 cases without any abnormality visualized in the group with no histologic abnormalities (48%) compared to only 5 cases in the group with histologic findings (13%). Conclusion Despite the absence of histologically confirmed endometriosis, patients with clinically suspected disease still experience significant symptoms and management decisions remain challenging for both patientsand clinicians.

Moreover, removing LTCF cases from the analysis sharpens the analysis of the population in general, showing a more gradual increase in cases at the start of the pandemic and a steeper increase when the second surge occurred.

Current pandemics of SARS-CoV-2 represents a major health problem worldwide, with over four million cases and more than 300,000 deaths in the world. Development of effective therapy thus became an emergency. This report aims to highlight Resveratrol as possible therapeutic candidate in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The antiviral efficacy of Resveratrol was demonstrated for several viruses, including coronavirus. Resveratrol was shown to mitigate the major pathways involved in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, including regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), stimulation of immune system and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines release. It was also reported to promote SIRT1 and p53 signaling pathways and increase cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) immune cells. In addition, Resveratrol was demonstrated to be a stimulator of fetal hemoglobin and a potent antioxidant, by trapping reactive oxygen species (ROS). According to these reports, Resveratrol could be proposed as potential therapeutics in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

DESIGN: A stochastic model to determine clinical academic capacity in England, incorporating the following key factors which affect the ability to conduct research in the COVID-19 climate: (i) infection growth rate and population infection rate (from UK COVID-19 statistics and WHO); (ii) strain on the healthcare system (from published model); and (iii) availability of clinical academic staff with appropriate skillsets affected by frontline clinical activity and sickness (from UK statistics). SETTING: Clinical academics in primary and secondary care in England. PARTICIPANTS: Equivalent of 3200 full-time clinical academics in England. INTERVENTIONS: Four policy approaches to COVID-19 with differing population infection rates: ""Italy model"" (6%), ""mitigation"" (10%), ""relaxed mitigation"" (40%) and ""do-nothing"" (80%) scenarios. Low and high strain on the health system (no clinical academics able to do research at 10% and 5% infection rate, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of full-time clinical academics available to conduct clinical research during the pandemic in England. RESULTS: In the ""Italy model"", ""mitigation"", ""relaxed mitigation"" and ""do-nothing"" scenarios, from 5 March 2020 the duration (days) and peak infection rates (%) are 95(2.4%), 115(2.5%), 240(5.3%) and 240(16.7%) respectively. Near complete attrition of academia (87% reduction, <400 clinical academics) occurs 35 days after pandemic start for 11, 34, 62, 76 days respectively-with no clinical academics at all for 37 days in the ""do-nothing"" scenario. Restoration of normal academic workforce (80% of normal capacity) takes 11, 12, 30 and 26 weeks respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic COVID-19 crushes the science needed at system level. National policies mitigate, but the academic community needs to adapt.

It is clear now that the virus can cause far more damage in patients with comorbid conditions-particularly in those with respiratory, cardiovascular, or immune-compromised system-than in patients without such comorbidities. Drug use can further exacerbate the condition. In this regard, the ill effects of smoking are amply documented, and no doubt can be a confounding factor in COVID-19 progression. Although conflicting hypotheses on the potential role of nicotine in COVID-19 pathology have recently been offered, we believe that nicotine itself, through its interaction with the nicotinic cholinergic system, as well as ACE2, may not only be of use in a variety of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, but may also be of potential use in COVID-19. Thus, on one hand, while we strongly support smoking cessation as a means of harm reduction associated with COVID-19, on the other hand, we support a potential therapeutic role for nicotine, nicotinic agonists, or positive allosteric modulators of nicotinic cholinergic receptors in COVID-19, owing to their varied effects including mood regulation, anti-inflammatory, and purported interference with SARS-CoV-2 entry and/or replication.",2020,"Tizabi, Yousef; Getachew, Bruk; Copeland, Robert L; Aschner, Michael",FEBS j,nan,#714353,nan,nan,nan,nan,221122130.0

Methods: Viral RNA was extracted in throat swab and sputum sample of the patient and was performed real-time reverse transcription PCR detection and obtained viral genome by high-throughput sequencing method. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using 29 2019-nCoV genomes and 30 ß-coronavirus genomes deposited in NCBI GenBank. Fifteen genomes from Wuhan were grouped by mutation sites and others were identified by Wuhan's or specific mutation sites. Results: A 29 833 bp length genome of the first 2019-nCoV strain in Hangzhou was obtained, covering full length of the coding regions of coronavirus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the genome was closest to the genome of a bat SARS-like coronavirus strain RaTG13 with an identity of 96.11% (28 666/29 826). Among the genes between two genomes, E genes were highly conserved (99.56%), while S genes had lowest identity (92.87%).

Ninety percent of HRVs immunogenic variants use as receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a cell surface glycoprotein that promotes intercellular signaling in processes derived from inflammation response. As HRV receptor, ICAM-1 positions the virus to within striking distance of the membrane, and then triggers a conformational change in the virus that ultimately results in delivery of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm, across a lipid bilayer. The interaction between ICAM-1 and HRVs has been analyzed by the combination of crystal structures of HRVs and ICAM-1 fragments with electron microscopy reconstructions of the complexes.

ALI is associated with increased pulmonary microvascular hyperpermeability and alveolar flooding. The small Rho GTPases, RhoA and Rac1 are central regulators of vascular permeability through cytoskeleton rearrangements. RhoA and Rac1 have opposing functional outcome: RhoA induces an endothelial contractile phenotype and barrier disruption, while Rac1 stabilizes endothelial junctions and increases barrier integrity. In ALI, RhoA activity is increased while Rac1 activity is reduced. We have shown that the activation of RhoA in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated ALI, is dependent, at least in part, on a single nitration event at tyrosine (Y)34. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if the inhibition of Rac1 is also dependent on its nitration. Our data show that Rac1 inhibition by LPS is associated with its nitration that mass spectrometry identified as Y32, within the switch I region adjacent to the nucleotide-binding site. Using a molecular modeling approach, we designed a nitration shielding peptide for Rac1, designated NipR2 (nitration inhibitor peptide for the Rho GTPases 2), which attenuated the LPS-induced nitration of Rac1 at Y32, preserves Rac1 activity and attenuates the LPS-mediated disruption of the endothelial barrier in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC). Using a murine model of ALI induced by intratracheal installation of LPS we found that NipR2 successfully prevented Rac1 nitration and Rac1 inhibition, and more importantly attenuated pulmonary inflammation, reduced lung injury and prevented the loss of lung function. Together, our data identify a new post-translational mechanism of Rac1 inhibition through its nitration at Y32. As NipR2 also reduces sepsis induced ALI in the mouse lung, we conclude that Rac1 nitration is a therapeutic target in ALI.",2020,"Wang, Ting; Yegambaram, Manivannan; Gross, Christine; Sun, Xutong; Lu, Qing; Wang, Hui; Wu, Xiaomin; Kangath, Archana; Tang, Haiyang; Aggarwal, Saurabh; Black, Stephen M",Redox Biol,nan,#33248422,nan,nan,nan,nan,226840544.0

Influenza has been the primary driver of rapid laboratory testing due to its morbidity and mortality across all ages, the availability of antiviral therapy, which must be given early to have an effect, and the constant threat of new pandemic strains. Over the past 30 years, there has been an evolution in viral diagnostic testing, from viral culture to rapid antigen detection, and more recently, to highly sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), as well as a trend to testing at the point of care (POC). Simple rapid antigen immunoassays have long been the mainstay for POC testing for influenza A and B viruses and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) but have been faulted for low sensitivity. In 2015, the first POC NAAT for the detection of influenza was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), ushering in a new era. In 2017, the FDA reclassified rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) from class I to class II devices with new minimum performance standards and a requirement for annual reactivity testing. Consequently, many previously available RIDTs can no longer be purchased in the United States. In this review, recent developments in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA)-waived testing for respiratory virus infections will be presented, with the focus on currently available FDA-cleared rapid antigen and molecular tests primarily for influenza A and B viruses and RSV.",2018,"Azar, Marwan M; Landry, Marie L",Journal of clinical microbiology,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00367-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29695519/,13847042.0

A consequence, perhaps, of death becoming increasingly overmedicalised, nearly one in two UK nationals die institutional deaths. In this article we, two architectural scholars engaged in teaching, research and practice and a nurse and healthcare scholar with a focus on end-of-life care and peoples' experiences, wish to draw attention to a controversy resulting from a paucity in current literature on the terms of reference of the dying 'patient' as we navigate the future implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. This contributes to a relative lack of touchstones for architects to refer to when designing person-centred palliative care environments. Unlike common building types, architects are extremely unlikely to have lived experience of palliative care environments as patients; and therefore, require the help of healthcare professionals to imagine and empathise with the requirements of a person dying away from home. This paper includes a review of ageing and dying literature to understand, and distil from an architectural perspective, who, design professionals, are designing for and to remember the nuanced characteristics of those we hold a duty of care toward. We ask readers to heed the importance of accurate terms of reference, especially when commissioning and/or designing environments of palliative care.

As the virus has spread its tentacles across nations, territories, and continents, the civilized society has been compelled to face an unprecedented situation, never experienced before during peacetime. We are being introduced to an ever-growing new terminologies: ""social distancing,"" ""lockdown,"" ""stay safe,"" ""key workers,"" ""self-quarantine,"" ""work-from-home,"" and so on. Many countries across the globe have closed their borders, airlines have been grounded, movement of public transports has come to a grinding halt, and personal vehicular movements have been restricted or barred. In the past couple of months, we have witnessed mayhem in an unprecedented scale: social, economic, food security, education, business, travel, and freedom of movements are all casualties of this pandemic. Our experience about this virus and its epidemiology is limited, and mostly the treatment for symptomatic patients is supportive. However, it has been observed that COVID-19 not only attacks the respiratory system; rather it may involve other systems also from the beginning of infection or subsequent to respiratory infection. In this article, we attempt to describe the systemic involvement of COVID-19 based on the currently available experiences. This description is up to date as of now, but as more experiences are pouring from different corners of the world, almost every day, newer knowledge and information will crop up by the time this article is published.

Equal access to specialty care was assessed to identify potential barriers that may negatively impact telemedicine utilization. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series. METHODS: We examined the 6‐week period between March and May 2020 when the only access to nonurgent pediatric otolaryngology service was through telemedicine and compared it to in‐person visits during the same period in 2019. We compared patient demographics, including age, gender, preferred language, zip code of residence, and primary insurance plan. RESULTS: A total of 1,495 visits were conducted through telemedicine from March 23, 2020 to May 1, 2020, and 1983 in‐person visits were completed in 2019. There was no difference in patient age and gender. The proportions of Spanish‐speaking families were similar (15.8% in 2019 vs. 14.4% in 2020, P = .96). The percentage of Medi‐Cal‐insured patients (51.4% in 2019 vs. 49.8% in 2020, P = .73) and the mean poverty level (12.6% in 2019 vs. 12.2% in 2020, P = .38) also remained the same. Spanish‐speaking families were statistically more likely to require rescheduling of their telemedicine visits (17.2%) when compared to the overall rescheduling rate of 11.9% (P = .0083). CONCLUSIONS: We were able to successfully provide access to telemedicine services to our vulnerable populations during the current COVID‐19 pandemic. Telemedicine is likely to remain an essential mode of delivering patient care going forward. It is important to evaluate and identify potential disparities to telemedicine access and proactively implement changes to address these barriers. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 4.

The prevalence of diabetes patients hospitalized in intensive care units for COVID-19 is two- to threefold higher, and the mortality rate at least double, than that of non-diabetes patients. As the population with diabetes is highly heterogeneous, it is of major interest to determine the risk factors of progression to a more serious life-threatening COVID-19 infection. This brief review discusses the main findings of CORONADO, a prospective observational study in France that specifically addressed this issue as well as related observations from other countries, mainly China and the US. Some prognostic factors beyond old age have been identified: for example, an increased body mass index is a major risk factor for requiring respiratory assistance. Indeed, obesity combines several risk factors, including impaired respiratory mechanics, the presence of other comorbidities and inappropriate inflammatory responses, partly due to ectopic fat deposits. While previous diabetic microvascular (renal) and macrovascular complications also increase risk of death, the quality of past glucose control had no independent influence on hospitalized diabetes patient outcomes, and whether the quality of glucose control might modulate risk of COVID-19 in non-hospitalized diabetes patients is still unknown. In addition, no negative signs regarding the use of RAAS blockers and DPP-4 inhibitors and outcomes of COVID-19 could be identified. Hyperglycaemia at the time of hospital admission is associated with poor outcomes, but it may simply be considered a marker of severity of the infection. Thus, the impact of glucose control during hospitalization on outcomes related to COVID-19, which was not investigated in the CORONADO study, is certainly deserving of specific investigation.",2020-05-21,"Scheen, André J.; Marre, Michel; Thivolet, Charles",Diabetes Metab,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/71f9b37a8aa0da359c28ddc310861ec9a926f85d.json,nan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1262363620300859?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1262363620300859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32447101/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabet.2020.05.008,218763972.0

The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has caused a major public health concern across the globe. The SARS-CoV is the seventh coronavirus that is known to cause human disease. There are currently no promising antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention.

Thus, it is of utmost important priority to develop novel therapies for COVID-19. It is not fully investigated whether noncoding RNAs regulate signaling pathways that SARS-CoV involved in. Hence, computational analysis of the noncoding RNA interactions and determining importance of key regulatory noncoding RNAs in antiviral defense mechanisms will likely be helpful in developing new drugs to attack SARS-CoV infection.. To elucidate this, we utilized bioinformatic approaches to find the interaction network of SARS-CoV/human proteins, miRNAs, and lncRNAs. We found TGF-beta signaling pathway as one of the potential interactive pathways.

The number of deaths has increased with the increase in the number of infected patients. We aimed to develop a clinical model to predict the outcome of severe COVID-19 patients early. Methods Epidemiological, clinical, and first laboratory findings after admission of 183 severe COVID-19 patients (115 survivors and 68 nonsurvivors) from the Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital were used to develop the predictive models. Five machine learning approaches (logistic regression, partial least squares regression, elastic net, random forest, and bagged flexible discriminant analysis) were used to select the features and predict the patients' outcomes. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was applied to compare the models' performance. Sixty-four severe COVID-19 patients from the Optical Valley Branch of Tongji Hospital were used to externally validate the final predictive model. Results The baseline characteristics and laboratory tests were significantly different between the survivors and nonsurvivors. Four variables (age, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, lymphocyte count, and d-dimer level) were selected by all five models. Given the similar performance among the models, the logistic regression model was selected as the final predictive model because of its simplicity and interpretability. The AUROCs of the derivation and external validation sets were 0.895 and 0.881, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.892 and 0.687 for the derivation set and 0.839 and 0.794 for the validation set, respectively, when using a probability of death of 50% as the cutoff.

A critical step of the infection cycle is the binding of the virus spike S protein to the cellular ACE-2 receptor. This interaction involves a receptor binding domain (RBD) located at the center of the S trimer, whereas the lateral N-terminal domain (NTD) displays a flat ganglioside binding site that enables the virus to bind to lipid rafts of the plasma membrane, where the ACE-2 receptor resides. S protein binding to lipid rafts can be blocked by hydroxychloroquine, which binds to gangliosides, and by azithromycin, which binds to the NTD. Based on these data, we identified the NTD of SARS-CoV-2 as a promising target for both therapeutic and vaccine strategies, a notion later supported by the discovery, in convalescent Covid-19 patients, of a neutralizing antibody (4A8) that selectively binds to the NTD. The 4A8 epitope overlaps the ganglioside binding domain, denying any access of the virus to lipid rafts when the antibody is bound to the S protein. Thus, our data explain why antibody binding to the tip of the NTD results in SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. The high level of conservation of the ganglioside binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 (100% identity in 584 of 600 isolates analyzed worldwide) offers unique opportunities for innovative vaccine/therapeutic strategies.",2020,"Fantini, Jacques; Chahinian, Henri; Yahi, Nouara",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,nan,#887051,nan,nan,nan,nan,222253680.0

METHODS: 206 serum samples were collected from patients who were treated in the General Hospital of the Central Theater Command of the PLA between January 18 and April 4, 2020. 270 serum samples from healthy blood donors were used as control. IgM and total antibodies (Ab) against SARS-CoV-2 were detected by Chemiluminescence Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA). RESULTS: Among the 206 patients, the positive rate of IgM and Ab were 149/206 (72.3 %) and 187/206 (90.8 %), respectively. And the specificity of IgM and Ab detection were 99.3 % and 98.9 %, respectively. The sensitivity of CMIA for Ab detection was significantly higher than that of IgM. An increase of the positive rate and S/CO value for detecting IgM and Ab accompanied with the increasing of days post-disease onset (d.p.o.) were observed. The positive rate of Ab detected by CMIA increased rapidly after 7 d.p.o., while that of IgM was obviously increased after 14 d.p.o.. In addition, the age and gender of these patients did not affect the seroconversion and titer of antibodies during the whole course. The disease-severity of patients had no effect on the seroconversion of antibodies. However, the critical patients possessed a much higher antibody titers than the no-critical cases after 14 d.p.o..

METHODS This prospective study, approved by local ethical committee, enrolled 38 patients with primary OC, 2011-2014. After preoperative DCE-MRI (3.0 T), two observers measured perfusion (Ktrans, Kep, Ve, Vp) and semi-quantitative parameters (area under the curve, peak, time-to-peak) by drawing regions of interest (ROIs) covering the large solid lesion (L-ROI) and the most enhancing small area (S-ROI) (NordicICE platform). Kruskal-Wallis was used to analyze associations between MRI parameters and classified prognostic factors. RESULTS Mean Ktrans values were higher in high-grade serous OC than in other types (L-ROI, P = 0.041; S-ROI, P = 0.018), and lower mean Ktrans values predicted residual tumor (L-ROI P = 0.030; S-ROI, P = 0.012). Higher minimum Vp values were associated with higher International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage (S-ROI, P = 0.023).Shorter recurrence-free survival was predicted by higher Ve (minimum L-ROI, P = 0.035; maximum S-ROI, P = 0.046), Vp (maximum S-ROI, P = 0.033), and lower time-to-peak (maximum S-ROI, P = 0.047) in Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multiparametric MRI variables combining DCE and diffusion weighted data were also predictive for survival.

Here, we investigate the intramolecular and intermolecular RNA interactions of wildtype (WT) and a mutant (Δ382) SARS-CoV-2 virus in cells using high throughput structure probing on Illumina and Nanopore platforms. We identified twelve potentially functional structural elements within the SARS-CoV-2 genome, observed that identical sequences can fold into divergent structures on different subgenomic RNAs, and that WT and Δ382 virus genomes can fold differently. Proximity ligation sequencing experiments identified hundreds of intramolecular and intermolecular pair-wise interactions within the virus genome and between virus and host RNAs. SARS-CoV-2 binds strongly to mitochondrial and small nucleolar RNAs and is extensively 2’-O-methylated. 2’-O-methylation sites in the virus genome are enriched in the untranslated regions and are associated with increased pair-wise interactions. SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a global decrease of 2’-O-methylation sites on host mRNAs, suggesting that binding to snoRNAs could be a pro-viral mechanism to sequester methylation machinery from host RNAs towards the virus genome.

Combating such global diseases requires in-depth knowledge of their epidemiology. The only practical method for discovering global epidemiological knowledge and identifying prophylactic strategies is simulation. However, several interrelated factors, including increasing model complexity, stochastic nature of diseases, and short analysis timeframes render exhaustive analysis an infeasible task. An effective approach to alleviate the aforementioned issues and enable efficient epidemiological analysis is to manually steer bio-simulations to scenarios of interest. Selective steering preserves causality, inter-dependencies, and stochastic characteristics in the model better than “seeding”, i.e., manually setting simulation state. Accordingly, we have developed a novel Eco-modeling and bio-simulation environment called SEARUMS. The bio-simulation infrastructure of SEARUMS permits a human-in-the-loop to steer the simulation to scenarios of interest so that epidemics can be effectively modeled and analyzed. This article discusses mathematical principles underlying SEARUMS along with its software architecture and design. In addition, the article also presents the bio-simulations and multi-faceted case studies conducted using SEARUMS to elucidate its ability to forecast timelines, epicenters, and socio-economic impacts of epidemics. Currently, the primary emphasis of SEARUMS is to ease global epidemiological analysis of avian influenza.

The study determined that rats that were provided access to the full multilevel cage during testing after initial restriction to the lower level of the cage demonstrated behavioral changes consistent with a positive affective state, while those with no changes to their housing situation had no significant differences in their affective states. Rats that were consistently housed with access restricted to the lower level of the cage exhibited a tendency to increased neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios as compared with those provided with access to all levels of the multilevel cage. There were no differences in body weight demonstrated between the experimental groups. Overall use of the cage space, as documented through analysis of behavioral observations in the home cage, demonstrated no significant differences in preferred location in the cage during the light or dark cycles, though rats with access to both levels of the cage were significantly more active during the light cycle.

Broad-spectrum therapies capable of inhibiting CoV infections would address an immediate unmet medical need and could be invaluable in the treatment of emerging and endemic CoV infections. We show that a nucleotide prodrug, GS-5734, currently in clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus disease, can inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in multiple in vitro systems, including primary human airway epithelial cell cultures with submicromolar IC50 values. GS-5734 was also effective against bat CoVs, prepandemic bat CoVs, and circulating contemporary human CoV in primary human lung cells, thus demonstrating broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity.

Here, we utilized a unique dataset of ACE2 sequences from 410 vertebrate species, including 252 mammals, to study the conservation of ACE2 and its potential to be used as a receptor by SARS-CoV-2. We designed a five-category binding score based on the conservation properties of 25 amino acids important for the binding between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Only mammals fell into the medium to very high categories and only catarrhine primates into the very high category, suggesting that they are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We employed a protein structural analysis to qualitatively assess whether amino acid changes at variable residues would be likely to disrupt ACE2/SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding and found the number of predicted unfavorable changes significantly correlated with the binding score. Extending this analysis to human population data, we found only rare (frequency <0.001) variants in 10/25 binding sites. In addition, we found significant signals of selection and accelerated evolution in the ACE2 coding sequence across all mammals, and specific to the bat lineage.

This study aimed to determine the performance of pneumococcal load quantified with a real-time polymerase-chain reaction in nasopharyngeal samples to diagnose invasive pneumococcal disease in children. METHODS: Matched case-control study of patients <5 years of age with invasive pneumococcal disease admitted to the Manhiça District Hospital (Mozambique) and asymptomatic controls recruited in different periods between 2006 and 2014. Cases were confirmed by a positive bacterial culture for S. pneumoniae in blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from cases and controls and pneumococcal density was quantified by lytA real-time polymerase-chain reaction. RESULTS: Thirty cases (median age 12.8 months) and sixty controls (median age 11.7 months) were enrolled and 70% of them were male. Nasopharyngeal pneumococcal carriage was high in both groups: 28/30 (93.3%) for cases vs. 53/60 (88.3%) for controls (p = 0.71). Mean nasopharyngeal pneumococcal load was identified as a marker for invasive pneumococcal disease (7.0 log(10) copies/mL in cases vs. 5.8 log(10) copies/mL in controls, p<0.001) and showed good discriminatory power (AUC-ROC: 82.1%, 95% CI 72.5%-91.8%).

This undermines patient safety and creates a potential source of major morbidity and mortality. Understanding the factors that influence prescribing behaviour may allow development of interventions to reduce PIP. The aim of this study is to apply the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to explore barriers to effective prescribing for older adults in the ambulatory setting. METHODS A scoping review was performed based on the five-stage methodological framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley. From 30 Aug 2018 to 5 Sep 2018, we conducted our search on PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science. We also searched five electronic journals, Google and Google Scholar to identify additional sources and grey literature. Two reviewers applied eligibility criteria to the title and abstract screening, followed by full text screening, before systematically charting the data. RESULTS A total of 5731 articles were screened. Twenty-nine studies met the selection criteria for qualitative analysis. We mapped our results using the 14-domain TDF, eventually identifying 10 domains of interest for barriers to effective prescribing. Of these, significant domains include physician-related factors such as ""Knowledge"", ""Skills"", and ""Social/Professional Role and Identity""; issues with ""Environmental Context and Resources""; and the impact of ""Social Influences"" and ""Emotion"" on prescribing behaviour. CONCLUSION The TDF elicited multiple domains which both independently and collectively lead to barriers to effective prescribing for older adults in the ambulatory setting. Changing the prescribing climate will thus require interventions targeting multiple stakeholders, including physicians, patients and hospital/clinic systems. Further work is needed to explore individual domains and guide development of frameworks to aid guide prescribing for older adults in the ambulatory setting.",2020-11-09,"Lau, Sabrina; Lun, Penny; Ang, Wendy; Tan, Keng Teng; Ding, Yew Yoong",BMC geriatrics,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-020-01766-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33167898/,226279408.0

The present study examined change in loneliness in response to the social restriction measures taken to control the coronavirus spread. A nationwide sample of American adults (N = 1,545; 45% women; ages 18 to 98, M = 53.68, SD = 15.63) was assessed on three occasions: in late January/early February 2020 (before the outbreak), in late March (during the President's initial ""15 Days to Slow the Spread"" campaign), and in late April (during the ""stay-at-home"" policies of most states). Contrary to expectations, there were no significant mean-level changes in loneliness across the three assessments (d = .04, p > .05). In fact, respondents perceived increased support from others over the follow-up period (d = .19, p < .01). Older adults reported less loneliness overall compared to younger age groups but had an increase in loneliness during the acute phase of the outbreak (d = .14, p < .05). Their loneliness, however, leveled off after the issuance of stay-at-home orders. Individuals living alone and those with at least one chronic condition reported feeling lonelier at baseline but did not increase in loneliness during the implementation of social distancing measures. Despite some detrimental impact on vulnerable individuals, in the present sample, there was no large increase in loneliness but remarkable resilience in response to COVID-19.

However, due to limited resources, re-assessment of treatment paradigms in the wake of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is urgently required. In this rapid review, we described contemporary oncological outcomes for OSCC using non-surgical modalities. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted for articles published between January 1, 2010 and April 1, 2020 on MEDLINE and Cochrane CENTRAL. Studies were included if they contained patients with OSCC treated with either neoadjuvant, induction, or definitive radiotherapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or combination thereof, and an outcome of overall survival. RESULTS: In total, 36 articles were identified. Definitive radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy were the focus of 18 articles and neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy were the focus of the other 18 articles. In early stage OSCC, definitive radiotherapy, with or without concurrent chemotherapy, was associated with a significantly increased hazard of death compared to definitive surgery (HR: 2.39, 95% CI: 1.56 - 3.67, I(2): 63%). The hazard of death was non-significantly increased with definitive chemoradiotherapy in studies excluding early disease (HR: 1.98, 95% CI: 0.85 - 4.64, I(2): 84%). Two recent randomized control trials have been conducted, demonstrating no survival advantage to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that primary radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy are inferior to surgical management for OSCC.

Protection was obtained in 3/5 animals that remained asymptomatic, IDR positive and parasite free, 1 year after infection. Furthermore, the asymptomatic, FML-vaccine treated dogs showed stable anti-FML IgG1 levels, increasing IgG2 levels and 79–95% of positive DTH response, during the whole experiment. Twenty-two months after complete vaccination, no obits due to visceral leishmaniasis were recorded and 90% of these dogs were still asymptomatic, healthy and parasite free.

As a result of the full-text evaluation, 12 retrospective articles covering all the data related were selected. A total of 181 pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infections were included in the meta-analysis within the scope of these articles. According to the results, the incidence of fever was 38.1% (95% CI: 14.2-65%) and cough was 22% (95% CI: 10.8-35.2%) among all clinical features of pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection. So, fever and cough are the most common symptoms in pregnant cases with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 91.8% (95% CI: 76.7-99.9%) of RT-PCR results are positive. Moreover, abnormal CT incidence is 97.9% (95% CI: 94.2-99.9%) positive. No case was death. However, as this virus spreads globally, it should not be overlooked that the incidence will increase in pregnant women and maybe in the risky group. RT-PCR and CT can be used together in an accurate and safe diagnosis.

Soluble cluster of differentiation (CD)14 subtype (sCD14-ST also termed presepsin PSP) is a regulatory factor that modulates immune responses by interacting with T and B cells, useful for early diagnosis, prognosis and risk stratification prediction. METHODS: In 75 consecutive patients suffering from COVID-19 microbiology proven infection, admitted to intensive care unit (ICU, n = 21, 28%) and/or in infectious disease ward (IW, n = 54, 72%), PSP (Pathfast, Mitsubishi, Japan) has been measured in addition to routine laboratory tests performed during the period of hospitalization (from January to March 2020). RESULTS: PSP demonstrates: -statistically significant higher values (Mann-Whitney test) in 6 patients died (median, IQR = 1046, 763-1240; vs 417, 281-678 ng/L, p < 0.05); -statistically significant but poor correlations with CRP (r = 0.59, p < 0.001), LDH (r = 0.52, p < 0.001) and PCT (r = 0.72, p < 0.001) measured at the same day; -a significant relationship between concentrations and ICU stay.

While its precise function is not clearly defined, E is a pivotal player in the morphogenesis of the virion envelope. Expression of the E protein alone results in its incorporation into vesicles that are released from cells, and the coexpression of the E protein with the membrane protein M leads to the assembly of coronavirus-like particles. We have previously generated E gene mutants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that had marked defects in viral growth and produced virions that were aberrantly assembled in comparison to wild-type virions. We have now been able to obtain a viable MHV mutant in which the entire E gene, as well as the nonessential upstream genes 4 and 5a, has been deleted. This mutant (Delta E) was obtained by a targeted RNA recombination method that makes use of a powerful host range-based selection system. The Delta E mutant produces tiny plaques with an unusual morphology compared to plaques formed by wild-type MHV. Despite its low growth rate and low infectious titer, the Delta E mutant is genetically stable, showing no detectable phenotypic changes after several passages. The properties of this mutant provide further support for the importance of E protein in MHV replication, but surprisingly, they also show that E protein is not essential.",2003,"Kuo, Lili; Masters, Paul S",Journal of virology,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12663766/,30956184.0

Therefore, we evaluated whether P ETCO2 /P aCO2 might be relevant in assessing ARDS not associated with COVID-19. METHODS: We evaluated the correspondence between P ETCO2 /P aCO2 and the ratio of dead space to tidal volume (VD/VT) measured in 561 subjects with ARDS from a previous study in whom P ETCO2 data were also available. Subjects also were analyzed according to 4 ranges of P ETCO2 /P aCO2 representing increasing illness severity (&#8805; 0.80, 0.6-0.79, 0.50-0.59, and < 0.50). Correlation was assessed by either Pearson or Spearman tests, grouped comparisons were assessed using either ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis tests and dichotomous variables assessed by Fisher Exact tests. Normally distributed data are presented as mean and standard deviation(SD) and non-normal data are presented as median and inter-quartile range (IQR). Overall mortality risk was assessed with multivariate logistic regression. Alpha was set at 0.05. RESULTS: P ETCO2 /P aCO2 correlated strongly with VD/VT (r = -0.87 [95% CI -0.89 to -0.85], P < .001). Decreasing P ETCO2 /P aCO2 was associated with increased VD/VT and hospital mortality between all groups. In the univariate analysis, for every 0.01 decrease in P ETCO2 /P aCO2 , mortality risk increased by â¼1% (odds ratio 0.009, 95% CI 0.003-0.029, P < .001) and maintained a strong independent association with mortality risk when adjusted for other variables (odds ratio 0.19, 95% CI 0.04-0.91, P = .039). P ETCO2 /P aCO2 < 0.50 was characterized by very high mean ± SD value for VD/VT (0.82 ± 0.05, P < .001) and high hospital mortality (70%).

However, we know very little about the real-world mechanisms that drive such clustering, particularly in systems where cognitive limitations make it unlikely that mechanisms such as score keeping and reputation are at play. Here, we show that Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) use a 'walk away' strategy, a simple social heuristic by which assortment by cooperativeness can come about among mobile agents. Guppies cooperate during predator inspection and we found that when experiencing defection in this context, individuals prefer to move to a new social environment, despite having no prior information about this new social group.

zuienq1w,nan,WHO,Vertical transmission and kidney damage in newborns whose mothers had coronavirus disease 2019 during pregnancy,nan,nan,nan,unk,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic. However, the hazard to newborns in pregnancy remains controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the vertical transmission of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from mother to child and developmental toxicity in the fetus. METHODS: All clinical information was recorded on 22 neonates born to mothers with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia in Tongji Hospital. RESULTS: The average birth weight of the 22 newborns (16 males and 6 females) was 2980 g, and the mean gestational week was 37W+3. The birth weight of three babies was <2500 g, and the gestational week of all three low-birth-weight neonates was less than 36W. Three newborns had minor lesions of infection in the lungs as shown by computed tomography (CT) scans. Furthermore, three newborns had elevated SARS-CoV-2-related immunoglobin M (IgM) antibodies, and 11 newborns (52.4%) had positive immunoglobin G (IgG) antibodies. Notably, both cystatin C and ß2-microglobulin were increased in all newborns. Five of the 21 tested newborns had leukocytosis, and 11 had increased neutrophil levels. In addition, the aspartate aminotransferase of 18 newborns and the Î³-glutamyl transpeptidase of 19 newborns were increased. Total bilirubin was elevated in all newborns and serum albumin was reduced in 20 of 22 newborns. CONCLUSIONS: This study was the first to discover that COVID-19 infection in the third trimester of pregnancy could cause fetal kidney developmental injury, as indicated by increased cystatin C and ß2-microglobulin in all neonates.

Stimulation of a proper immune response that leads to protection is highly dependent on presentation of epitopes to circulating T-cells via the HLA complex. SARS-CoV-2 is a large RNA virus and testing of all of its overlapping peptides in vitro to deconvolute an immune response is not feasible. Therefore HLA-binding prediction tools are often used to narrow down the number of peptides to test. We tested NetMHC suite tools' predictions by using an in vitro peptide-MHC stability assay. We assessed 777 peptides that were predicted to be good binders across 11 MHC alleles in a complex-stability assay and tested a selection of 19 epitope-HLA-binding prediction tools against the assay. In this investigation of potential SARS-CoV-2 epitopes we found that current prediction tools vary in performance when assessing binding stability, and they are highly dependent on the MHC allele in question. Designing a COVID-19 vaccine where only a few epitope targets are included is therefore a very challenging task. Here, we present 174 SARS-CoV-2 epitopes with high prediction binding scores, validated to bind stably to 11 HLA alleles.

The Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Skill Trainer (VBLaST-PC©) is a virtual simulator that was developed as a computerized version of the pattern cutting (PC) task in the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery (FLS) system. To establish convergent validity for the VBLaST-PC©, we assessed trainees' learning curves using the cumulative summation (CUSUM) method and compared them with those on the FLS. METHODS Twenty-four medical students were randomly assigned to an FLS training group, a VBLaST training group, or a control group. Fifteen training sessions, 30 min in duration per session per day, were conducted over 3 weeks. All subjects completed pretest, posttest, and retention test (2 weeks after posttest) on both the FLS and VBLaST© simulators. Performance data, including time, error, FLS score, learning rate, learning plateau, and CUSUM score, were analyzed. RESULTS The learning curve for all trained subjects demonstrated increasing performance and a performance plateau. CUSUM analyses showed that five of the seven subjects reached the intermediate proficiency level but none reached the expert proficiency level after 150 practice trials. Performance was significantly improved after simulation training, but only in the assigned simulator. No significant decay of skills after 2 weeks of disuse was observed. Control subjects did not show any learning on the FLS simulator, but improved continually in the VBLaST simulator. CONCLUSIONS Although VBLaST©- and FLS-trained subjects demonstrated similar learning rates and plateaus, the majority of subjects required more than 150 trials to achieve proficiency. Trained subjects demonstrated improved performance in only the assigned simulator, indicating specificity of training.

Since an increasing number of these lesions are detected prenatally, the safety and efficacy of infant resections have been questioned. We reviewed our experience over a 10-year period to evaluate early resection of these lesions. METHODS From January 2001 to August 2009, 75 patients under 1 year of age and weighing <10 kg underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy at two institutions. Patients carried the following diagnoses: 52 had congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, 20 had bronchopulmonary sequestration, and 3 had congenital lobar emphysema. All lesions were confirmed after birth by computed tomography scan. Patient age at operation ranged from 4 days to 11 months and patient weight from 3.1 to 10 kg. RESULTS Seventy-four of 75 lobectomies were thoracoscopically completed. There were 16 upper lobectomies, 1 middle lobectomy, and 55 lower lobectomies. Operative time ranged from 45 to 225 minutes. Hospital length of stay ranged from 1 to 5 days. A subset of 26 patients had surgery younger than 3 months of age and <5 kg, despite being asymptomatic. Their operative time averaged 90 minutes, and mean length of hospital stay was 1.5 days. CONCLUSION Thoracoscopic lobectomy is safe for infants <10 kg and avoids the morbidity associated with thoracotomy. Operating early on younger patients may avoid the inflammatory changes associated with both clinically apparent and subclinical infections, even in patients weighing <5 kg.

A county health ranking and roadmaps program has been established to identify factors associated with disparity in mobility and mortality of COVID-19 in all counties in the United States. The risk factors associated with county-level mortality of COVID-19 with various levels of prevalence are not well understood. METHODS: Using the data obtained from the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps program, this study applied a negative binomial design to the county-level mortality counts of COVID-19 as of August 27, 2020 in the United States. In this design, the infected counties were categorized into three levels of infections using clustering analysis based on time-varying cumulative confirmed cases from March 1 to August 27, 2020. COVID-19 patients were not analyzed individually but were aggregated at the county-level, where the county-level deaths of COVID-19 confirmed by the local health agencies. Clustering analysis and Kruskal–Wallis tests were used in our statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 3125 infected counties were assigned into three classes corresponding to low, median, and high prevalence levels of infection. Several risk factors were significantly associated with the mortality counts of COVID-19, where higher level of air pollution (0.153, P < 0.001) increased the mortality in the low prevalence counties and elder individuals were more vulnerable in both the median (0.049, P < 0.001) and high (0.114, P < 0.001) prevalence counties. The segregation between non-Whites and Whites (low: 0.015, P < 0.001; median:0.025, P < 0.001; high: 0.019, P = 0.005) and higher Hispanic population (low and median: 0.020, P < 0.001; high: 0.014, P = 0.009) had higher likelihood of risk of the deaths in all infected counties. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality of COVID-19 depended on sex, race/ethnicity, and outdoor environment. The increasing awareness of the impact of these significant factors may help decision makers, the public health officials, and the general public better control the risk of pandemic, particularly in the reduction in the mortality of COVID-19.

Many hospital trusts do not currently offer formal mechanisms to ensure the quality of supervision is at a high standard. Our Trust wanted to empower trainees to offer objective feedback on the quality of the supervisors. METHODS We introduced a feedback form sent to all Foundation doctors at our Trust. The questionnaire was designed to identify whether ESs were meeting their responsibilities as defined by the Health Education England South West's Severn Deanery. We collected data throughout the academic year 2017-2018 (Year 1) as a pilot, before rolling out the definitive questionnaire with minor modifications from 2018 to 2019 (Year 2). RESULTS All respondents met with their supervisor within the first month of the placement and 90.7% of the trainees found it easy to meet with their supervisor. The Trust received generally very good feedback for all of its supervisors. Low numbers (4/120 trainees) reported supervisors not engaging with the exception reporting process. CONCLUSION Our Trust provides ESs of a high standard. The authors believe collecting feedback for ESs will achieve three things: 1) Drive up standards through increasing accountability of ESs receiving objective feedback.

Resulting uncertainty is reflected in very different decisions on school closures and reopenings across countries. The aim of this longitudinal cohort study is to assess the extent and patterns of seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in school-attending children repeatedly. It will examine risk factors for infection, relationship between seropositivity and symptoms, and temporal persistence of antibodies. Additionally, it will include testing of school personnel and parents. Methods and analysis The study (Ciao Corona) will enroll a regionally representative, random sample of schools in the canton of Zurich, where 18% of the Swiss population live. Children aged 5 to 16 years, attending classes in primary and secondary schools are invited. Venous blood and saliva samples are collected for SARS-CoV-2 serological testing after the first wave of infections (June/July 2020), in fall (October/November 2020), and after winter (March/April 2021). Venous blood is also collected for serological testing of parents and school personnel. Bi-monthly questionnaires to children, parents and school personnel cover SARS-CoV-2 symptoms and tests, health, preventive behavior, lifestyle and quality of life information. Total seroprevalence and cumulative incidence will be calculated. Hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression models will account for sensitivity and specificity of the serological test in the analyses and for the complex sampling structure, i.e., clustering within classes and schools.

The lung disease was complicated by SARS-COV-2 related pneumonitis in April 2020 and that led to treatment challenges. She was previously seen in multiple private hospitals and labelled as Rheumatoid arthritis. She was being treated with long term steroids and Methotrexate. After her initial presentation to our Rheumatology services, her diagnosis was correctly revised to Systemic Sclerosis with phenotype of CREST. Her treatment was adjusted to Vasodilators and Mycophenolate due to skin and Lung involvement. CASE REPORT - CASE DESCRIPTION: This is a case of 40-year-old Pakistani female who had been having multiple joint pains since 2010. She also experienced severe Raynaud’s. She presented to our Rheumatology clinic in December 2018. Her symptoms included recurrent digital ulcers, tight and tough skin at fingers and Raynaud’s worse during winter months. Her examination confirmed peripheral cyanosis with multiple digital ulcers with superimposed infection, marked sclerodactyly and calcinosis. She was started on Vasodilator therapy including calcium channel blocker and PDE5 inhibitor due to severity of ulceration. Infection was managed with prolonged course of antimicrobial therapy. Her immunology showed positive anti nRNP/Sm. Anti-centromere and anti Scl 70 were negative. Her condition fit description of CREST (Calcinosis, RP, Oesophageal dysmotility, telangiectasia). Her management included weaning off Methotrexate and reduction in the dose of corticosteroids. In February 2019, Respiratory work up showed normal Chest radiograph, High resolution CT chest showing no significant abnormality and FEV1 82%, FVC 86%, and DLCO 77%. Her PASP was 25mmHg. Overall, her condition remained stable over the course of next year. Her medication included Cellcept, low dose prednisolone, hydroxychloroquine, and Sildenafil. More importantly, Digital ulcers have been well controlled with combined vasodilator therapy. In April 2020, she developed SARS-CoV-2 with mild respiratory symptoms and was admitted to a different hospital. Fortunately, she responded well to ward based supportive and symptomatic treatment with no need for respiratory support. Subsequently, she has seen a different respiratory physician and had repeat imaging of chest which has led to dilemma whether the ground glass opacities in both lungs is due to scleroderma lung or COVID-19 related lung disease. She was given high dose prednisolone by the respiratory physician which has been reduced in rheumatology clinic. The new findings on chest imaging are sequelae of SARS-COV-2. CASE REPORT - DISCUSSION: 1. Systemic sclerosis diagnosis was not made for many years even though she has had severe digital ulcers for a long time. She was being managed as Rheumatoid arthritis. Systemic sclerosis remains a difficult disease to diagnose and is still under recognised. . 2. SARS-COV-2 related illness has not affected this patient adversely despite the fact of being on long term maintenance prednisolone of 7.5mg daily dose and Cellcept 2gm. Her cellcept was temporarily stopped during acute illness. . 3. We know that viral pneumonitis can present with typical ground glass opacities in bilateral areas of lungs and differential diagnosis does include connective tissue related lung disease but this lady had no significant respiratory involvement prior to COVID-19 illness and follow up scan will help to decide if this is disease progression or related to viral cause. CASE REPORT - KEY LEARNING POINTS: 1. Continuity of care under same primary team can avoid confusion related to diagnosis and diagnosis related complications. This lady had none, or mild subclinical lung involvement related to systemic sclerosis prior to contracting COVID-19 illness. Her CT chest findings after the episode of SARS-COV-2 were attributed to systemic sclerosis as she was seen by different respiratory team. This continuity is not always possible, but MDT collaboration needs to be improved across hospitals and across various departments. . 2. Systemic sclerosis remains an under diagnosed and under recognized complex rheumatic disorder and more primary care physicians need to be educated so they can appropriately refer these cases to Rheumatology services. 3. Multi-disciplinary collaboration between Rheumatology, Respiratory and other specialties is the key point to manage these complex cases. . 4. This case also highlights an interesting observation that presence of significant immune disorder and immunosuppressant medication does not always equate to worse outcome if patient contracts SARS-COV-2. Supportive care, appropriate observation, and temporary suspension of DMARD in such cases can avoid any further complications.",2020-11-03,"Malik, Dr Saadia; Younas, Dr Hadi; Dhahir, Dr Loay Al",Rheumatol Adv Pract,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607361/,nan

METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, medRxiv and SSRN were searched (May 02, 2020 to August 12, 2020) for non-randomised observational CoViD-19 studies. Event/patient numbers were extracted, comparing ACE inhibitor/ARB treatment (and each separately), to treatment with neither drug, for the outcomes: (a) Likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection; (b) CoViD-19 severity (including hospitalisation, Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU), ventilation); (c) Case-fatality. Risk of bias was assessed (ROBINS-I). Random-effects meta-analysis estimates were pooled. Eighty six studies including 459,755 patients (103,317 with hypertension), were analysed. In patients with hypertension, ACE inhibitor or ARB treatment was not associated with a greater likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 60,141 patients (OR 1.06, 95% CI 0.99-1.14), hospitalisation in 5,925 patients (OR 0.90, 0.62-1.31), ITU in 7,218 patients (OR 1.06, 0.73-1.56), ventilation (or ITU/ventilation/death) in 13,163 patients (OR 0.91, 0.72-1.15) or case-fatality in 18,735 patients with 2,893 deaths (OR 0.75, 0.61-0.92).

We primarily sought to confirm the mechanical properties and cell compatibility of these ZnO NP infused scaffolds. Methods: The antibacterial property of the ZnO NPs was confirmed by hydroxyl radical generation using ultraviolet (U.V.) photocatalysis. Titanium dioxide (TiO2), a well-known antibacterial compound, was used as a positive control (1% w/v) for the ZnO NP-based alginate constructs and their antibacterial efficacies compared. Among the ZnO group, 3D printed gels containing 0.5% and 1% w/v of ZnO were analyzed and compared with manually casted samples via SEM, swelling evaluation, and rheological analysis. Envisioning an in-vivo application for the 3D printed ZnO NP-based alginates, we studied their antibacterial properties by bacterial broth testing, cytocompatibility via live/dead assay, and moisture retention capabilities utilizing a humidity sensor. Results: 3D printed constructs revealed significantly greater pore sizes and enhanced structural stability compared to manually casted samples. For all samples, the addition of ZnO or TiO2 resulted in significantly stiffer gels in comparison with the alginate control. Bacterial resistance testing on Staphylococcus epidermidis indicated the addition of ZnO NPs to the gels decreased bacterial growth when compared to the alginate only gels. Cell viability of STO-fibroblasts was not adversely affected by the addition of ZnO NPs to the alginate gels. Furthermore, the addition of increasing doses of ZnO NPs to the alginate demonstrated increased humidity retention in gels. Discussion: The customization of 3D printed alginates containing antibacterial ZnO NPs leads to an alternative that allows accessible mobility of molecular exchange required for improving chronic wound healing. This scaffold can provide a cost-effective and durable antibacterial treatment option.",2020,"Cleetus, Carol M; Alvarez Primo, Fabian; Fregoso, Gisel; Lalitha Raveendran, Nivedita; Noveron, Juan C; Spencer, Charles T; Ramana, Chinatalapalle V; Joddar, Binata",Int J Nanomedicine,nan,#32764939,nan,nan,nan,nan,220971473.0

Objective To review the recommendations by the international and European national urological associations/societies (UASs) on prioritization strategies for both oncological and nononcological procedures released during the current emergency scenario. Evidence acquisition Each UAS official website was searched between April 8 and 18, 2020, to retrieve any document, publication, or position paper on prioritization strategies regarding both diagnostic and therapeutic urological procedures, and any recommendations on the use of telemedicine and minimally invasive surgery. We collected detailed information on all urological procedures, stratified by disease, priority (higher vs lower), and patient setting (outpatient vs inpatient). Then, we critically discussed the implications of such recommendations for urology practice in both the forthcoming “adaptive” and the future “chronic” phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence synthesis Overall, we analyzed the recommendations from 13 UASs, of which four were international (American Urological Association, Confederation Americana de Urologia, European Association of Urology, and Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand) and nine national (from Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal, The Netherlands, and the UK). In the outpatient setting, the procedures that are likely to impact the future burden of urologists’ workload most are prostate biopsies and elective procedures for benign conditions. In the inpatient setting, the most relevant contributors to this burden are represented by elective surgeries for lower-risk prostate and renal cancers, nonobstructing stone disease, and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Finally, some UASs recommended special precautions to perform minimally invasive surgery, while others outlined the potential role of telemedicine to optimize resources in the current and future scenarios. Conclusions The expected changes will put significant strain on urological units worldwide regarding the overall workload of urologists, internal logistics, inflow of surgical patients, and waiting lists. In light of these predictions, urologists should strive to leverage this emergency period to reshape their role in the future. Patient summary Overall, there was a large consensus among different urological associations/societies regarding the prioritization of most urological procedures, including those in the outpatient setting, urological emergencies, and many inpatient surgeries for both oncological and nononcological conditions. On the contrary, some differences were found regarding specific cancer surgeries (ie, radical cystectomy for higher-risk bladder cancer and nephrectomy for larger organ-confined renal masses), potentially due to different prioritization criteria and/or health care contexts. In the future, the outpatient procedures that are likely to impact the burden of urologists’ workload most are prostate biopsies and elective procedures for benign conditions. In the inpatient setting, the most relevant contributors to this burden are represented by elective surgeries for lower-risk prostate and renal cancers, nonobstructing stone disease, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.",2020-05-31,"Amparore, Daniele; Campi, Riccardo; Checcucci, Enrico; Sessa, Francesco; Pecoraro, Angela; Minervini, Andrea; Fiori, Cristian; Ficarra, Vincenzo; Novara, Giacomo; Serni, Sergio; Porpiglia, Francesco",Eur Urol Focus,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/0144d88cb339012dc1a4b29bbd72962e528baf92.json,nan,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euf.2020.05.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32553544/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405456920301425?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405456920301425,219152980.0

Institutions, involved in training the next generation of ophthalmologists, are using alternative teaching methods to maintain the standard of education. METHODS: We conducted a worldwide survey among physicians, who are actively involved in Ophthalmology-related education, between 3 and 14 April 2020. The expert survey, developed on the basis of literature search and focus group discussions, comprised 23 questions addressing the use of e-learning in Ophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 321 participants from both academic and non-academic institutions worldwide, with variable practice experience and expertise, completed the survey. Before the pandemic, the majority of participants used traditional training modalities, including lectures, grand rounds and journal clubs, and 48% did not use any e-learning. There was a statistically significant increase in the use of all e-learning alternatives during the pandemic (p < 0.001), associated mainly with the availability of e-learning facilities (p < 0.001) and the academic character of institutions (p < 0.001). Zoom® was recognized as the mostly used platform for virtual teaching. Although theoretical teaching may take place, the surgical training of residents/fellows was dramatically reduced. The latter was significantly associated with participants’ perspectives about teaching practices (p < 0.001).

More and more Chinese nurses have been troubled by psychological symptoms (PS). The correlation between PS and SHS is unclear in nurses. The purpose of current study is to investigate the prevalence of SHS and PS in Chinese nurses and the relationship between SHS and PS along with predisposing factors as well as to discuss the feasibility of improving health status and preventing diseases according to PPPM concepts in Chinese nurses. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted with the cluster sampling method among 9793 registered nurses in Foshan city, China. SHS was evaluated with the Suboptimal Health Status Questionnaire-25 (SHSQ-25). Meanwhile, the PS of depression and anxiety were evaluated with Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) self-assessment questionnaires. The relationship between PS and SHS in Chinese nurses was subsequently analyzed. RESULTS: Among the 9793 participants, 6107 nurses were included in the final analysis. The prevalence of SHS in the participants was 74.21% (4532/6107) while the symptoms of depression and anxiety were 47.62% (2908/6107) and 24.59% (1502/6107) respectively. The prevalence of SHS in the participants with depression and anxiety was significantly higher than those without the symptoms of depression (83.3% vs 16.7%, P < 0.001) and anxiety (94.2% vs 5.8%, P < 0.0001). The ratio of exercise habit was significantly lower than that of non-exercise habit (68.8% vs 78.4%, P < 0.001) in SHS group. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence of SHS and PS in Chinese nurses. PS in Chinese nurses are associated with SHS. Physical exercise is a protective factor for SHS and PS so that the exercise should be strongly recommended as a valuable preventive measure well in the agreement with PPPM philosophy.

The clinical picture comprises variable manifestations which involve mainly but not exclusively the musculoskeletal system, and evolve over the person’s lifetime. CASE PRESENTATION: Describing the case of a 20-year-old female with generalized arthro-myalgias, persistent fatigue and troublesome visceral pain, we illustrate how a frequently ignored clinical sign such as joint hypermobility can be the keystone to clarify different simultaneous symptoms. All of the patient’s physical complaints had been investigated separately during her previous medical examinations, and several tests repeatedly gave negative results. The patient received different diagnoses that describe only part of her problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome for visceral pain, fibromyalgia for arthralgias or depression for fatigue. These approaches gave rise to pharmacological or physical treatments which did not improve her quality of life in any way and in some instances worsened the situation.

To generate higher quality, more cost-effective, and less time-consuming measures, it is necessary to explore dual- or multi-method strategy toward sampling optimization, improvement of measurement, and enhancement of efficiency. To justify the proposed dual-method approach, the study has three major objectives. First, it examines the uncertainties associated with different sample sizes by using GIS to generate scenarios that contrast the validity of measurements to aid sampling optimization in auditing. Second, it compares the validity of GIS measures with those generated through Google Street View Auditing (GSVA) by human raters. Third, it further examines the efficiency of the proposed dual-method approach in comparison to the two individual methods. Such investigation generates several novel findings. First, the study presents important evidence to support that GIS measures can offer sampling guidance applicable to the GSVA method. It leads to a recommendation of sampling sizes (5%-20%) for cases in settings with a mixture of affluent and disadvantaged neighborhoods. Results further indicate that different communities and certain individual features and characteristics may demand different sampling practices. Second, the study found that while GSVA is trustworthy for most characteristic variables, especially those that required subjective input, GIS provides well-validated measures for certain objective environmental attributes. Furthermore, the study reports that a dual-method approach of GIS and GSVA had a lower financial and time burden than using GSVA alone and is thus recommended as a comprehensive solution for optimal measurement of an objective built environment in mixed urban neighborhoods.",2020-12-29,"Li, Weimin; Winter, Patricia L; Milburn, Lee-Anne; Padgett, Pamela E",Health & place,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.healthplace.2020.102482; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385801/,230106745.0

It is not still clear why the immune system is not able to efficiently suppress viral replication in a small percentage of patients. It has been documented as pathological conditions affecting the cardiovascular system, strongly associated to atherosclerotic progression, such as heart failure (HF), coronary heart disease (CHD), hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM), could serve as predictive factors for severity and susceptibility during Sars-CoV-2 infection. Atherosclerotic progression, as a chronic inflammation process, is characterized by immune system dysregulation leading to pro-inflammatory patterns, including interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), and IL-1β. Reviewing immune system and inflammation profiles in atherosclerosis and laboratory results reported in severe COVID-19 infections, we hypothesized a pathogenetic correlation. Atherosclerosis may be an ideal pathogenetic substrate for high viral replication ability, leading to adverse outcomes, as reported in patients with cardiovascular factors.

Riboflavin (vitamin B2) activated by ultraviolet (UV) light, produces active oxygen which damages cell membrane and prevents replication of the carrier of diseases (viruses, bacteria, protozoa) in all blood products. The aim of this study was to establish the influence of the process of pathogens photoinactivation using riboflavin and UV rays on the biochemical and functional characteristics of platelet concentrates prepared from ""buffy coat"". METHODS The examination included 80 platelet concentrates prepared from ""buffy coat"", which was separated from whole blood donated by voluntary blood donors around 6 hours from the moment of collection. Concentrates were pooled, filtered and separated unton two groups: one consisted of 10 control units and the other of 10 examined units (pooled platelet concentrates). Examined units of the platelets were treated by riboflavin (35 mL) and UV rays (6.24 J/mL, 265-370 nm) on Mirasol aparature (Caridian BCT Biotechnologies, USA) in approximate duration of 6 min. A total of 35 mL of saline solution was added to the control units. The samples for examining were taken from the control and examined units initially (K0, I0), after the addition of saline (K1) and riboflavin (I1), after illumination (I2), first day of storage (K3, I3) and the fifth day of storage (K4, I4). The following parameters were measured: platelet count and platelet yield, residual erythrocyte and leukocyte count, pH, pO2, pCO2 and bacterial contamination. RESULTS All the measured parameters showed a statistically significant decrease comparing to K0 and I0; all the results of the first day of platelet storage showed statistically significant decrease comparing to K1 and I1, and all the results of the fifth day of platelet storage (K4, I4) showed a statistically significant decrease comparing to K1 and K3 and to I1 and I3. There was no the mentioned difference in the measured parameters between K4 and I4 (the end of storage--the fifth day). All the platelet units were sterile till the seventh day, when the investigation ended. CONCLUSION Platelet concentrates inactivated by riboflavin and UV rays (Mirasol PRT sistem, Caridian BCT, USA) keep all the characteristics assessed by the Guide to the preparation, use and quality assurance of blood components (Council of Europe), during the whole storage period (five days).

This study builds on our prior study based on the scientific premise that YouTube is one of the most effective ways to communicate and mobilize the public in community mitigation to reduce exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). OBJECTIVE: Because of the rapidly changing nature of YouTube in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a follow-up study to document how coverage of preventive behaviors for effective community mitigation has changed. METHODS: A successive sampling design was used to compare coverage of behaviors to mitigate community transmission of COVID-19 in the 100 most widely viewed YouTube videos in January 2020 and March 2020. RESULTS: Videos in the January and March samples were viewed >125 million times and >355 million times, respectively.

The current studies were conducted to evaluate the in vitro SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium, a dendrimer with broad spectrum antimicrobial activity, including against enveloped viruses in in vitro and in vivo models, that is marketed for antiviral and antibacterial applications. We report that astodrimer sodium inhibits replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells when added to cells 1-hour prior to or 1-hour post infection, with 50% effective concentrations reducing virus-induced cytopathic effect (EC50) ranging from 0.090 to 0.742 μM (0.002 to 0.012 mg/mL). The selectivity index (SI) in these assays was as high as 2197. Astodrimer sodium was also effective in a virucidal evaluation when mixed with virus for 1 hour prior to infection of cells (EC50 1.83 μM [0.030 mg/mL]). Results from a time of addition study, which showed infectious virus was below the lower limit of detection at all time points tested, were consistent with the compound inhibiting early virus entry steps. The data were similar for all investigations and were consistent with the potent antiviral activity of astodrimer sodium being due to inhibition of virus-host cell interactions, as previously demonstrated for other viruses. Further studies will confirm if astodrimer sodium binds to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and physically blocks initial association of the virus with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the host cell. Given the in vitro effectiveness and significantly high SI, astodrimer sodium warrants further investigation for potential as a nasally administered or inhaled antiviral agent for SARS-CoV-2 prevention and treatment applications.",2020-08-21,"Paull, Jeremy R.A.; Castellarnau, Alex; Luscombe, Carolyn A.; Fairley, Jacinth K.; Heery, Graham P.",bioRxiv,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/fadaf05375157ac635f2ed1462460eb6577519f5.json,nan,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.20.260190,221276440.0

For hospitalised patients, the daily infectivity was approximately 0.15 early in the epidemic, but fell to 0.0006 in the later part of the epidemic. Despite the lower daily infectivity level for hospitalised patients, the long duration of the hospitalisation led to a greater number of transmissions within hospitals compared with the community in the early part of the epidemic, as estimated by this study.

In turn, response plans are focused on developing and/or increasing inventories of a strain-specific vaccine, antivirals, intensive care beds, mechanical ventilators, and so on. Yet, there is strong and consistent evidence of epidemiologically and clinically important interactions between influenza and secondary bacterial respiratory pathogens, including during the 1918 pandemic.

Hypertension is of particular interest because it is common in adults and there are concerns related to the use of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors in patients with hypertension infected with COVID-19. Levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a protein that facilitates entry of coronavirus into cells, may increase in patients using RAS inhibitors. Thus, chronic use of RAS inhibition could potentially lead to a more severe and fatal form of COVID-19. In this review, we provide a critical review to the following questions: (1) Does hypertension influence immunity or ACE2 expression favoring viral infections? (2) Are the risks of complications in hypertension mediated by its treatment? (3) Is aging a major factor associated with worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19 and hypertension? RECENT FINDINGS: Despite the potential involvement of immune responses in the pathogenesis of hypertension, there is no evidence supporting that hypothesis that hypertension or RAS inhibitors contributes to unfavorable outcomes in viral infections. Future investigations adopting a strict protocol for confirming hypertension status as well as assessing associated comorbidities that may influence outcomes are necessary. From the therapeutic perspective, recombinant ACE2 may serve as a potential therapy, but relevant studies in humans are lacking. Definitive evidence regarding the use of RAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19 is needed; 5 randomized trials examining this issue are currently underway.

However, no study has evaluated the effect of one-lung ventilation on end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). We compared the hemodynamic parameters, blood gases, and ETCO2 during one-lung ventilation with those during conventional two-lung ventilation in a pig model of CPR, to determine the effect of the former on ETCO2. A randomized crossover study was conducted in 12 pigs intubated with double-lumen endobronchial tube to achieve lung separation. During CPR, the animals underwent three 5-min ventilation trials based on a randomized crossover design: left-lung, right-lung, or two-lung ventilation. Arterial blood gases were measured at the end of each ventilation trial. Ventilation was provided using the same tidal volume throughout the ventilation trials. Comparison using generalized linear mixed model revealed no significant group effects with respect to aortic pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, and carotid blood flow; however, significant group effect in terms of ETCO2 was found (P < 0.001). In the post hoc analyses, ETCO2 was lower during the right-lung ventilation than during the two-lung (P = 0.006) or left-lung ventilation (P < 0.001). However, no difference in ETCO2 was detected between the left-lung and two-lung ventilations. The partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), and oxygen saturation (SaO2) differed among the three types of ventilation (P = 0.003, P = 0.001, and P = 0.001, respectively). The post hoc analyses revealed a higher PaCO2, lower PaO2, and lower SaO2 during right-lung ventilation than during two-lung or left-lung ventilation. However, the levels of these blood gases did not differ between the left-lung and two-lung ventilations.

However, studies regarding the risk factors associated with prolonged shedding of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the impact of lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) treatment on viral shedding remain scarce. METHODS: Data were collected from all SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were admitted to isolation wards and had reverse transcription PCR conversion at the No. 3 People's Hospital of Hubei province, China, between 31 January and 9 March 2020. We compared clinical characteristics and SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding between patients initiated with LPV/r treatment and those without. Logistic regression analysis was employed to evaluate the risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding. RESULTS: Of 120 patients, the median age was 52â years, 54 (45%) were male and 78 (65%) received LPV/r treatment. The median duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection from symptom onset was 23â days (interquartile range 18-32â days). Older age (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.05; p=0.03) and the lack of LPV/r treatment (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.10-5.36; p=0.029) were independent risk factors for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. Patients who initiated LPV/r treatment within 10â days from symptom onset, but not initiated from day 11 onwards, had significantly shorter viral shedding duration compared with those without LPV/r treatment (median 19â days versus 28.5â days; log-rank p<0.001).

METHODS: An international cross-sectional survey was administered to 2557 caregivers of children in 17 pediatric emergency departments (EDs) across 6 countries from March 26, 2020, to June 30, 2020. Caregivers were asked to select 1 of 4 choices with which they most agreed regarding a proposed COVID-19 vaccine-approval process, in addition to questions regarding demographic characteristics, the ED visit, and attitudes about COVID-19. Univariate analyses were conducted using the Mann-Whitney U test for comparing non-normally distributed continuous variables, an independent t test for comparing normally distributed continuous variables, and a &#967;2 or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used for determining independent factors associated with caregivers' willingness to accept abridged development of a COVID-19 vaccine. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant. FINDINGS: Almost half (1101/2557; 43%) of caregivers reported that they were willing to accept less rigorous testing and postresearch approval of a new COVID-19 vaccine. Independent factors associated with caregivers' willingness to accept expedited COVID-19 vaccine research included having children who were up to date on the vaccination schedule (odds ratio [OR] = 1.72; 95% CI, 1.29-2.31), caregivers' concern about having had COVID-19 themselves at the time of survey completion in the ED (OR = 1.1; 95% CI, 1.05-1.16), and caregivers' intent to have their children vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine were to become available (OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.54-2.21). Compared with fathers, mothers completing the survey were less likely to approve of changes in the vaccine-development process (OR = 0.641; 95% CI, 0.529-0.775). IMPLICATIONS: Less than half of caregivers in this worldwide sample were willing to accept abbreviated COVID-19 vaccine testing.

Many researchers proposed various anomaly detection techniques to identify events that are inconsistent with past observations. While supervised learning is often used to that end, security experts generally do not have labeled datasets and labeling their data would be excessively expensive. Unsupervised learning, that does not require labeled data should then be used preferably, even if these approaches have led to less relevant results. We introduce in this paper a unified and unique graph representation called security objects’ graphs. This representation mixes and links events of different kinds and allows a rich description of the activities to be analyzed. To detect anomalies in these graphs, we propose an unsupervised learning approach based on auto-encoder. Our hypothesis is that as security objects’ graphs bring a rich vision of the normal situation, an auto-encoder is able to build a relevant model of this situation. To validate this hypothesis, we apply our approach to the CICIDS2017 dataset and show that although our approach is unsupervised, its detection results are as good, and even better than those obtained by many supervised approaches.",2020-06-11,"Leichtnam, Laetitia; Totel, Eric; Prigent, Nicolas; Mé, Ludovic","Detection of Intrusions and Malware, and Vulnerability Assessment",nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/ec33933c06a1b284bdcb98325efe09b16dde57b9.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7338149.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7338149/,nan

The project addressed a gap in the literature on planning for simulations from varying NP specialties and provided feedback from standardized patients on their experiences. A total of 83 students from four specialty tracks received telehealth education. Students then interviewed simulated patients and provided a collaborating report. The students and patients were asked to complete questionnaires to assess the modules and the experience itself. Quantitative descriptive data were gathered, and qualitative themes were obtained from open-ended questions.

However, the primary care system in South Korea is not well established, and primary care research is still in its infancy. This study aimed to show the benefits of regular doctors as primary care providers in South Korea by analyzing the effect of regular doctor visits on emergency room (ER) visits. METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional data on 11,293 adults aged 18 years and over collected from the 2013 Korea Health Panel Survey (beta version 1.0). We classified those participants with and without regular doctors into the treatment and control groups, respectively, and estimated the average treatment effect (ATE) of having a regular doctor on ER visits. We used counterfactual framework and propensity score analysis to adjust for unevenly distributed confounding covariates between treatments and control groups. RESULTS: The estimated conditional ATE of a regular doctor on ER visits was statistically insignificant in the general population (-0.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -2.0 to 1.2) and in the subgroup of patients with hypertension (-1.8%; 95% CI, -4.5 to 0.9). However, in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), the estimated ATE was statistically significant (-5.0; 95% CI, -9.2 to -0.7).

The strong behavioural changes in physical and virtual mobility associated with the pandemic are argued to be particularly significant, representing a 'living lab' in which to explore the possibilities for disintegrating the boundaries of the automobility system, thereby breaking the enduring structures and practices that have enabled automobility to remain largely unchallenged in the policy arena. Change processes previously underway in the automotive industry and in automobility are not impacted equally by the pandemic.

Percutaneous microwave ablation (MWA) showed same benefits and some advantages over radiofrequency ablation (RFA). To date, a disadvantage of both was the not totally predictable size and shape of ablation volume. The aim of this study was to assess feasibility and safety of MWA in nonresectable pancreatic head cancer using a new technology of MW with high power (100 W) and frequency of 2,450 MH. Methods Five patients with pancreatic head cancer treated with percutaneous MWA under ultrasound guidance were retrospectively reviewed. Mean lesion diameter was 27.8 mm (range, 25-32 mm). Follow-up was performed by CT after 1, 3, 6 and, when possible, 12 months. The shape of the ablation volume was evaluated with multiplanar reformatting (MPR) using roundness index (RI): a value near 1 represents a more spherical ablation zone shape, and a value distant from 1 implies an oval configuration. Ablation and procedure times were registered, together with hospital stay. The feasibility, safety and quality of life (QoL) were reported. Results The procedure was feasible in all patients (100%). A spherical shape of ablation zone was achieved in all cases (mean RI =0.97). Mean ablation and procedure time were respectively of 2.48 and 28 minutes. Mean hospital stay was 4 days. No major complications were observed. Minor complications resolved during the hospital stay. An improvement in QoL was observed in all patients despite a tendency to return to preoperative levels in the months following the procedure.

While a valid first step, the conditions of these studies were not representative of commercial swine production. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of feed additives to mitigate the risk of virus-contaminated feed using a model based on real-world conditions. This new model used an ""ice-block"" challenge, containing equal concentrations of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), Seneca-virus A (SVA) and PEDV, larger populations of pigs, representative commercial facilities and environments, along with realistic volumes of complete feed supplemented with selected additives. Following supplementation, the ice block was manually dropped into designated feed bins and pigs consumed feed by natural feeding behavior. After challenge, samples were collected at the pen level (feed troughs, oral fluids) and at the animal level (clinical signs, viral infection, growth rate, and mortality) across five independent experiments involving 15 additives. In 14 of the additives tested, pigs on supplemented diets had significantly greater average daily gain (ADG), significantly lower clinical signs and infection levels, and numerically lower mortality rates compared to non-supplemented controls.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has since spread across the globe and is posing a major burden on society. Measures taken to reduce its spread critically depend on timely and accurate identification of virus-infected individuals by the most sensitive and specific method available, i.e. real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Many commercial kits have recently become available, but their performance has not yet been independently assessed. The aim of this study was to compare basic analytical and clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits from seven different manufacturers (Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical, PrimerDesign, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene). We used serial dilutions of viral RNA to establish PCR efficiency and estimate the 95 % limit of detection (LOD95). Furthermore, we ran a panel of SARS-CoV-2-positive clinical samples (n = 13) for a preliminary evaluation of clinical sensitivity. Finally, we used clinical samples positive for non-coronavirus respiratory viral infections (n = 6) and a panel of RNA from related human coronaviruses to evaluate assay specificity. PCR efficiency was &#8805;96 % for all assays and the estimated LOD95 varied within a 6-fold range. Using clinical samples, we observed some variations in detection rate between kits. Importantly, none of the assays showed cross-reactivity with other respiratory (corona)viruses, except as expected for the SARS-CoV-1 E-gene.

Therefore, a new method for detecting CAM-resistant H. pylori using a minimally invasive technique is strongly desired. We aimed to investigate the clinical usefulness of our newly developed nested polymerase chain reaction-quenching probe (Nested PCR-QP) method using stool specimens. METHODS: We first evaluated our method using a residual solution of the H. pylori stool antigen test for adolescents. Then, we evaluated our method using culture testing for adults. RESULTS: Among 57 middle school students with H. pylori, the Nested PCR-QP test results of 53 (90.3%) were able to be analyzed. A total of 28 students had CAM resistance mutations. We found a genetic mutation in 28 students and no mutation in 23 students, and these results were consistent with those of PCR-direct sequencing. In the 23 adults who were diagnosed with H. pylori infection using the rapid urease test and culture testing, we were able to use Nested PCR-QP for analyzing 21 adults who tested positive in the stool H. pylori antigen test. The results obtained for all 21 adults were consistent with those obtained via the drug susceptibility test. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel method could be useful for non-invasively detecting CAM resistance mutations in H. pylori. This may help select a drug to reduce eradication failure rates against H. pylori.

We report results nationally and separately by state and by age group. Nationally, excess all-cause mortality was 2.4 per 10,000 individuals (about 30% higher than reported COVID deaths in April) and employment displacement was 9.9 per 100 individuals. Across age groups 25 y and older, excess mortality was negatively correlated with economic damage; excess mortality was largest among the oldest (individuals 85 y and over: 39.0 per 10,000), while employment displacement was largest among the youngest (individuals 25 to 44 y: 11.6 per 100 individuals). Across states, employment displacement was positively correlated with excess mortality (correlation = 0.29). However, mortality was highly concentrated geographically, with the top two states (New York and New Jersey) each experiencing over 10 excess deaths per 10,000 and accounting for about half of national excess mortality.

No epidemic has ever been truly predicted, rather than being merely noticed when it was already ongoing. Modelling the future course of an epidemic is similarly tenuous, as exemplified by ominous predictions during the last influenza pandemic leading to exaggerated national responses. The continuous evolution of microorganisms, the introduction of new pathogens into the human population and the interactions of a specific pathogen with the environment, vectors, intermediate hosts, reservoir animals and other microorganisms are far too complex to be predictable. Our environment is changing at an unprecedented rate, and human-related factors, which are essential components of any epidemic prediction model, are difficult to foresee in our increasingly dynamic societies. Any epidemiological model is, by definition, an abstraction of the real world, and fundamental assumptions and simplifications are therefore required. Indicator-based surveillance methods and, more recently, Internet biosurveillance systems can detect and monitor outbreaks of infections more rapidly and accurately than ever before.

Representative population-based data, including asymptomatic individuals for assessing the viral spread and immune response were, however, lacking worldwide. METHODS: Using a panel-based method, we implemented a representative sample of the Luxembourgish population based on age, gender and residency for testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody status in order to define prevalence irrespective of clinical symptoms. Participants were contacted via email to fill an online questionnaire before biosampling at local laboratories. All participants provided information related to clinical symptoms, epidemiology, socioeconomic and psychological assessments and underwent biosampling, rRT-PCR testing and serology for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We included a total of 1862 individuals in our representative sample of the general Luxembourgish population. Of these, 5 individuals had a current positive result for infection with SARS-CoV-2 based on rRT-PCR. Four of these individuals were oligosymptomatic and one was asymptomatic. Overall we found a positive IgG antibody status in 35 individuals (1.97%), of which 11 reported to be tested positive by rRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 previously and showed in addition their IgG positive status also a positive status for IgA. Our data indicate a prevalence of 0.3% for active SARS-CoV-2 infection and an infection rate of 2.15% in the Luxembourgish population between 18 and 79 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Luxembourgish residents show a low rate of acute infections after 7 weeks of confinement and present with an antibody profile indicative of a more recent immune response to SARS-CoV-2.

The ongoing human outbreak of avian H7N9 in China highlights the need for increased surveillance and control in these live-bird markets (LBMs). DISCUSSION: Closure of retail markets in affected areas rapidly decreased human cases to rare, sporadic occurrence, but little attention has been paid thus far to the role of upstream elements of the poultry distribution chain such as wholesale markets. This could partly explain why transmission in poultry populations has not been eliminated more broadly. We present surveillance data from both wholesale live-bird markets (wLBMs) and rLBMs in Shantou, China (from 2004–2006), and call on disease-dynamic theory to illustrate why closing rLBMs has only minor effects on the overall volume of transmission. We show that the length of time birds stay in rLBMs can severely limit transmission there, but that the system-wide effect may be reduced substantially by high levels of transmission upstream of retail markets. SUMMARY: Management plans that minimize transmission throughout the entire poultry supply chain are essential for minimizing exposure to the public. These include reducing stay-time of birds in markets to 1 day, standardizing poultry supply chains to limit transmission in pre-retail settings, and monitoring strains with epidemiological traits that pose a high risk of emergence. These actions will further limit human exposure to extant viruses and reduce the likelihood of the emergence of novel strains by decreasing the overall volume of transmission.",2013-12-16,"Pepin, Kim M; Lloyd-Smith, James O; Webb, Colleen T; Holcomb, Karen; Zhu, Huachen; Guan, Yi; Riley, Steven",BMC Infect Dis,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/d23a5e1b6a5c6036c3e45e7c6d9019a59ddfd6bd.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3878446.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3878446/,nan

Respite care (RC) is a commonly used short-term inpatient service. The provision of RC can serve as a link between home care and institutional care and can help to stabilize the care provided at home. During RC, the everyday functional skills of PwD can be improved or stabilized through systematic mobility training. However, no specific mobility programme exists for this setting. The aim of the DESKK study was to develop and test a mobility training programme for PwD in the RC setting in Germany. METHODS A quasi-experimental pilot study was conducted in a specialized RC centre for PwD. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analysed using a mixed methods design. RESULTS The DESKK mobility programme may be introduced in the RC setting depending on the required time and professional resources. The mobility programme had a high acceptance rate among the staff involved. Ongoing documentation of the mobility exercises were challenging. During their stay (2-4 weeks), the physical function level of the included PwD (n = 20) increased regarding leg strength, gross motor coordination, fine coordination of the fingers and hand strength. CONCLUSIONS The DESKK mobility programme showed a high acceptance rate by the staff and was usable in daily care routine for the most part. These aspects indicate that the programme has the potential to be successfully implemented in the RC setting.

This has created a demand for a substance whose effectiveness has already been demonstrated in a similar scenario. Glycyrrhizin (GZ) is a promising agent against SARS-CoV-2 as its antiviral activity against SARS-CoV has already been confirmed. It is worthwhile to extrapolate from its proven therapeutic effects as there is a high similarity in the structure and genome of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. There are many possible mechanisms through which GZ acts against viruses: increasing nitrous oxide production in macrophages, affecting transcription factors and cellular signalling pathways, directly altering the viral lipid-bilayer membrane, and binding to the ACE2 receptor. In this review, we discuss the possible use of GZ in the COVID-19 setting, where topical administration appears to be promising, with the nasal and oral cavity notably being the potent location in terms of viral load. The most recently published papers on the distribution of ACE2 in the human body and documented binding of GZ to this receptor, as well as its antiviral activity, suggest that GZ can be used as a therapeutic for COVID-19 and as a preventive agent against SARS-CoV-2.",2020,"Chrzanowski, Julian; Chrzanowska, Alicja; Grabon, Wojciech",Phytother. res,nan,#754728,nan,nan,nan,nan,221572639.0

METHODS: From March 4th to April 9th 2020, during the peak of the Italian COVID-19 epidemic, we enrolled a series of 773 patients that performed both non-contrast chest CT and RT-PCR with a time interval no longer than a week due to suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. The diagnostic performance of CT was evaluated according to sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and diagnostic accuracy, considering RT-PCR as the reference standard. An analysis on the patients with discrepant CT scan and RT-PCR result and on the patient with both negative tests was performed. RESULTS: RT-PCR testing showed an overall positive rate of 59.8 %. CT sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 infection were 90.7 % [95 % IC, 87.7%–93.2%], 78.8 % [95 % IC, 73.8−83.2%], 86.4 % [95 % IC, 76.1 %–88.9 %], 85.1 % [95 % IC, 81.0 %–88.4] and 85.9 % [95 % IC 83.2−88.3%], respectively. Twenty-five/66 (37.6 %) patients with positive CT and negative RT-PCR results and 12/245 (4.9 %) patients with both negative tests were nevertheless judged as positive cases by the clinicians based on clinical and epidemiological criteria and consequently treated.

Moreover, we test whether this choice can in turn influence project performance. Using information on more than 5800 World Bank projects for the period 1995-2014, and controlling for characteristics at both country and project level, we find that transparency does influence the probability that a project is implemented locally rather than nationally. More specifically, a one standard deviation decline in transparency increases the probability of a locally implemented project by three percentage points. We also find that a local implementing agency may increase the probability of a successful project only up to a certain level of a country’s transparency.

In addition, non-patient care areas, such as the cafeteria, waiting areas, and playrooms may also be a source of viral infections that can spread in the healthcare setting. These infections may be device-related or transmitted via blood products or organ donation and respiratory droplets, through food including human milk, person to person, or via air ducts, fomites, and surfaces.

Our aim was to investigate, using a bench-top model, the effect of different ventilator settings and positions of the exhalation port and nebulizer on the amount of albuterol delivered to a lung simulator. METHODS A lung model simulating spontaneous breathing was connected to a single-limb NIV ventilator, set in bi-level positive airway pressure (BIPAP) with inspiratory/expiratory pressures of 10/5, 15/10, 15/5, and 20/10 cmH2O, or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) of 5 and 10 cmH2O. Three delivery circuits were tested: a vented mask with the nebulizer directly connected to the mask, and an unvented mask with a leak port placed before and after the nebulizer. Albuterol was collected on a filter placed after the mask and then the delivered amount was measured with infrared spectrophotometry. RESULTS Albuterol delivery during NIV varied between 6.7 ± 0.4% to 37.0 ± 4.3% of the nominal dose. The amount delivered in CPAP and BIPAP modes was similar (22.1 ± 10.1 vs. 24.0 ± 10.0%, p = 0.070). CPAP level did not affect delivery (p = 0.056); in BIPAP with 15/5 cmH2O pressure the delivery was higher compared to 10/5 cmH2O (p = 0.033) and 20/10 cmH2O (p = 0.014). Leak port position had a major effect on delivery in both CPAP and BIPAP, the best performances were obtained with the unvented mask, and the nebulizer placed between the leak port and the mask (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS In this model, albuterol delivery was marginally affected by ventilatory settings in NIV, while position of the leak port had a major effect.

Quantitative LGE signal intensity (SI) was retrospectively compared in regions of fibrosis and emphysema in CPFE patients to similar lung regions in controls. Qualitative comparisons for the presence/extent of reticulation, honeycombing, and traction bronchiectasis between LGE-MRI and HRCT were assessed by two readers in consensus.

Significant differences were found between LGE-MRI and HRCT in the extent of reticulation (12.5, IQR 5.0-20.0 versus 25.0, IQR 15.0-26.3, p = 0.038) and honeycombing (5.0, IQR 0.0-10.0 versus 20.0, IQR 10.6-20.0, p = 0.001) but not traction bronchiectasis (10.0, IQR 5-15 versus 15.0, IQR 5-15, p = 0.878). Receiver operator curve analysis of fibrosis SI compared to similarly located regions in control subjects showed an area under the curve of 0.82 (p = 0.002). A SI cutoff of 19 yielded a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 86% in differentiating fibrosis from similarly located regions in control subjects. CONCLUSION: LGE-MRI can differentiate CPFE from pure emphysema and may be a useful adjunct test to HRCT in patients with suspected CPFE.",2020,"Fleming, Hannah; Clifford, Simon M; Haughey, Aoife; MacDermott, Roisin; McVeigh, Niall; Healy, Gerard M; Lavelle, Lisa; Abbara, Suhny; Murphy, David J; Fabre, Aurelie; McKone, Edward; McCarthy, Cormac; Butler, Marcus; Doran, Peter; Lynch, David A; Keane, Michael P; Dodd, Jonathan D",Eur Radiol Exp,nan,#33141269,nan,nan,nan,nan,226240220.0

In July 2013, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommended the following treatment hierarchy for varicose veins: endothermal ablation, ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy, surgery and compression hosiery. The aim of this paper is to review the randomised controlled trials that have compared endothermal ablation and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy to determine if the level 1 evidence base still supports an ""endothermal ablation first"" strategy for the treatment of varicose veins. METHODS A PubMed and OVID literature search (until 31 January 2015) was performed and randomised controlled trials comparing endothermal ablation and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy were obtained. RESULTS Although anatomical success appeared higher with endothermal ablation than ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy, clinical success and patient-reported outcomes measures were similar. Morbidity and complication rates were very low and not significantly different between endothermal ablation and ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy. Ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy was consistently less expensive that endothermal ablation. CONCLUSIONS All endovenous modalities appear to be successful and have a role in modern day practice. Although further work is required to optimise ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy technique to maximise anatomical success and minimise retreatment, the present level 1 evidence base shows there is no significant difference in clinical important outcomes between ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy and endothermal ablation. As ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy is less expensive, it is likely to be a more cost-effective option in most patients in most healthcare settings.

However, some vaccines produced by conventional means are imperfect in many respects including virulence, safety and efficacy. Moreover, there are no vaccines for some animal diseases. Although genetic engineering has provided new ways of producing effective vaccines, the cost of production for veterinary use is a critical criterion for selecting the method of production and delivery of vaccines. The cost effective production and intrinsic ability to enter cells has made adenovirus vectors a highly efficient tool for delivery of vaccine antigens. Moreover, adenoviruses induce both humoral and cellular immune responses to expressed vaccine antigens.

The presence of more than one pathogen may influence the natural history of acute bronchiolitis in infants. OBJECTIVE To investigate the relevance of dual viral infection in infants with severe bronchiolitis hospitalized in a short-term unit compared with those in a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). STUDY DESIGN One hundred eighty infants <1 year old hospitalized with bronchiolitis in a short-term unit (n = 92) or admitted to the PICU (n = 88) during 2 consecutive winter seasons 2003/2004 and 2004/2005 were evaluated. Molecular biology and standard methods were used to diagnose human respiratory viruses in nasal/throat swabs and nasal aspirates. Clinical data related to host factors and viral prevalence were compared among infants requiring or not PICU support. RESULTS A viral agent was identified in 96.1% of infants with bronchiolitis. Respiratory syncytial virus (70.6% and 73.6%, respectively in the short-term unit and PICU) and rhinovirus (18.5% and 25.3%, respectively in the short-term unit and PICU) were the main detected respiratory viruses in infants hospitalized in both units. No significant difference in viral prevalence was observed between the populations studied. From multivariate analysis, infants with coinfections were 2.7 times (95% CI: 1.2-6.2) more at risk for PICU admission than those with a single infection. Respiratory syncytial virus and rhinovirus were the viruses most frequently identified in mixed infections in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis.

Children aged less than 5 years are especially susceptible to EV71 infections. In addition to the development of vaccines containing the inactivated virus, those containing virus-like particles (VLPs) with repeated antigens also constitute an effective preventive strategy for EV71 infections, with safety and productivity advantages. We previously developed a fusion protein composed with truncated peptides of the EV71 capsid protein, which assembled into spherical particles. This study aimed to assess the immunoprotective effects of this fusion protein as a vaccine candidate in a mouse model of EV71 infection. METHODS: To evaluate the protective effect of fusion protein vaccine candidate, neonatal mice born by immunized female mice, as well as normal neonatal mice immunized twice were infected with EV71 virus. Whereafter, the survival rates, clinical scores and viral loads were measured. RESULTS: The high dosage and booster immunization helped induce specific serum antibodies with high neutralization titers, which were transferred to neonatal mice, thereby facilitating effective resistance towards EV71 infection. An active immune response was also observed in neonatal mice which generated following immunization. CONCLUSIONS: The present results suggest that this fusion protein is a suitable vaccine candidate in treating EV71 infections.",2020-04-22,"Liu, Jiangning; Zhao, Binbin; Xue, Ling; Wu, Jing; Xu, Yanfeng; Liu, Yongdong; Qin, Chuan",Virol J,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/8a7750539981af35bced41e47799c28d648bf8fa.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7178760.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7178760/,nan

Concerned citizens (i.e., the crowd), who are users of the platforms where misinformation appears, can play a crucial role in disseminating fact-checking information and in countering the spread of misinformation. To explore if this is the case, we conduct a data-driven study of misinformation on the Twitter platform, focusing on tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing the spread of misinformation, professional fact checks, and the crowd response to popular misleading claims about COVID-19. In this work, we curate a dataset of false claims and statements that seek to challenge or refute them. We train a classifier to create a novel dataset of 155,468 COVID-19-related tweets, containing 33,237 false claims and 33,413 refuting arguments.Our findings show that professional fact-checking tweets have limited volume and reach. In contrast, we observe that the surge in misinformation tweets results in a quick response and a corresponding increase in tweets that refute such misinformation. More importantly, we find contrasting differences in the way the crowd refutes tweets, some tweets appear to be opinions, while others contain concrete evidence, such as a link to a reputed source. Our work provides insights into how misinformation is organically countered in social platforms by some of their users and the role they play in amplifying professional fact checks.These insights could lead to development of tools and mechanisms that can empower concerned citizens in combating misinformation.

The best delivery models and strategies for broadening access of the vulnerable communities are not fully known. This review identified PrEP programmes reported in the Asia-Pacific, which were classified by delivery models and assessed with a healthcare accessibility framework. METHODS: We performed a literature search on PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE using relevant search terms, manual searched grey literature by visiting relevant websites, examined reference lists and contacted authors for clarification of included PrEP programmes reported through July 2019. A structured table was used for data extraction and summarizing findings in accordance with the five constructs of approachability, acceptability, availability, affordability and appropriateness grounded in the conceptual framework of Healthcare Accessibility. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: This literature search yielded a total of 1308 publications; 119 full texts and abstracts were screened, and 24 publications were included in the review. We identified 11 programmes implemented in seven cities/countries in the Asia-Pacific. A typology of four PrEP delivery models was delineated: (a) fee-based public service model; (b) fee-based community setting model; (c) free public service model; and (d) free community setting model. Overall, the free community setting model was most commonly adopted in the Asia-Pacific, with the strength to boost the capacity of facility and human resources, which enhanced ""approachability"", ""availability"" and ""acceptability."" The free public service model was characterized by components designed in improving ""approachability,"" ""availability"" and ""appropriateness,"" with attention on equity in accessing PrEP. Among free-based models, long-term affordability both to the government and PrEP users would need to be maximized to increase accessibility. Alongside the need for raising awareness, supportive environments and ensuring timely access were means for enabling the development of a sustainable PrEP service. CONCLUSION: PrEP programmes could be classified by delivery models through the five constructs of healthcare accessibility. While the coverage of PrEP remains limited in the Asia-Pacific, an evaluation of these models could benchmark best practices, which would in turn allow effective models to be designed.",2020,"Lau, Janice Yc; Hung, Chi-Tim; Lee, Shui-Shan",J Int AIDS Soc,nan,#32603517,nan,nan,nan,nan,220281121.0

Entry requirements for most models include at least six months on treatment and a suppressed viral load. These models thus systematically exclude newly-initiated patients, who instead experience the conventional model of care, which requires frequent, multiple clinic visits that impose costs on both providers and patients. In this open letter, we argue that the conventional model of care for the first six months on ART is no longer adequate. The highest rates of treatment discontinuation are in the first six-month period after treatment initiation. Newly initiating patients are generally healthier than in the past, with higher CD4 counts, and antiretroviral medications are better tolerated, with fewer side effects and substitutions, making extra clinic visits unnecessary. Improvements in the treatment initiation process, such as same-day initiation, have not been followed by innovations in the early treatment period. Finally, the advent of COVID-19 has made it riskier to require multiple clinic visits. Research to develop differentiated models of care for the first six-month period is needed. Priorities include estimating the minimum number and type of provider interactions and ART education needed, optimizing the timing of a patient’s first viral load test, determining when lay providers can replace clinicians, ensuring that patients have sufficient but not burdensome access to support, and identifying ways to establish a habit of lifelong adherence.",2020-07-29,"Rosen, Sydney; Grimsrud, Anna; Ehrenkranz, Peter; Katz, Ingrid",Gates Open Res,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/ae8945831a9069b42b0a59b1a3ad4b3b39ad5747.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7445417.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32875281/; https://doi.org/10.12688/gatesopenres.13159.1,221375620.0

Recently, there have been many case reports describing the association between COVID‐19 and GBS but much remains unknown about the strength of the association and the features of GBS in this setting. We reviewed 37 published cases of GBS associated with COVID‐19 to summarize this information for clinicians and to determine whether a specific clinical or electrodiagnostic (EDX) pattern is emerging. The mean age (59y), gender (65% male) and COVID‐19 features appear to reflect those of hospitalized COVID‐19 patients early in the pandemic. The mean time from COVID‐19 symptoms to GBS symptoms was 11 days. The clinical presentation and severity of these GBS cases was similar to those with non‐COVID‐19 GBS. The EDX pattern was considered demyelinating in approximately one half of the cases. Cerebrospinal fluid, when assessed, demonstrated albuminocytologic dissociation in 76% of patients and was negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 in all. Serum anti‐ganglioside antibodies were absent in 15 of 17 patients tested. Most patients were treated with a single course of intravenous immunoglobulin, and improvement was noted within 8 weeks in most. In summary, GBS associated COVID‐19 appears to be an uncommon condition with similar clinical and EDX patterns to GBS prior to the pandemic.

Objective: To assess the predictors for effective telepharmacy services on increasing access of patients to care and reducing dispensing errors in community pharmacies. Method: This is a prospective study carried out for 4 months in 52 community pharmacies across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) using disguised direct observation. Multivariable logistic regression was used as a tool to predict factors associated with effective telepharmacy services in improving dispensing safety and increasing access of patients to pharmaceutical care.

Results: Pharmacist recommendations related to COVID-19 at pharmacies with telepharmacy (n = 63,714) versus those without remote services (n = 15,539) were significantly more likely to be (1) contact the nearest testing center (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 7.93), (2) maintain home quarantine (AOR = 5.64), and (3) take paracetamol for fever (AOR = 3.53), all were significant results (p < 0.05).

However, the influence of processes acting on infections during transient phases of host movement is poorly understood. We propose a conceptual framework that explicitly considers infection dynamics during transient phases of host movement to better predict infection spread through spatial host networks. Accounting for host transient movement captures key processes that occur while hosts move between locations, which together determine the rate at which hosts spread infections through networks. We review theoretical and empirical studies of host movement and infection spread, highlighting the multiple factors that impact the infection status of hosts. We then outline characteristics of hosts, parasites and the environment that influence these dynamics. Recent technological advances provide disease ecologists unprecedented ability to track the fine-scale movement of organisms.

h8ze1sqr,nan,WHO,The remaining unknowns: a mixed methods study of the current and global health research priorities for COVID-19,nan,nan,nan,unk,"INTRODUCTION: In March 2020, the WHO released a Global Research Roadmap in an effort to coordinate and accelerate the global research response to combat COVID-19 based on deliberations of 400 experts across the world. Three months on, the disease and our understanding have both evolved significantly. As we now tackle a pandemic in very different contexts and with increased knowledge, we sought to build on the work of the WHO to gain a more current and global perspective on these initial priorities. METHODS: We undertook a mixed methods study seeking the views of the global research community to (1) assess which of the early WHO roadmap priorities are still most pressing; (2) understand whether they are still valid in different settings, regions or countries; and (3) identify any new emerging priorities. RESULTS: Thematic analysis of the significant body of combined data shows the WHO roadmap is globally relevant; however, new important priorities have emerged, in particular, pertinent to low and lower middle-income countries (less resourced countries), where health systems are under significant competing pressures. We also found a shift from prioritising vaccine and therapeutic development towards a focus on assessing the effectiveness, risks, benefits and trust in the variety of public health interventions and measures. Our findings also provide insight into temporal nature of these research priorities, highlighting the urgency of research that can only be undertaken within the period of virus transmission, as well as other important research questions but which can be answered outside the transmission period. Both types of studies are key to help combat this pandemic but also importantly to ensure we are better prepared for the future. CONCLUSION: We hope these findings will help guide decision-making across the broad research system including the multilateral partners, research funders, public health practitioners, clinicians and civil society.",2020,"Norton, Alice; De La Horra Gozalo, Arancha; Feune de Colombi, Nicole; Alobo, Moses; Mutheu Asego, Juliette; Al-Rawni, Zainab; Antonio, Emilia; Parker, James; Mwangi, Wayne; Adhiambo Wesonga, Colette; Marsh, Kevin; Tufet, Marta; Piot, Peter; Lang, Trudie",nan,nan,#690906,nan,nan,nan,nan,220878190.0

It is the largest hospital in Israel and was the first to face coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients in the country at the beginning of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To describe our experience with the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing on our triage method in the emergency department (ED). Our goal was to keep the main hospitalization buildings clean of infection by separating COVID-19 positive patients from COVID-19 negative patients. METHODS: We divided our ED into two separate sections: a regular non-COVID-19 ED and an advanced biological ED. We created clear protocols of triage for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. We reviewed the data of patients admitted to our ED during the month of March and analyzed the results of our triage method in separating COVID-19 positive from negative patients. RESULTS: During the month of March 2020, 7957 patients were referred to our ED. Among them 2004 were referred to the biological ED and 5953 were referred to the regular ED. Of the 2004 patients referred to the biological ED, 1641 (81.8%) were sampled for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction of whom 143 (8.7%) were positive. Only two COVID-19 positive patients unintentionally entered the main clean hospital, making our triage almost full proof. CONCLUSIONS: Our triage method was successful in separating COVID-19 positive from negative patients and maintained the regular hospital clean of COVID-19 allowing treatment continuation of regular non-COVID-19 patients.",2020,"Levy, Yuval; Frenkel Nir, Yael; Ironi, Avinoah; Englard, Hindy; Regev-Yochay, Gili; Rahav, Galia; Afek, Arnon; Grossman, Ehud",Isr Med Assoc J,nan,#972957,nan,nan,nan,nan,221180688.0

Chest radiography through glass walls of an isolation room is a technique that could be immensely useful in the current COVID-19 pandemic. PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to ensure quality and radiation safety while acquiring portable chest radiographs through the glass doors of isolation rooms using an adult anthropomorphic thorax phantom. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sixteen chest radiographs were acquired utilizing different exposure factors without glass, through the smart glass, and through regular glass. Images were scored independently by 2 radiologists for quantum mottle and sharpness of anatomical structures using a 5-point Likert scale. Statistically significant differences in Likert scale scores and entrance surface dose (ESD) between images acquired without glass and through the smart and regular glass were tested. Interreader reliability was also evaluated. RESULTS Compared with conventional radiography, equal or higher mean image quality scores (mottle and anatomical structures) were observed with the smart glass using 100 kVp at 12 mAs and 20 mAs and 125 kVp at 6.3 mAs (100 kVp at 2 mAs and 125 kVp at 3.2 mAs were used for conventional radiography observations). There was no statistically significant difference in the Likert scale scores for image quality and the entrance surface dose for radiographs acquired without glass, through the smart glass, and through regular glass. Backscatter from the smart glass was minimal at a distance of 3 m and was recorded as zero at a distance of 4 m from the x-ray tube outside an isolation room. CONCLUSIONS Good-quality portable chest radiographs can be obtained safely through the smart glass doors of the isolation room. However, this technique does result in minor backscatter radiation. Modifications in the exposure factors (such as increasing milliampere seconds) may be required to optimize image quality while using this technique.",2020-08-07,"Rai, Archana; MacGregor, Kate; Hunt, Bryce; Gontar, Alex; Ditkofsky, Noah; Deva, Djeven; Mathur, Shobhit",Investigative radiology,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1097/rli.0000000000000716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32773486/,221098462.0

These are the viral loop, the hyperinflammatory loop, the non-canonical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) axis loop, and the hypercoagulation loop. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)-2 lights the wick by infecting alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and downregulating the angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2)/angiotensin (Ang-1-7)/Mas1R axis. The viral feedback loop includes evading the host's innate response, uncontrolled viral replication, and turning on a hyperactive adaptative immune response. The inflammatory loop is composed of the exuberant inflammatory response feeding back until exploding in an actual cytokine storm. Downregulation of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas1R axis leaves the lung without a critical defense mechanism and turns the scale to the inflammatory side of the RAS. The coagulation loop is a hypercoagulable state caused by the interplay between inflammation and coagulation in an endless feedback loop. The result is a hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable state producing acute immune-mediated lung injury and eventually, adult respiratory distress syndrome.",2020,"Domingo, Pere; Mur, Isabel; Pomar, Virginia; Corominas, Héctor; Casademont, Jordi; de Benito, Natividad",EBioMedicine,nan,#684307,nan,nan,nan,nan,220834942.0

In this paper, we present our experience in building and deploying an AI system that automatically analyzes CT images and provides the probability of infection to rapidly detect COVID-19 pneumonia. The proposed system which consists of classification and segmentation will save about 30%–40% of the detection time for physicians and promote the performance of COVID-19 detection.

During a deep sunspot minimum (deepest in 100 years) such as we are now witnessing, two space related phenomena could have an effect on the disposition of viral disease and potential pandemics. With the weakening of the magnetic field in the Earth's vicinity, there would be a high flux of mutagenic cosmic rays. These processes would be likely to herald the onset of new pandemics. Neutron counts from Moscow Neutron Monitor show that the flux of cosmic rays reaching Earth in 2019 was indeed at a maximum over a timespan of half a century since 1962. It is of interest to note that immediately prior to the first recorded cases of the novel Corona virus in China a peak of cosmic rays was measured as is indicated by the Huon neutron monitor data. Recent research revealed that estimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor of COVID-19 made with current sequence data point to emergence of the virus in late November 2019 to early December 2019, compatible with the earliest retrospectively confirmed cases and the cosmic ray spike in late November 2019.

sjcib2vi,nan,Medline,Infectious Bronchitis Coronavirus Limits Interferon Production by Inducing a Host Shutoff That Requires Accessory Protein 5b.,10.1128/jvi.00627-16,nan,27279618,unk,"UNLABELLED During infection of their host cells, viruses often inhibit the production of host proteins, a process that is referred to as host shutoff. By doing this, viruses limit the production of antiviral proteins and increase production capacity for viral proteins. Coronaviruses from the genera Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), establish host shutoff via their nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1). The Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus genomes, however, do not encode nsp1, and it has been suggested that these viruses do not induce host shutoff. Here, we show that the Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) does induce host shutoff, and we find that its accessory protein 5b is indispensable for this function. Importantly, we found that 5b-null viruses, unlike wild-type viruses, induce production of high concentrations of type I interferon protein in vitro, indicating that host shutoff by IBV plays an important role in antagonizing the host's innate immune response. Altogether, we demonstrate that 5b is a functional equivalent of nsp1, thereby answering the longstanding question of whether lack of nsp1 in gammacoronaviruses is compensated for by another viral protein. As such, our study is a significant step forward in the understanding of coronavirus biology and closes a gap in the understanding of some IBV virulence strategies. IMPORTANCE Many viruses inhibit protein synthesis by their host cell to enhance virus replication and to antagonize antiviral defense mechanisms. This process is referred to as host shutoff. We studied gene expression and protein synthesis in chicken cells infected with the important poultry pathogen infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). We show that IBV inhibits synthesis of host proteins, including that of type I interferon, a key component of the antiviral response. The IBV-induced host shutoff, however, does not require degradation of host RNA. Furthermore, we demonstrate that accessory protein 5b of IBV plays a crucial role in the onset of host shutoff. Our findings suggest that inhibition of host protein synthesis is a common feature of coronaviruses and primarily serves to inhibit the antiviral response of the host.",2016,"Kint, Joeri; Langereis, Martijn A; Maier, Helena J; Britton, Paul; van Kuppeveld, Frank J; Koumans, Joseph; Wiegertjes, Geert F; Forlenza, Maria",Journal of virology,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00627-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27279618/,4764851.0
zkss10vv,nan,WHO,A comparison of anesthetic protective barriers for the management of COVID-19 pediatric patients,nan,nan,nan,unk,"BACKGROUND: Barrier techniques, such as plastic sheets or intubation boxes, are purported to offer additional protection for healthcare workers. AIMS: To assess the functionality, perceived safety, droplet protection and aerosol protection of several barrier techniques. METHODS: Firstly, a simulation study with 12 different laryngoscopists was conducted to assess the time taken to perform an intubation (via direct laryngoscopy, via video laryngoscopy and via a bougie) with four different barrier techniques (personal protective equipment only, a plastic sheet, a tented plastic sheet and an intubation box). Secondly, a cough at the time of intubation was simulated using ultraviolet dye to assess the spread of droplets; and thirdly, smoke was used to assess the spread of aerosols. RESULTS: Intubation time using the box was non-inferior to using no barrier. Based on subjective ratings by the laryngoscopists, the most functional technique was no barrier followed by the intubation box, then the tented sheet, then the plastic sheet. The technique that conferred the highest feeling of safety to the laryngoscopists was the intubation box, followed by the tented sheet, then no barrier and then the plastic sheet. All the barriers prevented the ultraviolet dye contaminating the head and torso of the laryngoscopist. Smoke remained within the intubation box if plastics sheets were used to cover the openings and suction was ineffective at clearing it. With no barrier in place, smoke was effectively cleared away from the patient in a theatre with laminar flow but tended to spread up toward the laryngoscopist in a room without laminar flow. CONCLUSIONS: A well-designed intubation box is an effective barrier against droplets and is non-inferior to no barrier in relation to intubation time.However, a box interferes with laminar flow in theatres with formal ventilation systems and may result in accumulation of aerosols if it is completely enclosed.",2020,"Lee-Archer, Paul; Boyd, Daniel; Du, Trung; Elliott, Robert; Graydon, Cameron; Paterson, Neil; Morawska, Lidia",Paediatr. anaesth,nan,#957866,nan,nan,nan,nan,227525063.0

The objective of this study was to assess how efficiently primary care physicians at the screening clinic were able to predict whether a patient had COVID-19 or not, based on their symptom-based assessment alone. The current study is a cross-sectional retrospective observational study. This study was conducted at a single-center, tertiary care setting with a dedicated COVID-19 facility in a metropolitan city in eastern India. Participants are all suspected COVID-19 patients who presented themselves to this center during the outbreak from 1 August 2020 to 30 August 2020. Patients were referred to the Cough Clinic from the various outpatient departments of the hospital or from smaller satellite centers located in different parts of the city and other dependent geographical areas. The main outcome(s) and measure(s) is to study whether outcome of confirmatory test results can be predicted accurately by history taking alone. From 01 August 2020 to 30 Aug 2020, 511 patients with at least one symptom suggestive of COVID-19 reported to screening clinic. Out of these, 65.4% were males and 34.6% were females. Median age was 45 years with range being 01 to 92 years. Fever was seen in 70.4% while cough was present in 22% of cases. Overall positivity for SARS-CoV-2 during this period in this group was 54.21%. At 50% pre-test probability, the sensitivity of trained doctors working at the clinic, in predicting positive cases based on symptoms alone, was approximately 74.7%, and specificity for the same was 58.12%. The positive predictive value of the doctors' assessment was 67.87%, and the negative predictive value was 66.02%.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of inhaled nebulised interferon beta-1a (SNG001) for the treatment of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. METHODS: We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 pilot trial at nine UK sites. Adults aged 18 years or older and admitted to hospital with COVID-19 symptoms, with a positive RT-PCR or point-of-care test, or both, were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive SNG001 (6 MIU) or placebo by inhalation via a mouthpiece daily for 14 days. The primary outcome was the change in clinical condition on the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI) during the dosing period in the intention-to-treat population (all randomised patients who received at least one dose of the study drug). The OSCI is a 9-point scale, where 0 corresponds to no infection and 8 corresponds to death. Multiple analyses were done to identify the most suitable statistical method for future clinical trials. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events for 28 days. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrialsregister.eu (2020-001023-14) and ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04385095); the pilot trial of inpatients with COVID-19 is now completed. FINDINGS: Between March 30 and May 30, 2020, 101 patients were randomly assigned to SNG001 (n=50) or placebo (n=51). 48 received SNG001 and 50 received placebo and were included in the intention-to-treat population. 66 (67%) patients required oxygen supplementation at baseline: 29 in the placebo group and 37 in the SNG001 group. Patients receiving SNG001 had greater odds of improvement on the OSCI scale (odds ratio 2·32 [95% CI 1·07-5·04]; p=0·033) on day 15 or 16 and were more likely than those receiving placebo to recover to an OSCI score of 1 (no limitation of activities) during treatment (hazard ratio 2·19 [95% CI 1·03-4·69]; p=0·043). SNG001 was well tolerated. The most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse event was headache (seven [15%] patients in the SNG001 group and five [10%] in the placebo group). There were three deaths in the placebo group and none in the SNG001 group.

The governments alone cannot prevent the spread of this pandemic without creating a sensitive public opinion and cooperation. Therefore, this study analyzed the knowledge, behavior, and precautionary measures taken by the general public to protect themselves from COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY For this purpose, snowball sampling technique was used to collect data from 401 respondents through an online survey in the Punjab province of Pakistan. A Multivariate Probit Model was used to determine the factors affecting the choice of precautionary measures to avoid COVID-19 infection. RESULTS Majority of the respondents (58.1%) belonged to urban areas in this study. The urban respondents had higher knowledge about Coronavirus disease as compared to rural respondents. Similarly, the hygienic behavior of urban respondents was better than rural respondents. But unavailability of hygienic material (mask and hand sanitizer) was the main problem faced by the general public. Public transportation was considered the most risk-prone place to COVID-19 by the respondents. Majority of the respondents perceived medium to highest risk from COVID-19, and it was found one of the most influential factors affecting the adoption of precautionary measures along with knowledge of this pandemic.

However, the therapeutic efficiency is unsatisfactory, particularly in East Asia. Such inefficiency might be a result of the short half‐life, relatively low local concentration and strong side‐effects of interferons. Frequent and repeated injection is also a big burden for patients. In the present study, a single dose of vector‐delivered IFNα1 was tested for its anti‐HBV effects. METHODS: Adeno‐associated viral vector (AAV‐IFNα1) was generated to deliver the IFNα1 gene into hepatocytes. IFNα1, hepatitis B surface (HBsAg) and e (HBeAg) antigens were measured by enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and/or western blotting. The level of viral DNA was measured by quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: AAV‐IFNα1 effectively transduced HBV‐producing cells (HepAD38) and mouse hepatocytes, where IFNα1 was expressed in a stable manner. Both intracellular and extracellular HBsAg and HBeAg were significantly reduced in vitro. In the HBV‐producing mice, the concentration of IFNα1 in the liver was eight‐fold higher than that in plasma. Compared with control groups, HBeAg/HBsAg antigen levels were reduced by more than ten‐fold from day 1–5, and dropped to an undetectable level on day 9 in the AAV‐IFNα1 group. Concurrently, the level of viral DNA decreased over 30‐fold for several weeks. CONCLUSIONS: A single dose administration of AAV‐IFNα1 viral vector displayed prolonged transgene expression and superior antiviral effects both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the use of AAV‐IFNα1 might be a potential alternative strategy for anti‐HBV therapy.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the most commonly prescribed drugs for the treatment of depressive disorders. Some people share information about their experiences with antidepressants on social media platforms such as Twitter. Analysis of the messages posted by Twitter users under SSRI treatment can yield useful information on how these antidepressants affect users’ behavior. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to compare the behavioral and linguistic characteristics of the tweets posted while users were likely to be under SSRI treatment, in comparison to the tweets posted by the same users when they were less likely to be taking this medication. METHODS: In the first step, the timelines of Twitter users mentioning SSRI antidepressants in their tweets were selected using a list of 128 generic and brand names of SSRIs. In the second step, two datasets of tweets were created, the in-treatment dataset (made up of the tweets posted throughout the 30 days after mentioning an SSRI) and the unknown-treatment dataset (made up of tweets posted more than 90 days before or more than 90 days after any tweet mentioning an SSRI). For each user, the changes in behavioral and linguistic features between the tweets classified in these two datasets were analyzed. 186 users and their timelines with 668,842 tweets were finally included in the study. RESULTS: The number of tweets generated per day by the users when they were in treatment was higher than it was when they were in the unknown-treatment period (P=.001). When the users were in treatment, the mean percentage of tweets posted during the daytime (from 8 AM to midnight) increased in comparison to the unknown-treatment period (P=.002). The number of characters and words per tweet was higher when the users were in treatment (P=.03 and P=.02, respectively). Regarding linguistic features, the percentage of pronouns that were first-person singular was higher when users were in treatment (P=.008). CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral and linguistic changes have been detected when users with depression are taking antidepressant medication. These features can provide interesting insights for monitoring the evolution of this disease, as well as offering additional information related to treatment adherence.

A second aim was to investigate any differences between cyanotic and non-cyanotic children in relation to cerebral and splanchnic oxygen saturation during flight ≥ 5000 feet. The variability of the cerebral and splanchnic Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) sensors was evaluated. DESIGN NIRS was used to measure rSO2-C and rSO2-A during transport of critically ill children in air ambulance. rSO2 data was collected and stored by the NIRS monitor and extracted and analyzed off-line after the transport. Prior to evaluation of the NIRS signals all zero and floor-effect values were removed. SETTING The Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) at Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. PATIENTS In total, 44 critically ill children scheduled for inter-hospital transport by a specialized pediatric transport team were included in the study between January 2014 and January 2019 (convenience sampling). INTERVENTION No interventions were conducted. MEASUREMENTS All study patients were monitored with a cerebral NIRS-sensor placed over the forehead and an abdominal NIRS-sensor placed in the infra-umbilical area for cerebral and splanchnic regional oxygen saturation monitoring, rSO2-C and rSO2-A, respectively. MAIN RESULTS Complete rSO2-C and rSO2-A data was obtained in 39 patients. Median age was 12 days. Cyanotic congenital heart malformations were present in 9 patients (23%). In 22 patients (56%) rSO2-C decreased at altitude ≥ 5000 feet and in 24 patients (61%) rSO2-A decreased at altitude ≥ 5000 feet compared to baseline (p<0.0001).

A few molecularly proven SARS-CoV-2 cases of symptomatic reinfection are currently known worldwide, with a resolved first infection followed by a second infection after a 48 to 142-day intervening period. We report a multiple-component study of a clinically severe and prolonged viral shedding COVID-19 case in a teenager Portuguese female. She had two hospitalisations, a total of 19 RT-PCR tests, mostly positive, and criteria for releasing from home isolation at the end of 97 days. Methods. The viral genome was sequenced in seven serial samples and in the diagnostic sample from an infected close relative. A human genome-wide array (>900K) was screened on the seven samples, and in vitro culture was conducted on isolates from three late samples. Results. The patient had co-infection by two SARS-CoV-2 strains, affiliated in distinct clades and diverging by six variants. The 20A lineage was absolute at the diagnosis (shared with a cohabitating relative), but nine days later the 20B lineage had 3% frequency, and two months later the 20B lineage had 100% frequency. The 900K profiles confirmed the identity of the patient in the serial samples, and allowed us to infer that she had polygenic risk scores for hospitalization and severe respiratory disease within the normal distributions for a Portuguese population cohort.

Chest CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia have been investigated mostly in China, and there is very little information available on the radiological findings occurring in other populations. In this study, we aimed to describe the characteristics of chest CT findings in confirmed cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in an Iranian population, based on a time classification. METHODS: Eighty-nine patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, confirmed by a real-time RT-PCR test, who were admitted to non-ICU wards and underwent a chest CT scan were retrospectively enrolled. Descriptive evaluation of radiologic findings was performed using a classification based on the time interval between the initiation of the symptoms and chest CT-scan. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 58.0 years, and the median time interval from the onset of symptoms to CT scan evaluation was 7 days. Most patients had bilateral (94.4%) and multifocal (91.0%) lung involvement with peripheral distribution (60.7%). Also, most patients showed involvement of all five lobes (77.5%). Ground-glass opacities (GGO) (84.3%), and mixed GGO with consolidation (80.9%) were the most common identified patterns. We also found that as the time interval between symptoms and CT scan evaluation increased, the predominant pattern changed from GGO to mixed pattern and then to elongated-containing and band-like-opacities-containing pattern; on the other hand, the percentage of lung involvement increased.

Preventive treatment has an important role to control and avoid the spread of severe respiratory disease, but often is difficult to obtain and sometimes cannot be effective to reduce the risk of deterioration of the underlining lung pathology. In order to define an effective and safe treatment for SARS-CoV-2-associated disease, we provide considerations on the actual treatments, on how to avoid complications and the undesirable side effects related to them and to select and apply earlier the most appropriate treatment. Approaching to treat severe respiratory disease in infants and children, the risks related to the development of atelectasis starting invasive or non-invasive ventilation support and the risk of oxygen toxicity must be taken into serious consideration. For an appropriate and effective approach to treat severe pediatric respiratory diseases, two main different strategies can be proposed according to the stage and severity of the patient conditions: patient in the initial phase and with non-severe lung pathology and patient with severe initial respiratory impairment and/or with delay in arrival to observation.

COMMENTARY: During the economic crisis in Greece, accessibility to healthcare services has been impacted, particularly for people with low income. However, this fact has not been systematically analyzed in conjunction with an observed increase in use of OTC medicines. Gaining a better understanding of the reasons leading to self-care may help to answer additional questions. Further research is needed to assess the gap between self-care and medically assisted care/treatment by designing pilot monitoring actions and focusing on behaviours related to OTC medicine use.

Post-operative shared care with community optometrists can reduce the need for hospital follow-up appointments. AIMS: Eight years after the introduction of a shared-care pathway, we wished to quantify the proportion of patients discharged to the community for post-operative follow-up, and the number that re-present to the hospital due to cataract-related issues. METHODS: We collected data on all patients who underwent cataract surgery in our centre over a three month period. Electronic patient records were used to establish whether the patient was discharged on the day of surgery, and whether they re-attended the department post-operatively. Post-operative complications were recorded. RESULTS: 394 cataract procedures were carried out over the three months. 369 patients were discharged to an optometrist for their post-operative care. Of those, 38 were re-referred or re-presented to the hospital ophthalmic service. 21 of these had a post-operative complication. Complications included seven cases of post-operative uveitis, 5 patients with cystoid macular oedema, one retinal detachment and one retained lens fragment.

With this study we aimed to assess glucose, glycemic gap (GlyG) and insulin secretion/sensitivity measures in patients with Covid-19. Materials and Methods: We studied, upon admission, 157 patients with Covid-19 (84: in wards and 73: in intensive care units; ICU); 135 had no history of diabetes. We measured blood glucose upon admission as well as glycated hemoglobin (A1c), plasma insulin and C-peptide. We calculated the GlyG and the Homeostasis Model Assessment 2 (HOMA2) estimates of steady state beta cell function (HOMA2%B) and insulin sensitivity (HOMA2%S). Statistical assessment was done with analysis or the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: Compared to patients in the wards without diabetes, patients with diabetes in the wards, as well as patients in the ICU (without or with diabetes) had higher admission glycemia. The GlyG was significantly higher in patients without diabetes in the ICU compared to patients without diabetes in the wards, while HOMA2%B based on glucose and insulin was significantly higher in the ICU patients compared to patients in the wards. Of all the parameters, HOMA2%S based on C-peptide/glucose was higher in survivors (n = 133). Conclusions: In our series of patients with Covid-19, a substantial number of patients with and without diabetes had admission hyperglycemia and those who were critically ill may have had compromised insulin secretion and lowered sensitivity to insulin.

Moreover, it increases patients' satisfaction with the surgery. In this study, we present a simple approach involving the safe placement of intercostal catheter (ICC) after single port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) anatomic resection and we evaluate postoperative analgesic function with and without it. METHODS We identified patients who underwent single port anatomic resection with ICC placed intraoperatively as a route for continuous postoperative levobupivacaine (0.5%) administration and retrospectively compared them with a group of single port anatomic resection patients without ICC. The operation time, postoperative day 0, 1, 2, 3 and discharge day pain score, triflow numbers, narcotic requirements, drainage duration and post-operative hospital stay were compared. RESULTS In total, 78 patients were enrolled in the final analysis (39 patients with ICC and 39 without). We found patients with ICC had less pain sensation numerical rating scale (NRS) on postoperative day 0, 1 (P=0.023, <0.001) and better triflow performance on postoperative day 1 and 2 (P=0.015, 0.032). In addition, lower IV form morphine usage frequency and dosage (P=0.009, 0.017), shorter chest tube drainage duration (P=0.001) and postoperative stay (P=0.005) were observed in the ICC group.

However, there is little systematic tracking of global research and development. We present research on investments into infectious diseases research from funders in the G20 countries across an 18-year time period spanning 2000-17, comparing amounts invested for different conditions and considering the global burden of disease to identify potential areas of relative underfunding. METHODS: The study examined research awards made between 2000 and 2017 for infectious disease research from G20-based public and philanthropic funders. We searched research databases using a range of keywords, and open access data were extracted from funder websites. Awards were categorised by type of science, specialty, and disease or pathogen. Data collected included study title, abstract, award amount, funder, and year. We used descriptive statistics and Spearman's correlation coefficient to investigate the association between research investment and disease burden, using Global Burden of Disease 2017 study data. FINDINGS: The final 2000-17 dataset included 94â074 awards for infectious disease research, with a sum investment of $104·9 billion (annual range 4·1 billion to 8·4 billion) and a median award size of $257â176 (IQR 62â562-770â661). Pre-clinical research received $61·1 billion (58·2%) across 70â337 (74·8%) awards and public health research received $29·5 billion (28·1%) from 19â197 (20·4%) awards. HIV/AIDS received $42·1 billion (40·1%), tuberculosis received $7·0 billion (6·7%), malaria received $5·6 billion (5·3%), and pneumonia received $3·5 billion (3·3%). Funding for Ebola virus ($1·2 billion), Zika virus ($0·3 billion), influenza ($4·4 billion), and coronavirus ($0·5 billion) was typically highest soon after a high-profile outbreak. There was a general increase in year-on-year investment in infectious disease research between 2000 and 2006, with a decline between 2007 and 2017. Funders based in the USA provided $81·6 billion (77·8%). Based on funding per 2017 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), HIV/AIDS received the greatest relative investment ($772 per DALY), compared with tuberculosis ($156 per DALY), malaria ($125 per DALY), and pneumonia ($33 per DALY). Syphilis and scabies received the least relative investment (both $9 per DALY). We observed weak positive correlation (r=0·30) between investment and 2017 disease burden. INTERPRETATION: HIV research received the highest amount of investment relative to DALY burden. Scabies and syphilis received the lowest relative funding. Investments for high-threat pathogens (eg, Ebola virus and coronavirus) were often reactive and followed outbreaks. We found little evidence that funding is proactively guided by global burden or pandemic risk. Our findings show how research investments are allocated and how this relates to disease burden and diseases with pandemic potential.

We assessed several hemodynamic variables to explore risk factors in the postoperative rupture process. MATERIALS AND METHODS We enrolled 10 patients with intracranial aneurysms, treated with flow diverters between September 2014 and December 2018, who experienced postoperative aneurysm rupture (postoperative aneurysm rupture group). We matched these subjects 1:2 with 20 patients with postoperative unruptured (postoperative unruptured group) intracranial aneurysms based on clinical and morphologic factors. Using computational fluid dynamics, we assessed hemodynamic changes pre- and posttreatment between the 2 groups on a number of qualitative and quantitative parameters. RESULTS In the postoperative aneurysm rupture group, the proportion of patients with aneurysms with an unstable flow pattern increased to 60.0% after treatment, while the proportion in the postoperative unruptured group decreased to 20.0%, a significant difference between the 2 groups (P = .028). Energy loss in the postoperative unruptured group decreased after treatment but increased in the postoperative aneurysm rupture group. The reduction ratio of energy loss showed a significant difference between the 2 groups (22.73% ± 53.59% for postoperative unruptured versus -158.81% ± 183.95% for postoperative aneurysm rupture, P = .02). Other parameters and changes of pre- and posttreatment hemodynamic parameters showed no significant difference between 2 groups.

METHODS In the present prospective cohort study, 20 patients with long-standing, insulin-dependent T2DM and a body mass index (BMI) between 25 and 35 kg/m underwent laparoscopic RYGB. Body mass index, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and DPN [quantified by the Neuropathy Symptom Score (NSS) and the Neuropathy Deficit Score (NDS)] were investigated. RESULTS Six months after surgery, the preoperative BMI of 32.8 ± 2.1 kg/m (mean ± standard deviation) dropped to 25.6 ± 2.5 kg/m (P < 0.001). Preoperative HbA1c levels decreased from 8.5 ± 1.2% to 7.1 ± 1.2% (P < 0.001), with 15% of patients having a normalized HbA1c level lower than 6.2%. Of 12 patients with documented DPN, the median NSS was 8 (range, 0-10) preoperatively and 0 (range, 0-9) postoperatively (P = 0.004), with 8 patients scoring an NSS of 0. The median NDS was 6 (range, 2-8) preoperatively and 4 (range, 0-8) postoperatively (P = 0.027), with 1 patient scoring an NDS of 0. All patients had an improvement or normalization in either 1 or both scores. CONCLUSIONS As expected, BMI and HbA1c levels improved significantly after RYGB. More interestingly, neuropathy scores, such as NSS and NDS, improved significantly early after surgery. Symptomatic neuropathy was completely reversible in 67% of the patients. These findings add further evidence to the fact that RYGB might be a valuable treatment option not only for improving glycemic control but also for reducing diabetes-associated comorbidities, such as DPN. This points to a complex metabolic effect of RYGB that exceeds glucose normalization. However, the results still need to be confirmed in controlled trials.",2013,"Müller-Stich, Beat P; Fischer, Lars; Kenngott, Hannes G; Gondan, Matthias; Senft, Jonas; Clemens, Gabriella; Nickel, Felix; Fleming, Thomas; Nawroth, Peter P; Büchler, Markus W",Annals of surgery,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0b013e3182a618b2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23979278/,25260965.0

The current spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection presents the urgent need to understand the complex pathogen-host interplay for effective control of the virus. SARS-CoV-2 reorganizes the host cytoskeleton for efficient cell entry and controls host transcriptional processes to support viral protein translation. The virus also dysregulates innate cellular defenses using various structural and nonstructural proteins. This results in substantial but delayed hyperinflammation alongside a weakened interferon (IFN) response. We provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 and its uniquely aggressive life cycle and discuss the interactions of various viral proteins with host signaling pathways.

In this work, we studied the electrophysiologic maturation of PRPs throughout the differentiation process. Methods Human embryonic stem cells were differentiated into PRPs and whole-cell recordings were performed for electrophysiologic characterization at days 0, 30, 60, and 90 along with quantitative PCR analysis to characterize the expression level of various ion channels, which shape the electrophysiologic response. Finally, to characterize the electrically induced calcium currents, we employed calcium imaging (rhod4) to visualize intracellular calcium dynamics in response to electrical activation. Results Our results revealed an early and steady presence (approximately 100% of responsive cells) of the delayed potassium rectifier current. In contrast, the percentage of cells exhibiting voltage-gated sodium currents increased with maturation (from 0% to almost 90% of responsive cells at 90 days). Moreover, calcium imaging revealed the presence of voltage-gated calcium currents, which play a major role in vision formation. These results were further supported by quantitative PCR analysis, which revealed a significant and continuous (3- to 50-fold) increase in the expression of various voltage-gated channels concomitantly with the increase in the expression of the photoreceptor marker CRX. Conclusions These results can shed light on the electrophysiologic maturation of neurons in general and PRP in particular and can form the basis for devising and optimizing cell replacement-based vision restoration strategies.",2020-09-01,"Schick, Revital; Farah, Nairouz; Markus, Amos; Korngreen, Alon; Mandel, Yossi",Investigative ophthalmology & visual science,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.61.11.44; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991686/,222167998.0

Proximity labeling utilizes enzymes that generate reactive radicals to covalently tag neighboring proteins. The tagged endogenous proteins can then be isolated for further analysis by MS. To analyze protein-protein interactions or identify components that localize to discrete subcellular compartments, spatial expression is achieved by fusing the enzyme to specific proteins or signal peptides that target to particular subcellular regions. Although these technologies have only been introduced recently, they have already provided deep insights into a wide range of biological processes.

Single cases and small series were reported from 13 countries, the majority from Europe (79.4%) and especially from Italy (30.9%). SARS-CoV-2 infection was demonstrated by nasopharyngeal swab (85.7%) and serology (14.3%). Median time between COVID-19 and GBS onset in 36 patients was 11.5 days (IQR: 7.7-16). The most common clinical features were: limb weakness (76.2%), hypoareflexia (80.9 %), sensory disturbances (66.7 %) and facial palsy (38.1%). Dysautonomia occurred in 19%, respiratory failure in 33.3% and 40.5% of patients were admitted in intensive care unit. Most patients (71.4%) had the classical clinical presentation but virtually all GBS variants and subtypes were reported. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) albumin-cytological dissociation was found in 28/36 (77.8%) and PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was negative in 25/25 patients. Electrodiagnosis was demyelinating in 80.5% and levels 1 and 2 of Brighton criteria of diagnostic certainty, when applicable, were fulfilled in 94.5% patients. Antiganglioside antibodies were positive in only 1/22 patients. Treatments were intravenous immunoglobulin and/or plasma exchange (92.8%) with, at short-time follow-up, definite improvement or recovery in 62.1% of patients. One patient died. In conclusion, the most frequent phenotype of GBS in SARS-CoV-2 infection is the classical sensorimotor demyelinating GBS responding to the usual treatments. The time interval between infectious and neuropathic symptoms, absence of CSF pleocytosis and negative PCR support a postinfectious mechanism. The abundance of reports suggests a pathogenic link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and GBS but a case-control study is greatly needed.",2020,"Uncini, Antonino; Vallat, Jean-Michel; Jacobs, Bart C",J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,nan,#733139,nan,nan,nan,nan,221360770.0

It has been reported in cases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as in morbidly obese patients with healthy lungs. The authors hypothesized that complete airway closure was highly prevalent in obese ARDS and influenced the calculation of respiratory mechanics. METHODS In a post hoc pooled analysis of two cohorts, ARDS patients were classified according to body mass index (BMI) terciles. Low-flow inflation pressure-volume curve and partitioned respiratory mechanics using esophageal manometry were recorded. The authors' primary aim was to compare the prevalence of complete airway closure according to BMI terciles. Secondary aims were to compare (1) respiratory system mechanics considering or not considering complete airway closure in their calculation, and (2) and partitioned respiratory mechanics according to BMI. RESULTS Among the 51 patients analyzed, BMI was less than 30 kg/m in 18, from 30 to less than 40 in 16, and greater than or equal to 40 in 17. Prevalence of complete airway closure was 41% overall (95% CI, 28 to 55; 21 of 51 patients), and was lower in the lowest (22% [3 to 41]; 4 of 18 patients) than in the highest BMI tercile (65% [42 to 87]; 11 of 17 patients). Driving pressure and elastances of the respiratory system and of the lung were higher when complete airway closure was not taken into account in their calculation. End-expiratory esophageal pressure (ρ = 0.69 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.82]; P < 0.001), but not chest wall elastance, was associated with BMI, whereas elastance of the lung was negatively correlated with BMI (ρ = -0.27 [95% CI, -0.56 to -0.10]; P = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS Prevalence of complete airway closure was high in ARDS and should be taken into account when calculating respiratory mechanics, especially in the most morbidly obese patients. : WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: Plateau and driving pressures have been shown to correlate with mortality in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, these static airway pressures may not always accurately reflect alveolar pressure.It has recently been recognized that in ARDS, airway closure may occur while some alveoli are still inflated. This may result in a biased estimate of mean alveolar pressure.Complete airway closure can only be measured by the inflection point on the initial portion of a low-flow inflation pressure-volume or pressure-time curve with the absence of cardiac oscillations and very low compliance, most likely in the terminal bronchioles.In 25 to 33% of patients with ARDS, airway opening pressure (the inflection point value) is greater than the total positive end-expiratory pressure measured by an end-expiratory maneuver.

There is evidence of the pathogenic role of neurotropic viruses in neurodegenerative diseases and coronaviruses are neurotropic, with some of them selectively targeting the basal ganglia. Moreover, some authors demonstrated the longevity of these viruses in the affected cells of the nervous system for long periods. Coronavirus was detected in brain autopsies and SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from the CSF of affected patients. The marked inflammatory response in some particular patients with COVID-19 with a consequent increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines is considered a prognostic factor. Immunologic changes are observed in patients with Parkinson's disease, possibly having a role in its pathogenesis. A dynamic pro-inflammatory state accompanies α-synuclein accumulation and the development and progression of neurodegeneration. Also, some viral infectious diseases might have a role as triggers, generating a cross autoimmune reaction against α-synuclein. In the past Coronaviruses have been related to Parkinson's disease, however, until now the causal role of these viruses is unknown. In this paper, our focus is to assess the potential relationship between SARS-CoV-2 infection and Parkinson's disease.",2020-09-17,"Chaná-Cuevas, Pedro; Salles-Gándara, Philippe; Rojas-Fernandez, Alejandro; Salinas-Rebolledo, Constanza; Milán-Solé, Anna",Front Neurol,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/0b5a3e0da11f46bf632b05e468f8b51c0b74a792.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7527541.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.01044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33041985/,221742526.0

WHO has recommended a cumulative engagement of minimum 150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity. Maintaining physical activity throughout life is considered an important public health objective. However, there is a global trend towards engaging in sedentary behaviours. There is no previous work on the physical activity pattern in Eastern India, nor any study to find predictors in terms of non-communicable disease causation. Objectives: To find out the prevalence and patterns of physical activity in urban population. To investigate the relationship of non-communicable disease with physical inactivity. Materials and methods: The study was community based cross-sectional survey and systematic random sampling method was used for arriving at a total sample of 1203 subjects from the 30 clusters selected out of 67 wards in the city. Socio-demographic and health profile were collected along with physical activity using IPAQ score, and stage of change for physical activity behaviour using Prochaska and DiClemente's model. IBM SPSS 20.0 was used for analysis. Logistic regression analyses were used to compute adjusted odds ratios for each variable. Causality of chronic disease due to physical inactivity was tested through inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using marginal structural model (MSM). Statistical significance were tested at p=0.05. Results: A total of 1221 subjects were included in the study, and a total 1125 cases were included for analysis after data cleaning. Mean age of the study participants was 35.25 (SD 10.72) years. 71.9% of the respondents were found physically inactive, 15.9% practised 'yogasana'. General caste, presence of chronic disease, being in a static stage of change and a yogassana practitioner were all factors influencing physical activity positively. Physically inactive individuals were also found to have 1.54 times higher odds of having chronic disease than those who are physically active. Conclusion: Prevalence of physical activity among the smart city was found to be low.

As advocates, practitioners, researchers, and as a family member for one of us, we believe it is time to look beyond employment statistics and a historically short-term focus on employment We would like to see a reorientation of our collective energies toward a longer-term view of employment that contributes to a good life for individuals, on their terms What is already known about this topic? Over the last 15 years, many employment advancement programs for autistic adults have shown promising results We have seen positive impacts from evaluations of these programs that include improved skills, more hiring of autistic individuals, shifting employer attitudes, more inclusive work environments, and high levels of productivity among hired autistic adults We also have increased our understanding about the characteristics of supportive work environments for autistic people That said, we also know that there are continuing low levels We recommend five shifts in focus for the future: (1) nurture long-term rather than short-term employment success;(2) seek community-wide programming to support people on an ongoing basis, as opposed to a more narrow focus on individual-level job readiness;(3) provide professional development that starts with an indi-vidual's strengths, and not with their disability;(4) develop more comprehensive and accessible community resources instead of relying on families to offset community service gaps;and (5) uphold the goal of having a good life on one's own terms instead of only getting a job How will these recommendations help autistic adults now or in the future? We hope that these recommendations help spark new conversations and collective approaches toward improving the employment landscape for autistic individuals These approaches would move beyond a short-term job focus and individual-level readiness programming to also build supportive community ecosystems around individuals over time In this way, we hope that individuals can more easily achieve employment over the long term that both works for them and contributes to the important and overarching aim of quality of life",2020,"Nicholas, David B.; Klag, Malvina",Autism in Adulthood,nan,#630119,nan,nan,nan,nan,225685596.0

STUDY DESIGN: We designed a case-control and cross-sectional study using surveys. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Scale questionnaire (STAI-T) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) which were validated in Turkish were given to outpatient women with high-risk pregnancies as study group and normal pregnancies as control group. A total of 446 women were recruited. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between those with and without high-risk pregnancy in terms of Trait-State Anxiety scores with COVID-19 pandemic (p < 0.05). We found an increased prevalence of anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic in high-risk pregnant women comparing to pregnancies with no risk factors (p < 0.05). There was a statistically significant difference between the education level in high-risk pregnant women in terms of anxiety scores (p < 0.05), Beck Anxiety score was highest in high school graduates (42.75). While the level of Trait Anxiety was the highest with pandemic in those with high-risk pregnancy with threatened preterm labor and preterm ruptures of membranes (58.0), those with thrombophilia were the lowest (50.88). The State Anxiety level and Beck Anxiety Score of those with maternal systemic disease were the highest (53.32 and 45.53), while those with thrombophilia were the lowest (46.96 and 40.08). The scores of Trait Anxiety (56.38), State Anxiety (52.14), Beck Anxiety (43.94) were statistically higher during the pandemic in those hospitalized at least once (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: High-risk pregnant women require routine anxiety and depression screening and psychosocial support during the COVID-19 pandemic. High-risk pregnancy patients have comorbid conditions most of the time, hence they not only at more risk for getting infected, but also have higher anxiety scores because of the stress caused by COVID-19 pandemic.",2020,"Sinaci, Selcan; Ozden Tokalioglu, Eda; Ocal, Doga; Atalay, Aysegul; Yilmaz, Gamze; Keskin, Huseyin Levent; Erdinc, Seval Ozgu; Sahin, Dilek; Moraloglu Tekin, Ozlem",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,nan,#928977,nan,nan,nan,nan,225056416.0

In order to enhance cytokine removal capacity by increasing adsorption area, we devised a double polymethyl methacrylate continuous hemodiafiltration method, which involves serial connection of two polymethyl methacrylate membrane hemofilters, and we report clinical efficacy with this method. Of 74 patients who underwent continuous hemodiafiltration and had interleukin-6 blood levels measured during their ICU stay between March 2010 and June 2012, 13 patients with hypercytokinemia (interleukin-6 blood level >900 pg/mL) underwent series double continuous hemodiafiltration to be treated for hypercytokinemia. Cytokine reduction rate and clinical efficacy were compared between those 13 patients and those with a similar pathological condition who underwent continuous hemodiafiltration using the single polymethyl methacrylate membrane hemofilter.

Logistic regression was used to estimate the likelihood of fear of limited access to food and the likelihood of purchase of larger amounts of food than usual. The likelihood of experiencing fear of limited access to food increased by 16% with higher perceived stress, by 50% with higher trust in “Mass media and friends”, and by 219% with perceived changes in food availability in the previous month.

This protocol outlines an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational cohort studies to explore the overall effect of delayed prescribing and identify key patient characteristics that are associated with efficacy of delayed prescribing. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic search of the databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, EBSCO CINAHL Plus and Web of Science was conducted to identify relevant studies from inception to October 2017. Outcomes of interest include duration of illness, severity of illness, complication, reconsultation and patient satisfaction. Study authors of eligible papers will be contacted and invited to contribute raw IPD data. IPD data will be checked against published data, harmonised and aggregated to create one large IPD database. Multilevel regression will be performed to explore interaction effects between treatment allocation and patient characteristics. The economic evaluation will be conducted based on IPD from the combined trial and observational studies to estimate the differences in costs and effectiveness for delayed prescribing compared with normal practice. A decision model will be developed to assess potential savings and cost-effectiveness in terms of reduced antibiotic usage of delayed prescribing and quality-adjusted life years. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Southampton Faculty of Medicine Research Ethics Committee (Reference number: 30068). Findings of this study will be published in peer-reviewed academic journals as well as General Practice trade journals and will be presented at national and international conferences.

METHODS Data from consecutive patients who underwent SPSG in our institution between August 2010 and July 2015 were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Patients with more than 1-year follow-up were included in our analysis for weight loss and co-morbidity. RESULTS A total of 1000 patients underwent SPSG during the study period. Median body mass index was 42.6 kg/m² (range: 33.8-84.6 kg/m²). Median operative time was 112 minutes (range: 50-360 min) and decreased over the years. Completion of the procedure required introduction of an extraport in 78 patients (7.8%). Postoperative mortality and morbidity rates were .1% and 8.1%, respectively.

In our experiments, saliva was sufficiently stable for testing for at least 24 hours after collection. The results obtained from the saliva of a SARS-CoV-2 positive patient were consistent with those obtained from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs from the same patient with the sensitivity 90% and specificity 100% during the first two weeks after the onset of symptoms. To demonstrate the usefulness of testing saliva material for mass screening, crowd sampling with pooling was performed on 3660 people in 3-day time (44 samples were tested positive).

Several studies suggest that cytokine storms (interleukins) may play an important role in severe cases of COVID-19. Neutralizing key inflammatory factors in cytokine release syndrome (CRS) could therefore be of great value in reducing the mortality rate. Tocilizumab (TCZ) in its intravenous (IV) form of administration -RoActemra® 20â¯mg/mL (Roche)- is indicated for treatment of severe CRS patients. Preliminary investigations have concluded that inhibition of IL-6 with TCZ appears to be efficacious and safe, with several ongoing clinical trials. This has led to a huge increase in demand for IV TCZ for treating severe COVID-19 patients in hospitals, which has resulted in shortages. Here, we present a comparability study assessing the main critical physicochemical attributes of TCZ solutions used for infusion, at 6â¯mg/mL and 4â¯mg/mL, prepared from RoActeram® 20â¯mg/mL (IV form) and from RoActemra® 162â¯mg (0.9â¯mL solution pre-filled syringe, subcutaneous form), to evaluate the use of the latter for preparing clinical solutions required for IV administration, so that in a situation of shortage of the IV medicine, the SC form could be used to prepare the solutions for IV delivery of TCZ.

There are no published data pertaining to changes in cerebral oxygenation seen with increases in the inspired oxygen fraction or end-tidal carbon dioxide in patients anesthetized in the beach chair position. Furthermore, the effect anesthetic agents have has not been thoroughly investigated in this context. We plan to test the hypothesis that changes in inspired oxygen fraction or end-tidal carbon dioxide correlate to a significant change in regional cerebral oxygenation in anesthetized patients in beach chair position. We will also compare the effects that inhaled and intravenous anesthetics have on this process. METHODS/DESIGN This is a prospective within-group study of patients undergoing shoulder arthroscopy in the beach chair position which incorporates a randomized comparison between two anesthetics, approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. The primary outcome measure is the change in regional cerebral oxygenation due to sequential changes in oxygenation and ventilation. A sample size of 48 will have greater than 80% power to detect an absolute 4-5% difference in regional cerebral oxygenation caused by changes in ventilation strategy. The secondary outcome is the effect of anesthetic choice on cerebral desaturation in the beach chair position or response to changes in ventilation strategy. Fifty-four patients will be recruited, allowing for drop out, targeting 24 patients in each group randomized to an anesthetic. Regional cerebral oxygenation will be measured using the INVOS 5100C monitor (Covidien, Boulder, CO). Following induction of anesthesia, intubation and positioning, inspired oxygen fraction and minute ventilation will be sequentially adjusted. At each set point, regional cerebral oxygenation will be recorded and venous blood gas analysis performed. The overall statistical analysis will use a repeated measures analysis of variance with Tukey's HSD procedure for post hoc contrasts. DISCUSSION If simple maneuvers of ventilation or anesthetic technique can prevent cerebral hypoxia, patient outcome may be improved. This is the first study to investigate the effects of ventilation strategies on cerebral oxygenation in patients anesthetized in beach chair position.

Our agents are characterised by a microscopic state, which changes due to their mutual interactions, and by a label, which identifies a group to which they belong. Besides interacting within and across the groups, the agents may change label according to a state-dependent Markov-type jump process. Hence the mass of each group is not conserved. We derive general kinetic equations for the joint interaction/label switching processes in each group. Moreover, for prototypical birth/death dynamics we characterise the transient and equilibrium kinetic distributions of the groups via a Fokker-Planck asymptotic analysis.

The economic and sanitary impact has been enormous. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. How to effectively prevent and control SARS-CoV-2 transmission while providing care to surgical patients during the pandemic is a crucial topic. In order to minimize the risk of cross-infection between patients and physicians, many hospitals have taken measures to limit outpatient services, elective hospitalizations, and the number of operations. Based on the prevention and control measures stipulated by major medical institutions in China, this overview provides recommendations for surgeons from three aspects: outpatient treatment, ward management and perioperative protection. Telemedicine should be encouraged as a means of social distancing. Outpatient examination should be selected. Reasonable spatial arrangement and effective environmental disinfection are important for ward management. Patient selection for surgery and timing of operations should be carefully discussed within multi-disciplinary teams. Appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn adapted to the situational risk. On December 31, 2019, China reported to the WHO Country Office a pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan [2,4]. Subsequently, the disease later named COVID-19 affected a substantial proportion of the population in Wuhan and spread to other areas of China. Relying on a nationwide shutdown and mandatory quarantine, China has effectively curtailed the domestic outbreak. However, due to the high transmissibility of SARS-Cov-2 and the mobility of people, COVID-19 spread to the rest of the world. Many hospitals worldwide were faced with confirmed and suspected SARS-Cov-2 infections, putting a huge strain on the safety of patients and employees. Consequently, surgical patients who seek medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic present significant challenges. This paper summarizes medical care and infection prevention and control in general surgery patients during the COVID-19, pandemic in the light of the current situation in China. It provides reference for surgeons and decision makers in health care in other countries suffering from the COVID-19 pandemic.",2020-07-05,"Liu, Fenglin; Wang, Weibin; Yu, Hong; Wang, Yong; Wu, Wenming; Qin, Xinyu; Zhao, Yupei",nan,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/e22aeb8e026cf0d2dab81cb85f42dcab870dd4da.json,nan,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666262020300061?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2666262020300061,220334622.0

Sequencing revealed that wild-type PEDVs ORF3 genes had a single ORF of 675 nucleotides encoding a protein of 224 amino acids with a predicted M (r) of 25.1–25.3 kDa. Attenuated-type PEDVs ORF3 genes had a single ORF of 624 nucleotides encoding a protein of 207 amino acids with a predicted M (r) of 23.4 kDa. The coding region of the ORF3 gene of attenuated-type PEDVs including attenuated DR13, KPED-9, and P-5V had 51 nucleotide deletions that were not found in the ORF3 genes of wild-type PEDVs including CV777, Br1/87, LZC, parent DR13, and 12 field samples. In addition, attenuated-type PEDVs have previously been found to exhibit reduced pathogenicity in pigs. Therefore, 51 nucleotide deletions appear to be meaningful and may be significant for PEDV pathogenicity, because they lead to changes in the predicted amino acid sequences of attenuated-type PEDVs. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on the partial ORF3 gene including 51 nucleotide deletions revealed that all PEDVs fell into two types, wild- and attenuated-type PEDVs. Wild-type PEDVs containing parent DR13 and 12 field samples had RT-PCR products of 245 bp in size, while attenuated-type PEDVs containing PEDV vaccine strains (attenuated DR13, KPED-9, P-5V) had products of 194 bp. In addition, all PEDV vaccine strains were used as live virus vaccine, because they previously exhibited a reduced pathogenicity in pigs. Therefore, large deletion region, which is comprise 17 amino acid deletions caused by 51 nucleotide deletions and is seen in all PED live vaccine strains, may be important site for PEDV pathogenicity, and we can use it for differentiation of wild- and attenuated-type PEDVs.",2007-10-12,"Park, Seong-Jun; Moon, Hyoung-Joon; Luo, Yuzi; Kim, Hye-Kwon; Kim, Eun-Mi; Yang, Jeong-Sun; Song, Dae-Sub; Kang, Bo-Kyu; Lee, Chul-Seung; Park, Bong-Kyun",Virus Genes,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/5dbdae1a2d7e86db80696e2c26571c3f1138dd3e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7088598.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17932736/,10660910.0

The Sibutramine Cardiovascular Outcomes (SCOUT) trial can provide the first evidence of the effect of intentional weight loss on mortality in an obese population at high risk. METHODS SCOUT was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing sibutramine vs. placebo. Eligibility for the trial required both men and women aged at least 55 years, with BMI of at least 27 kg/m and 45 kg/m or less. Study participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) only should have at least one other risk factor defined as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, smoking, or diabetic nephropathy, and/or they had a history of cardiovascular disease. Study participants were stratified in three groups: patients with T2DM, patients with a prior cardiovascular event but without diabetes, and patients with both T2DM and a prior cardiovascular event.The relationship between weight loss and mortality (all-cause, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular) was investigated with Cox regression models. RESULTS The main study showed that all-cause mortality was not different in patients allocated to sibutramine or placebo. This ancillary analysis demonstrates that there is a general trend showing higher mortality in patients with the greatest weight loss (weight reduction >10 kg) and in those with increasing weight (>1 kg). If integrated weight loss (area under the curve from baseline to 12 months) is used, these observations are confirmed. The impact of substantial weight loss on mortality is marked in those dying of noncardiovascular causes, specifically cancer.

In the setting of superset learning, instances are assumed to be labeled with a set of possible annotations, which is assumed to contain the correct one. In this article, we study the application of rough set theory in the setting of superset learning. In particular, we consider the problem of feature reduction as a mean for data disambiguation, i.e., for the purpose of figuring out the most plausible precise instantiation of the imprecise training data.

OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to describe the current landscape of POCT in Wisconsin community pharmacies and identify opportunities for the advancement of testing and the key factors influencing the realization of these opportunities. METHODS: A survey was administered over the telephone to pharmacy managers of community pharmacies in Wisconsin. The sites were randomly selected from predefined geographic regions to mirror pharmacy distribution across Wisconsin. The survey items evaluated provision of POCT, future direction of POCT, barriers and motivators to offering POCT, and pharmacy demographics. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis were used to analyze data. RESULTS: Pharmacy managers from 147 of the 938 registered community pharmacies (15.7%) participated in the survey. Only 17.1% of the pharmacies were offering POCT; however, 48.3% of managers reported that their pharmacy would likely implement or expand POCT within the next 5 years. The most commonly reported barriers to initiating or expanding POCT were the limitations on pharmacist availability to oversee testing and workflow restrictions. Continuing to advance the pharmacy profession was a top reason for offering or expanding testing services. DISCUSSION: While few pharmacies are offering POCT in Wisconsin, there is motivation for expansion in coming years. Understanding, anticipating and addressing common barriers can faciliate this process.

The detailed clinical features and virological data of pediatric patients with COVID-19, particularly young infants, remain unclear. Here, the clinical and virological characteristics of four children with COVID-19 including two young infants were investigated. One- and 4-month-old boys with COVID-19 were both asymptomatic, and seroconversion was demonstrated. These findings suggest that even young infants can mount an immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), despite having weaker immune defenses than adolescents and adults. Three-year-old boy, who was SARS-CoV-2-negative, was admitted to the same room as his SARS-CoV-2-positive father due to the lack of caregivers. Although he was asymptomatic, he had seroconverted to SARS-CoV-2. Eleven-year-old boy, who was sibling of the 3-year-old boy, was also SARS-CoV-2-negative. He was isolated in his own room and did not seroconvert. If young children are SARS-CoV-2 negative, they should be isolated from their SARS-CoV-2-positive parents.

With the introduction of new treatment classes, it is important to examine patient symptoms and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) at the start of this changing therapeutic landscape. This real-world study describes the patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer receiving ET-based regimens who were naïve to systemic treatment in the advanced setting across five European countries (EU5). METHODS: Data were collected between March and July 2017 from surveyed oncologists and their patients at a single time point using the multinational Adelphi Advanced Breast Cancer Disease Specific Programme&#8482;. Patients completed PRO questionnaires on HRQoL (EORTC QLQ-C30), pain severity and interference, and work and activity impairment. A multiple linear regression model explored factors associated with HRQoL. RESULTS: Across EU5, 226 physicians provided data on 781 women with HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer taking their first ET-based regimen for advanced disease, of whom 252 provided PRO data. This subset had a mean age of 67.1 years, 94% were postmenopausal, 89% were diagnosed with advanced breast cancer at initial presentation, 79% had stage IV disease (66% of these patients had bone metastases and 38% had visceral metastases, including 18% with liver metastases) and 77% were on endocrine-only therapy as their initial treatment for advanced disease. The mean EORTC QLQ-C30 global health score (50.9) was worse than the reference value for patients with advanced breast cancer (60.2). Fatigue, pain, and insomnia were the most severe symptoms, and mean functioning scores were also worse than reference values. ""Worst pain"" and ""pain interference"" were moderate/severe for 42 and 80% of patients. Mean activity impairment was 44%, and greater activity impairment was associated with poorer HRQoL.

Our paper does not claim to have found the cure for COVID-19, neither does it claim that the suggested model have taken into account all the complexities around the spread of the disease. Nonetheless, the fundamental question asked in this paper is to know if within the conditions taken into account in this suggested model, the integral lock-down is effective in saving human lives. To answer this question, a mathematical model was suggested taking into account the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 from dead bodies to humans and the effect of lock-down. Three cases were considered. The first case suggested that there is transmission from dead to the living (medical staffs as they perform postmortem procedures on corpses, and direct contacts with during burial ceremonies). This case has no equilibrium points except for disease free equilibrium, a clear indication that care must be taken when dealing with corpses due to corona-19. In the second case we removed the transmission rate from dead bodies. This case showed an equilibrium point, although the number of deaths, carriers and infected grew exponentially up to a certain stability level. In the last case, we incorporated a lock-down and social distancing effect, using the next generation matrix. We could achieve a zero reproduction number, with number of deaths, infected and carriers decaying very rapidly. This is a clear indication that if lock-down recommendations are observed the threat of COVID-19 can be reduced to zero in few months.While our mathematical model agrees with the effectiveness of the lock-down, it is important to mention damaging effects of inadequate testing. The long waiting period of few days before confirmation of status, can only lead to more infections. The asymptomatic tested person could be positive and spread the infection, or could contact the virus in days after testing and will spread the disease further, after being given a false result. Testing kit that with immediate results are needed for more efficient measures. We used Italy's Data to guide the construction of the mathematical model. To include non-locality into mathematical formulas, differential and integral operators were suggested. Properties and numerical approximations were presented in details.

Many pathological situations can impair gas exchange and, therefore, may contribute to progressive lung damage and ILD. Consequently, diagnosis approach needs to be structured with a clinical evaluation requiring a careful history paying attention to exposures and systemic diseases. Several classifications for ILD have been proposed but none is entirely satisfactory especially in children.

METHODS: A multicenter, collaborative, patient-level analysis was conducted. Patients with cardiogenic shock and moderate to severe (3+) or severe (4+) MR who were not surgical candidates were treated with TMVr. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality Secondary outcomes included 90-day mortality, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, and the combined event rate of 90-day mortality and HF hospitalization following dichotomization by TMVr device success. RESULTS: Between January 2011 and February 2019, 141 patients across 14 institutions met the inclusion criteria. In-hospital mortality occurred in 22 patients (15.6%), at 90 days in 38 patients (29.5%), and at one year in 55 patients (42.6%). Median length of hospital stay following TMVr was 10 days (interquartile range: 6 to 20 days). HF hospitalization occurred in 26 patients (18.4%) at a median of 73 days (interquartile range: 26 to 546 days). When stratified by TMVr procedural results, successful TMVr reduced rates of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13 to 0.98; p = 0.04), 90-day mortality (HR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.78; p = 0.01), and the composite of 90-day mortality and HF hospitalization (HR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.90; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: TMVr may improve short- and intermediate-term mortality in high-risk patients with cardiogenic shock and moderate to severe MR. Randomized studies are needed to definitively establish MR as a therapeutic target in patients with cardiogenic shock.",2020,"Jung, Richard G; Simard, Trevor; Kovach, Christopher; Flint, Kelsey; Don, Creighton; Di Santo, Pietro; Adamo, Marianna; Branca, Luca; Valentini, Francesca; Benito-González, Tomás; Fernández-Vázquez, Felipe; Estévez-Loureiro, Rodrigo; Berardini, Alessandra; Conti, Nicolina; Rapezzi, Claudio; Biagini, Elena; Parlow, Simon; Shorr, Risa; Levi, Amos; Manovel, Ana; Cardenal-Piris, Rosa; Diaz Fernandez, Jose; Shuvy, Mony; Haberman, Dan; Sala, Alessandra; Alkhouli, Mohamad A; Marini, Claudia; Bargagna, Marta; Schiavi, Davide; Denti, Paolo; Markovic, Sinisa; Buzzatti, Nicola; Chan, Vincent; Hynes, Mark; Mesana, Thierry; Labinaz, Marino; Pappalardo, Federico; Taramasso, Maurizio; Hibbert, Benjamin",JACC cardiovasc. interv,nan,#33069653,nan,nan,nan,nan,224783670.0

In the context of lessons learned, moving forward some of what was previously routine could remain reserved for more exceptional circumstances. In order to determine what is “routine”, what is “essential”, and what is “exceptional” it is necessary to view medical decisions within the paradigm of high-quality care.

The present review focuses on some recent developments and promising clinical progresses in wound management. RECENT FINDINGS New findings have increased our knowledge in several wound areas. In the treatment of wounds, the new trend in the wound device marked is to produce dressings containing compounds or drugs. This could be local antiseptics (silver, other antiseptics, honey) and pain relieving drugs such as ibuprofen and morphine. New treatments such as anti-tumor necrosis factor alfa (anti-TNFalpha) and Lactobacillus plantarum cultures have also been successfully used in hard to heal, atypical wounds. Knowledge on influencing factors as smoking and biofilm on the healing process has also been improved. Smoking results in delayed healing and increased risk of postoperative infection, whereas the role of biofilm is still at an exploratory level. Organizing models for optimal wound management are constantly being developed and refined. SUMMARY Recent knowledge on the importance of new dressing materials containing active substances, new treatments for atypical wounds, influencing factors on the healing process and organization in the wound area are increasingly been launched.

Spinal cord demyelination is also induced following intranasal inoculation with neurotropic MHV strains, however much higher viral doses are required as compared to intracranial inoculation. Recently, it was shown that intranasal administration of low concentrations of proteins leads to significant, rapid accumulation of protein in the optic nerve and in the eye, with only low levels reaching spinal cord and other brain regions. Thus, we examined whether intranasal inoculation with MHV at doses equivalent to those given intracranially could induce optic neuritis—inflammation, demyelination and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the optic nerve with or without inducing spinal cord demyelination. Four week old male C57BL/6J mice were inoculated intracranially with the recombinant demyelinating strain RSA59, or intranasally with RSA59 or the non-demyelinating strain RSMHV2 as control. One month post-inoculation, mice inoculated intracranially with RSA59 had significant myelin loss in both spinal cord and optic nerves, with significant loss of RGCs as well, consistent with prior studies. As expected, intranasal inoculation with RSA59 failed to induce demyelination in spinal cord; however, it also did not induce optic nerve demyelination. No acute inflammation was found, and no viral antigen was detected, in the optic nerve or retina 1 day after inoculation. Results confirm the neurotropic effects of RSA59 following intracranial inoculation, and suggest that direct infection with axonal transport of virus from brain to spinal cord and optic nerve is required to induce demyelinating disease. These studies suggest that MHV does not selectively concentrate in optic nerve and retina to sufficient levels to induce demyelination following intranasal inoculation. Intracranial inoculation should continue to be considered a preferred method for studies of MHV-induced optic neuritis and central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disease.",2018-09-04,"Singh, Manmeet; Khan, Reas S.; Dine, Kimberly; Das Sarma, Jayasri; Shindler, Kenneth S.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/eb65ef8d3ff24ddb51c4f091a46394f513a9d4d9.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6132074.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6132074/,nan

There may be instances however, where the pressures generated by the roller pump may not be compatible with the warming device. We assessed a commonly used roller pump in combination with a HOTLINE® Fluid Warmer, and found that it could generate pressures exceeding the HOTLINE® manufacturers specifications. This was of concern because the HOTLINE® manufacturer guideline states that not for use with pressure devices generating over 300 mmHg. Pressure greater than 300 mmHg may compromise the integrity of the HOTLINE® Fluid Warming Set. The aim of this study was to compare in-line pressure within a HOTLINE® Fluid Warmer at different infusion rates of a roller pump using various sizes of intravenous cannulae. The rapid infusion system comprised a 500 mL-normal saline bag, roller pump type infusion device, HOTLINE® Fluid Warmer (blood and fluid warmer system), and six different sizes of intravenous cannulae. In-line pressure was measured proximal to the HOTLINE® (pre-warmer) and proximal to the cannula (post-warmer), at flow rate of 50-160 mL/min. The in-line pressures increased significantly with increasing flow rate. The pre-warmer pressures exceeded 300 mmHg when the flow rate was ≥120 mL/min with 20-gauge, 48 mm length cannula, 130 with 20-gauge, 25 mm cannula, and 160 mL/min with 18-gauge, 48 mm cannula. However, they were <300 mmHg at any flow rates with 18-gauge, 30 mm cannula and 16-gauge cannulae. The post-warmer pressures exceeded 300 mmHg at the flow rate of 140 mL/min with 20-gauge, 48 mm cannula, and 160 mL/min with 20-gauge, 25 mm cannula, while they were <300 mmHg at any flow rates with 18 and 16-gauge cannulae. The in-line pressure within a HOTLINE® could exceed 300 mmHg, depending on the flow rate and size and length of cannula.

Therefore, treatment with immunomodulating agents should be initiated as soon as hyperinflammation is established. Evidence for the use of tocilizumab (TCZ) in COVID-19 is emerging, but the drug in this setting is used ""off label"" with limited data on both effectiveness and safety. Therefore, Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Warsaw established a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for the use of TCZ in severe COVID-19 cases. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we present a case of 27-year-old, otherwise healthy man, who was successfully treated with chloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab and a standard of care. Initially the magnitude of lung devastation, clinical deterioration and the need for mechanical ventilation suggested unfavorable prognosis. However, we observed complete regression in radiological changes and rapid clinical improvement. Irrespective of this, patient's serum interleukin 6 and aminotransferases remained elevated even after a month from treatment. CONCLUSIONS: An overlapping effect of hyperinflammation, hypoxic organ injury and drug-related toxicity warrants a long-term follow-up for COVID-19 survivors. In addition, residual IL-6 receptors blockage may mask new infections. A standardized approach to follow-up for COVID-19 survivors is urgently needed.

The present research aims at investigating the therapeutic potential of Chloroquine and its potent derivative Hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. At the same time screening was performed for some chemically synthesized derivatives of Chloroquine and compared their binding efficacy with chemically synthesized Chloroquine derivatives through in silico approaches. For the purpose of the study, some essential viral proteins and enzymes were selected that are implicated in SARS-CoV-2 replication and multiplication as putative drug targets. Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, and some of their chemically synthesized derivatives, taken from earlier published studies were selected as drug molecules. We have conducted molecular docking and related studies between Chloroquine and its derivatives and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, and the findings show that both Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine can bind to specific structural and non-structural proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection with different efficiencies. Our current study also shows that some of the chemically synthesized Chloroquine derivatives can also potentially inhibit various SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins by binding to them and concomitantly effectively disrupting the active site of these proteins. These findings bring into light another possible mechanism of action of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine and also pave the way for further drug repurposing and remodeling.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

We performed a microparticle-based immunoassay for the detection of IgG against nucleoprotein (NP) and spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD), and a microneutralization assay for the detection of neutralizing antibodies. RESULTS: Three Chinese children with typical KD were identified. They had no epidemiological links with COVID-19 patients and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 NPA PCR. They were treated with IVIG and aspirin, and were discharged without complications. Subsequently 2 of them were tested positive against anti-RBD and anti-NP antibodies and 1 was tested positive against anti- RBD antibodies.

The SFTSV glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, facilitate viral entry into host cells. Gn and Gc are generated from a precursor protein, Gn/Gc, but it is currently unknown how the precursor is converted into the single proteins and whether this process is required for viral infectivity. Employing a rhabdoviral pseudotyping system, we demonstrate that a predicted signal sequence at the N-terminus of Gc is required for Gn/Gc processing and viral infectivity while potential proprotein convertase cleavage sites in Gc are dispensable. Moreover, we show that expression of Gn or Gc alone is not sufficient for host cell entry while particles bearing both proteins are infectious, and we provide evidence that Gn facilitates Golgi transport and virion incorporation of Gc. Collectively, these results suggest that signal peptidase liberates mature Gc from the Gn/Gc precursor and that this process is essential for viral infectivity and thus constitutes a potential target for antiviral intervention.",2016-11-17,"Plegge, Teresa; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Spiegel, Martin; Pöhlmann, Stefan",PLoS One,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/cc65afbab3c952058f9261b012cdc4407a9d264c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5113920.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0166013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27855227/,16321843.0

In this population, influenza virus can replicate for prolonged periods, despite neuraminidase inhibitor treatment, leading to resistance and treatment failure. Baloxavir targets the influenza polymerase and may be an effective treatment option in these patients. METHODS: We used baloxavir to treat five allogeneic SCT recipients that were still symptomatic and shedding influenza virus after completing one or more treatment courses of oseltamivir and characterized the viral isolates before and during treatment. RESULTS: Two patients were infected with influenza A/H1pdm09 carrying a neuraminidase variant (H275Y) linked to oseltamivir resistance. Both these two patients were successfully treated with baloxavir. Of the three patients infected with wild-type influenza virus, two cleared the virus after baloxavir treatment, while the third patient developed the polymerase I38T variant linked to baloxavir resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that baloxavir treatment can be effective in treating neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant influenza in profoundly immunocompromised patients.

COVID-19 is a medium-sized, coated virus with a single-stranded RNA. This virus has one of the largest RNA genomes and is approximately 120 nm. The X-Ray and computed tomography (CT) imaging modalities are widely used to obtain a fast and accurate medical diagnosis. Identifying COVID-19 from these medical images is extremely challenging as it is time-consuming, demanding, and prone to human errors. Hence, artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies can be used to obtain consistent high performance. Among the AI methodologies, deep learning (DL) networks have gained much popularity compared to traditional machine learning (ML) methods. Unlike ML techniques, all stages of feature extraction, feature selection, and classification are accomplished automatically in DL models. In this paper, a complete survey of studies on the application of DL techniques for COVID-19 diagnostic and automated segmentation of lungs is discussed, concentrating on works that used X-Ray and CT images. Additionally, a review of papers on the forecasting of coronavirus prevalence in different parts of the world with DL techniques is presented.

We identified and assessed 78 patients who underwent 2- and 3-dimensional echocardiography-guided mini-invasive per-atrial closure of pmVSD in the cardiac surgery department of our institution, from February 2016 to August 2018, and 76 patients who underwent transcatheter closure of VSD guided by fluoroscopy at the pediatric department (percutaneous control group). All the patients underwent echocardiography. Their clinical data were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. All patients were followed up using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) for a maximum of 24 months after the closure. All patients underwent successful device implantation. Echocardiography showed that the major immediate complications included residual shunt, pericardial effusion, and tricuspid regurgitation in the per-atrial group. During the mid-term follow-up period, TTE revealed that the most common complication was tricuspid regurgitation (non-preexisting). There were no cases of VSD recurrence, device displacement, valvular injury, malignant arrhythmias, hemolysis, or death. Moreover, according to the TTE data, the intracardiac structure of the patients were improved. Compared to the control group, the intracardiac manipulation time was shorter and the number of patients with residual shunts, redeployment of devices, or immediate new tricuspid regurgitations was fewer when using 2- and 3-dimensional echocardiography. However, the procedure time in the per-atrial group was slightly longer than that in the control group. Two- and 3-dimensional echocardiography are feasible monitoring tools during mini-invasive per-atrial VSD closure.

The derived packaging signal may be used to design antisense RNA and RNA interfere (RNAi) drugs treating SARS. METHODS Based on the studies about the genomic packaging signals of MHV and BCoV, especially the information about primary and secondary structures, the putative genomic packaging signal of SARS-CoV were analyzed by using bioinformatic tools. Multi-alignment for the genomic sequences was performed among SARS-CoV, MHV, BCoV, PEDV and HCoV 229E. Secondary structures of RNA sequences were also predicted for the identification of the possible genomic packaging signals. Meanwhile, the N and M proteins of all five viruses were analyzed to study the evolutionary relationship with genomic packaging signals. RESULTS The putative genomic packaging signal of SARS-CoV locates at the 3' end of ORF1b near that of MHV and BCoV, where is the most variable region of this gene. The RNA secondary structure of SARS-CoV genomic packaging signal is very similar to that of MHV and BCoV. The same result was also obtained in studying the genomic packaging signals of PEDV and HCoV 229E. Further more, the genomic sequence multi-alignment indicated that the locations of packaging signals of SARS-CoV, PEDV, and HCoV overlaped each other. It seems that the mutation rate of packaging signal sequences is much higher than the N protein, while only subtle variations for the M protein. CONCLUSIONS The probable genomic packaging signal of SARS-CoV is analogous to that of MHV and BCoV, with the corresponding secondary RNA structure locating at the similar region of ORF1b. The positions where genomic packaging signals exist have suffered rounds of mutations, which may influence the primary structures of the N and M proteins consequently.",2003,"Qin, Lei; Xiong, Bin; Luo, Cheng; Guo, Zong-Ming; Hao, Pei; Su, Jiong; Nan, Peng; Feng, Ying; Shi, Yi-Xiang; Yu, Xiao-Jing; Luo, Xiao-Min; Chen, Kai-Xian; Shen, Xu; Shen, Jian-Hua; Zou, Jian-Ping; Zhao, Guo-Ping; Shi, Tie-Liu; He, Wei-Zhong; Zhong, Yang; Jiang, Hua-Liang; Li, Yi-Xue",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12791173/,36512220.0

Fecal and nasal swab samples from 85 Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center (OARDC) feedlot cattle averaging 7 months of age were collected at arrival (0) and at 4, 7, 14, and 21 days postarrival (DPA). An antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect concurrent shedding of BCV in fecal and nasal samples. All samples ELISA positive for BCV were matched with an equal number of BCV ELISA-negative samples and analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the N gene. Paired sera were collected at arrival and 21 DPA and tested for antibodies to BCV using an indirect ELISA. Information on clinical signs, treatments provided, and cattle weights were collected. The overall rates of BCV nasal and fecal shedding were 48% (41/85) and 53% (45/85) by ELISA and 84% (71/85) and 96% (82/85) by RT-PCR, respectively. The peak of BCV nasal and fecal shedding occurred at 4 DPA. Thirty-two cattle (38%) showed concurrent enteric and nasal shedding detected by both tests. Eleven percent of cattle had antibody titers against BCV at 0 DPA and 91% of cattle seroconverted to BCV by 21 DPA. The BCV fecal and nasal shedding detected by ELISA and RT-PCR were statistically correlated with ELISA antibody seroconversion (P < 0.0001); however, BCV fecal and nasal shedding were not significantly related to clinical signs. Seroconversion to BCV was inversely related to average daily weight gains (P < 0.06). Twenty-eight respiratory and 7 enteric BCV strains were isolated from nasal and fetal samples of 32 cattle in HRT-18 cell cultures.

Differences in contour finding suggest algorithm-specific influence on quantification if heart axes are chosen incorrectly. Thus, this study quantified the influence of heart-axis tilt on SSS calculation using Quantitative Perfusion SPECT and 4D-MSPECT. PATIENTS AND METHODS Stress MPS of 50 men acquired on a triple-head gamma camera were correctly reoriented by experienced technologists (R0) and then tilted by 5 degrees/10 degrees/15 degrees/20 degrees/30 degrees/45 degrees along both long axes (R5-R45). SPECT images were quantified for SSS using QPS and 4D-MSPECT. SSS values for R0 and R5-R45 were analyzed using correlation analysis. Weighted kappa values (κ) were calculated to measure agreement regarding perfusion abnormality severity (4-step SSS rating: 0-3, 4-8, 9-13, and ≥14). RESULTS For QPS SSS correlation, R0 vs. tilted datasets remained very high (R > 0.97) up to 20 degrees, but degraded for higher tilts (R = 0.895/0.780 for 30 degrees/45 degrees). 4D-MSPECT showed comparable SSS correlation only up to 10 degrees (R > 0.95) and strong deterioration thereafter (R = 0.863-0.347 for 15-45 degrees). Deviation in severity class from R0 increased from 6/50 (R5; κ = 0.914) to 25/50 (R45; κ = 0.252) using QPS and from 7/50 (R5; κ = 0.899) to 33/50 (R45; κ = 0.065) using 4D-MSPECT. CONCLUSION For tilted MPS datasets, considerable differences in SSS calculation emerge using QPS and 4D-MSPECT.

The PK of ERV in subjects with end stage renal disease (ESRD) or hepatic impairment (HI) were investigated. METHODS: Two multi-center studies were completed; one in subjects with ESRD and one in subjects with mild, moderate or severe HI based upon Child-Pugh scoring. Each included a cohort of healthy subjects (HS) matched by gender, age and BMI. A single IV dose of 1.5 mg/kg ERV was administered. PK parameters were calculated using standard non-compartmental methods and within study comparisons of PK for the ESRD and HI subjects were made with HS. RESULTS: The following comparative AUC(inf) and C(max) values for ERV were observed: CONCLUSION: Following a single IV dose of ERV, the systemic exposures in subjects with ESRD and mild or moderate hepatic impairment were similar to those observed in HS. The 2-fold increase in AUC(inf) observed in subjects with severe HI did not result in increased adverse events. Therefore, no dose adjustment should be required when ERV is given to subjects with either renal or hepatic impairment.

However, RNA purification is expensive, time consuming, and requires technical expertise to perform. Additionally, there have been reported shortages of the RNA purification kits needed for most tests. With these challenges in mind, we report on extraction-free amplification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA directly from patient samples. In addition, we have developed a multiplex RT-PCR using the CDC singleplex targets. This multiplex has a limit of detection of 2 copies/L.

Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures.

NAFLD encompasses a spectrum of liver lesions, including simple steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Although steatosis is often harmless, the lobular inflammation that characterizes nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is considered a driving force in the progression of NAFLD. The current view is that innate immune mechanisms represent a key element in supporting hepatic inflammation in NASH. However, increasing evidence points to the role of adaptive immunity as an additional factor promoting liver inflammation. This Review discusses data regarding the role of B cells and T cells in sustaining the progression of NASH to fibrosis and HCC, along with the findings that antigens originating from oxidative stress act as a trigger for immune responses.

The cell proliferation was examined by CCK-8 and colony formation assays. The migration and invasion abilities were evaluated by wound healing and transwell assays, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis and Luciferase activity assay were applied to determine the interaction between genes. RESULTS The expression of circUBAP2 was upregulated in CRC tissues and cell lines, and depletion of circUBAP2 suppressed the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC. Furthermore, miR-199a inhibitor abrogated the suppressive effect of circUBAP2 knockdown on CRC progression. Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) was identified as a downstream target gene of miR-199a, and overexpression of VEGFA rescued the tumor phenotypes attenuated by circUBAP2 knockdown or miR-199a overexpression.

Simple (and naive) methods of estimating the reproduction number,nan,nan,nan,arxiv,"This is a pedagogical paper on estimating the number of people that can be infected by one infectious person during an epidemic outbreak, known as the reproduction number. Knowing the number is crucial for developing policy responses. There are generally two types of such a number, i.e., basic and effective (or instantaneous). While basic reproduction number is the average expected number of cases directly generated by one case in a population where all individuals are susceptible, effective reproduction number is the number of cases generated in the current state of a population. In this paper, we exploit the deterministic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to estimate them through three different numerical approximations. We apply the methods to the pandemic COVID-19 in Italy to provide insights into the spread of the disease in the country.

METHODS: We have retrospectively searched our electronic database and identified 33 pwMS who had a delay in treatment due to COVID-19 pandemics. The following data were extracted: age, sex, multiple sclerosis (MS) phenotype: relapsing-remitting (RRMS) or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), disease duration, Expanded Disability Status scale (EDSS), previous disease modifying therapy (DMT), number of ocrelizumab cycles prior to the lockdown, dates of first ocrelizumab infusion, last ocrelizumab infusion prior to the lockdown and delayed ocrelizumab infusion after the lockdown. Flow cytometry results, relapses and EDSS progression prior to the delayed ocrelizumab infusion after the lockdown were extracted. RESULTS: The mean time between two ocrelizumab infusion during the lockdown was 7.72±0.64 (range 6.07 to 8.92) months. The mean time between last ocrelizumab infusion and the lymphocyte sampling prior to post COVID infusion was 6.59±0.95 (range 5.18 to 8.49) months. In this period, none of the studied patients had a relapse. In a multivariable linear regression analysis, time from last ocrelizumab infusion to lymphocyte sampling prior to the next infusion was the only significant predictor for CD19+ B cells count, when corrected for the number of previous ocrelizumab cycles and MS phenotype (RRMS or PPMS) (B=7.981, 95% C.I. 3.277-12.686, p=0.002).

But in a pandemic, where the primary responsibility of risk management is not centralised within institutional actors but defused across society, trust can become a double-edged sword. Under these conditions, public trust based on a perception of government competence, care and openness may in fact lead people to underestimate risks and thus reduce their belief in the need to take individual action to control the risks. In this paper, we examine the interaction between trust in government, risk perceptions and public compliance in Singapore in the period between January and April 2020. Using social media tracking and online focus group discussions, we present a preliminary assessment of public responses to government risk communication and risk management measures. We highlight the unique deployment of risk communication in Singapore based on the narrative of ‘defensive pessimism’ to heighten rather than lower levels perceived risk. But the persistence of low public risk perceptions and concomitant low levels of compliance with government risk management measures bring to light the paradox of trust. This calls for further reflection on another dimension of trust which focuses on the role of the public; and further investigation into other social and cultural factors that may have stronger influence over individual belief in the need to take personal actions to control the risks.",2020,"Wong, Catherine Mei Ling; Jensen, Olivia",J.

All mutants were more stable than wild-type ChABC with increased aggregation temperatures between 4° and 8°C. Only ChABC with 37 mutations (ChABC-37) was more active and had a 6.5 times greater half-life than wild-type ChABC, increasing to 106 hours (4.4 days) from only 16.8 hours. ChABC-37, expressed as a fusion protein with Src homology 3 (ChABC-37-SH3), was active for 7 days when released from a hydrogel modified with SH3-binding peptides. This study demonstrates the broad opportunity to improve biocatalysts through computational engineering and sets the stage for future testing of this substantially improved protein in the treatment of debilitating CNS injuries.",2020,"Hettiaratchi, Marian H; O039,; Meara, Matthew J; Meara, Teresa R; Pickering, Andrew J; Letko-Khait, Nitzan; Shoichet, Molly S",Sci.

BCG vaccination trials for reducing SARS-CoV-2 infection are underway, but concerns have been raised regarding the potential harm of strong innate immune responses. To investigate the safety of BCG vaccination, we retrospectively assessed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related symptoms in three cohorts of healthy volunteers who either received BCG in the last 5 years or did not. BCG vaccination is not associated with increased incidence of symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak in the Netherlands. Our data suggest that BCG vaccination might be associated with a decrease in the incidence of sickness during the COVID-19 pandemic (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.58, p < 0.05), and lower incidence of extreme fatigue.

There were numerous intramyelinic vacuoles in the brains of TP-affected birds. Many of these vacuoles contained particulate material compatible with precipitated protein from edema. Astrocyte processes often were distended with similar particulate material. Most intrameylinic vacuoles were either adjacent to the axolemma or within inner myelin lamellae. Myelin sheaths of affected axons, while being displaced, were relatively normal with no vesiculation. Most affected axons were also otherwise normal. Cell processes adjacent to occasional affected axons were distended by degenerating mitochondria, vacuoles, and amorphous material. Some of these processes appeared to be inner loops of oligodendrocyte cytoplasm. The cell bodies of most oligodendrocytes were normal, but a few contained vacuoles similar to those seen in processes adjacent to axons. There were scattered necrotic cells. While most of these could not be specifically identified, some appeared to be oligodendrocytes. Mononuclear inflammatory cells were present both perivascularly and within the parenchyma. Although these cells occasionally contacted myelinated axons and there was myelin phagocytosis, there was no indication that they initiated demyelination. Brain tissue from virus-inoculated resistant birds had perivascular aggregates of mononuclear cells, but there were no intramyelinic vacuoles and few necrotic cells. These findings suggest that intramyelinic vacuolation contributes to the pathogenesis of transient paralysis.

Surgeons gained expertise with the laparoscopic technique and utilized multiple variations that are now utilized in transplant centers throughout the world. Recent modifications include laparoendoscopic single-site and robotic approaches that have been adopted by an additional smaller set of programs. PURPOSE Review was performed of the following eight different surgical approaches to a ""minimally invasive"" live donor nephrectomy: laparoscopic (LDN), hand-assisted laparoscopic (HALDN), retroperitoneoscopic (RLDN), hand-assisted retroperitoneoscopic (HARS), single-port laparoscopic (LESS), robotic-assisted laparoscopic (RALDN), mini open, and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic (NOTES). The techniques are described and summaries of available outcomes and complications are presented. CONCLUSIONS Traditional surgical techniques of open donor nephrectomy have transitioned to minimally invasive techniques.

We used Google Trends (GT) to investigate whether there was a surge in individuals searching for information related to smell loss during the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, France, Iran, and The Netherlands. METHODS: GT was used to explore internet activity related to loss of smell in the 8 aforementioned countries. Spearman rank analysis was performed to correlate loss-of-smell-relative search volumes (RSVs), with the increases of daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 and deaths attributed to disease. As a control event, we also performed analysis of smell-related searches during the last UK influenza epidemic of 2009. RESULTS: In all 8 countries, we observed strong correlations between daily RSVs related to loss of smell, increases of daily COVID-19+ cases and deaths ranging from 0.633 to 0.952. All correlations were statistically significant (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is a strong correlation between the frequency of searches for smell-related information and the onset of COVID-19 infection in Italy, Spain, UK, USA, Germany, France, Iran, and The Netherlands.

52u3wa25,nan,WHO,Platelet-Rich Plasma for Vocal Fold Scar: A Preliminary Report of Concept,nan,nan,nan,unk,"INTRODUCTION: Vocal fold atrophy and scar can lead to loss of normal superficial lamina propria, negatively affecting the vibratory function of the vocal fold. These changes can lead to dysphonia, vocal fatigue, decreased volume, and altered pitch. Treatment options for these conditions are limited. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) consists of platelets, growth factors, and cytokines derived from the patient's own blood and is believed to activate tissue regeneration. The purpose of this study was to review the technical aspects of collecting PRP and injecting it into the vocal fold injection - based on our initial experience with this procedure. CASE: A patient with vocal fold scar was identified and enrolled in an ongoing prospective clinical trial study of a series of 4 monthly subepithelial vocal fold PRP injections, which was temporarily halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patient underwent a single injection of autologous PRP into the left vocal fold. There were no adverse events during the study period. Subjective improvement in voice was noted at 1 month after injection with subsequent return to baseline over the next 4 months. Videostroboscopy performed on postinjection day 1 and day 7 and demonstrated no concerning exam changes. Compared to the preinjection baseline, the patient-reported voice-handicap index-10 (VHI-10) and voice catastrophization index were similar at 4 months following injection (20 to 20 and 4 to 3, respectively). Independent perceptual analysis of voice showed improvement at 4 months postinjection, compared to baseline consensus auditory-perceptual evaluation of voice 60 to 44. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary report was part of a prospective trial investigating the use of PRP to treat vocal fold atrophy and scar. This work highlights the technical considerations for injecting PRP into the vocal fold. Planned prospective enrollment in this study will help to validate the safety and efficacy of PRP injections.",2021,"Bhatt, Neel K; Gao, William Z; Timmons Sund, Lauren; Castro, M Eugenia; O039,; Dell, Karla; Johns, Michael M",J. voice,nan,#1033008,nan,nan,nan,nan,231612536.0

However, the impact of HIV on outcomes in trauma with modern antiretroviral treatment remains unclear. We hypothesized mortality and rates of infectious and inflammatory complications would be higher in HIV positive (HIV+) trauma patients. METHODS: The Trauma Quality Improvement Program was queried to identify trauma patients ≥ 18 years of age with HIV. Due to the imbalance between HIV+ and HIV negative (HIV−) trauma patients, a 1:2 propensity-matched model was utilized. Matched variables included age, injury severity score, mechanism of injury, systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and patient comorbidities. RESULTS: 84 HIV+ patients were matched to 168 HIV− patients. Compared to HIV− patients, HIV+ patients had no significant differences in mortality rate (9.5% vs. 4.8%, p = 0.144) or infectious complications, including pneumonia (6.0% vs. 4.2%, p = 0.530), urinary tract infection (1.2% vs. 1.2%, p = 1.000), or severe sepsis (1.2% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.156). However, higher rates of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (9.5% vs. 0.6%, p < 0.001) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (4.8% vs. 0.0%, p = 0.004) were observed. CONCLUSION: HIV+ trauma patients are not at higher risk of mortality or infectious complications, likely due to the advent and prevalence of combination antiretroviral therapy. However, HIV positivity appears to increase the risk of AKI and ARDS in trauma patients.

AIMS The aim of this study was to gain an understanding of psychosocial responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including depression, anxiety and distress, as well as effective coping styles in an Australian sample. METHOD A sample of 1,495 adults, residing in Australia between April 3rd and May 3rd 2020, completed an online survey which measured psychological distress (Impact of Events Scale-Revised), depression, anxiety, stress (DASS-21), as well as coping strategies (Brief COPE). RESULTS 47% of the respondents were experiencing some degree of psychological distress. Females experienced higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress than males. Coping strategies associated with better mental health were positive reframing, acceptance and humour.

i5ps2pg0,nan,WHO,Inhibition of the INa/K and the activation of peak INa contribute to the arrhythmogenic effects of aconitine and mesaconitine in guinea pigs,nan,nan,nan,unk,"Aconitine (ACO), a main active ingredient of Aconitum, is well-known for its cardiotoxicity. However, the mechanisms of toxic action of ACO remain unclear. In the current study, we investigated the cardiac effects of ACO and mesaconitine (MACO), a structurally related analog of ACO identified in Aconitum with undocumented cardiotoxicity in guinea pigs. We showed that intravenous administration of ACO or MACO (25 µg/kg) to guinea pigs caused various types of arrhythmias in electrocardiogram (ECG) recording, including ventricular premature beats (VPB), atrioventricular blockade (AVB), ventricular tachycardia (VT), and ventricular fibrillation (VF). MACO displayed more potent arrhythmogenic effect than ACO. We conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recording in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes, and observed that treatment with ACO (0.3, 3 µM) or MACO (0.1, 0.3 µM) depolarized the resting membrane potential (RMP) and reduced the action potential amplitude (APA) and durations (APDs) in a concentration-dependent manner. The ACO- and MACO-induced AP remodeling was largely abolished by an INa blocker tetrodotoxin (2 µM) and partly abolished by a specific Na+/K+ pump (NKP) blocker ouabain (0.1 µM). Furthermore, we observed that treatment with ACO or MACO attenuated NKP current (INa/K) and increased peak INa by accelerating the sodium channel activation with the EC50 of 8.36 ± 1.89 and 1.33 ± 0.16 µM, respectively.

We evaluate the accuracy of various models from recent pandemics (SARS, MERS and the 2009 H1N1 outbreak) as a guide to whether we can trust the early model predictions for COVID-19. We show that early models can have good predictive power for a disease's first wave, but they are less predictive of the possibility of a second wave or its strength. The models with the highest accuracy tended to include stochasticity, and models developed for a particular geographic region are often applicable in other regions.

The loop-tree duality is a novel method aimed at overcoming this bottleneck by opening the loop amplitudes into trees and combining them at integrand level with the real-emission matrix elements. In this Letter, we generalize the loop-tree duality to all orders in the perturbative expansion by using the complex Lorentz-covariant prescription of the original one-loop formulation. We introduce a series of mutiloop topologies with arbitrary internal configurations and derive very compact and factorizable expressions of their open-to-trees representation in the loop-tree duality formalism. Furthermore, these expressions are entirely independent at integrand level of the initial assignments of momentum flows in the Feynman representation and remarkably free of noncausal singularities.

In addition, this approach has also helped in establishing the associations of viromes with many diseases. However, unlike the metagenomic studies using 16S rRNA for the detection of bacteria, it is impossible to create universal oligonucleotides to target all known and novel viruses, owing to their genomic diversity and variability. On the other hand, sequencing the entire genome is still expensive and has relatively low sensitivity for such applications. The existing approaches for the design of oligonucleotides for targeted enrichment are usually involved in the development of primers for the PCR-based detection of particular viral species or genera, but not for families or higher taxonomic orders. In this study, we have developed a computational pipeline for designing the oligonucleotides capable of covering a significant number of known viruses within various taxonomic orders, as well as their novel variants. We have subsequently designed a genus-specific oligonucleotide panel for targeted enrichment of viral nucleic acids in biological material and demonstrated the possibility of its application for virus detection in bird samples. We have tested our panel using a number of collected samples and have observed superior efficiency in the detection and identification of viral pathogens.

The objective is to present our experience of tocilizumab use in patients with severe COVID-19. Methods: Observational retrospective cohort study. Hospitalized patients were evaluated by our multidisciplinary team for eventual use of tocilizumab. Patients with progressive ventilatory impairment and evidence of a hyperinflammatory state despite usual treatment received tocilizumab 8 mg/kg intravenous (maximum dose 800 mg), in addition to standard treatment. The use and time of use of mechanical ventilation (MV), the change of the Alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient, of the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) and of inflammation laboratory parameters after 72 h of tocilizumab use was evaluated. Results: 29 patients received tocilizumab. 93.1% were men, 37.9% were obese, and 34.5% had hypertension. Of the 20 patients who were not on MV when receiving tocilizumab, 11 required non-invasive MV, for an average of 5 days, and one of them required intubation. A-a gradient, PaO2/FiO2, and inflammation parameters improved significantly. A better lymphocyte count, which improved significantly after tocilizumab use, was significantly associated with less use of MV.

We included empirical studies with quantitative estimates of the effect of school closures/reopenings on SARS-CoV-2 community transmission. We excluded prospective modelling studies and intra-school transmission studies. We performed a narrative synthesis due to data heterogeneity. Results We identified 3,318 articles, of which ten were included, with data from 146 countries. All studies assessed school closures, and one additionally examined re-openings. There was substantial heterogeneity between studies. Three studies, including the two at lowest risk of bias, reported no impact of school closures on SARS-CoV-2 transmission; whilst the other seven reported protective effects. Effect sizes ranged from no association to substantial and important reductions in community transmission. Discussion Studies were at risk of confounding and collinearity from other non-pharmacological interventions implemented close to school closures.

Our goal is to demonstrate that revitalized paradigms of the past can still be useful with modest reconceptualization, while at the same time new intellectual movements in the other social sciences, especially economics and psychology, incorporating evolutionary ideas from biology provide sociology with an opportunity to develop its own approach to evolutionary analysis that avoids the problems that let to the demise of this line of inquiry in the 1920s, as well as the problems of other social sciences applying their more narrowly focus models to sociological problems. Indeed, sociology can become a leader in the social sciences in developing more sophisticated theoretical and methodological approaches to incorporating biology and evolutionary analysis into the social sciences. When presented in a new, more sophisticated guise, old approaches like functionalism, stage models of societal evolution, and ecological models can be seen as still having a great deal of explanatory power, while revealing a progressive and future orientation that should appeal to all contemporary sociologists.

Median (IQR) age at ECMO implantation in this cohort was 12.7 (6.4, 43.2) months, median weight was 8.5 (6.0, 12.8) kg, mean ECMO duration was 143.2 ± 81.6 hours and mean hospital length of stay was 48.4 ± 32.4 days. Seventy-five patients (88.2%) were indicated for postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock. The successful ECMO weaning rate was 70.6% and in-hospital mortality was 52.9%. The most common diagnosis was transposition of great arteries (n = 18, 21.2%), while acute kidney injury occurred most often (n = 64, 75.3%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that thrombocytopenia, hemolysis, and nosocomial infection were positively correlated with in-hospital mortality. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis presented that thrombocytopenia significantly increased the 180-day mortality in patients with successful weaning. Therefore, multiple factors had adverse effects on prognosis. Patient selection and procedures from ECMO implantation to weaning need to be closely monitored and performed in a timely manner to improve outcome.",2020,"Jin, Yu; Feng, Zhengyi; Zhao, Ju; Hu, Jinxiao; Tong, Yuanyuan; Guo, Shengwen; Zhang, Peiyao; Bai, Liting; Li, Yixuan; Liu, Jinping",Artif. organs,nan,#637449,nan,nan,nan,nan,220473737.0

The study was aimed to explore the association between ivermectin prophylaxis and development of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers. Methods: A hospital-based matched case-control study was conducted among healthcare workers of AIIMS Bhubaneswar, India, from September to October 2020. Profession, gender, age and date of diagnosis were matched for 186 case-control pairs. Cases and controls were healthcare workers who tested positive and negative, respectively, for COVID-19 by RT-PCR. Exposure was defined as the intake of ivermectin and/or hydroxychloroquine and/or vitamin-C and/or other prophylaxis for COVID-19. Data collection and entry was done in Epicollect5, and analysis was performed using STATA version 13. Conditional logistic regression models were used to describe the associated factors for COVID-19 infection. Results: Ivermectin prophylaxis was taken by 77 controls and 38 cases. Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis (0.27, 95% CI, 0.15-0.51) was associated with 73% reduction of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers for the following one month, those who were involved in physical activity (3.06 95% CI, 1.18-7.93) for more than an hour/day were more likely to contract COVID-19 infection. Type of household, COVID duty, single-dose ivermectin prophylaxis, vitamin-C prophylaxis and hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis were not associated with COVID-19 infection. Conclusion: Two-dose ivermectin prophylaxis at a dose of 300 g/kg with a gap of 72 hours was associated 73% reduction of COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers for the following one-month.

AIMS To assess anxiety, well-being and post-traumatic growth in carers of children aged 6-16 years in Portugal and the UK. METHOD A cross-sectional online survey of volunteers conducted at the peak of the first wave of COVID-19 during lockdown (1 May to 27 June 2020). RESULTS A total of 385 caregivers (Portuguese, n = 185; UK, n = 200), predominantly mothers (n = 341, 88.6%), completed the survey. The majority were working exclusively from home (n = 271, 70.4%), almost half reported a reduction in income (n = 174, 45.2%), most children were home taught (n = 358, 93%), and 75 (19.5%) identified a family member with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. In total, 341 caregivers (88.6%) identified positives arising from COVID-19, most commonly related to the post-traumatic growth domains of improved relationships, a greater appreciation of life, discovering and embracing new possibilities, and positive spiritual change.

Since droplet transmission is the main route of transmission, wearing a mask serves as a crucial preventive measure. However, the virus has spread quite quickly, causing severe mask shortage. Finding alternative materials for homemade masks while ensuring the significant performance indicators will help alleviate the shortage of masks. Referring to the national standard for the ""Surgical Mask"" of China, 17 materials to be selected for homemade masks were tested in four key indicators: pressure difference, particle filtration efficiency, bacterial filtration efficiency and resistance to surface wetting. Eleven single-layer materials met the standard of pressure difference ([â¤]49 Pa), of which 3 met the standard of resistance to surface wetting ([â¥]3), 1 met the standard of particle filtration efficiency ([â¥]30%), but none met the standard of bacterial filtration efficiency ([â¥]95%).

Numerous investigations have demonstrated that portable air cleaning devices can reduce concentrations of asthma triggers in indoor air; however, their benefits for breathing problems have not always been reproducible. The potential exposure benefits of whole house high efficiency in-duct air cleaners for sensitive subpopulations have yet to be evaluated. METHODS: We used an indoor air quality modeling system (CONTAM) developed by NIST to examine peak and time-integrated concentrations of common asthma triggers present in indoor air over a year as a function of natural ventilation, portable air cleaners, and forced air ventilation equipped with conventional and high efficiency filtration systems. Emission rates for asthma triggers were based on experimental studies published in the scientific literature. RESULTS: Forced air systems with high efficiency filtration were found to provide the best control of asthma triggers: 30–55% lower cat allergen levels, 90–99% lower risk of respiratory infection through the inhalation route of exposure, 90–98% lower environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) levels, and 50–75% lower fungal spore levels than the other ventilation/filtration systems considered. These results indicate that the use of high efficiency in-duct air cleaners provide an effective means of controlling allergen levels not only in a single room, like a portable air cleaner, but the whole house. CONCLUSION: These findings are useful for evaluating potential benefits of high efficiency in-duct filtration systems for controlling exposure to asthma triggers indoors and for the design of trials of environmental interventions intended to evaluate their utility in practice.",2008-08-06,"Myatt, Theodore A; Minegishi, Taeko; Allen, Joseph G; MacIntosh, David L",Environ Health,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/52264dd990e495e82f511cfa80a14b52ec063722.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2543006.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-069x-7-43; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18684328/,12737689.0

Regulatory T-cells (T-regs) are associated with a tolerant immune state and may contribute to CMV-replication. However, T-cell subsets such as T-regs and IL-17 producing T-cells (Th-17) are not well studied in this context. We explored T-regs and Th-17 frequencies during CMV-replication after transplantation. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 30 transplant patients with CMV-viremia. We quantified CMV-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells, T-regs (CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+)) and Th-17 frequencies using flow-cytometry and followed patients requiring anti-viral treatment. Two subsets were compared: anti-viral treatment requirement (n = 20) vs. spontaneous clearance of viremia (n = 10). RESULTS: Higher initial CMV-specific CD4(+) T-cells and lower T-regs were observed in patients with spontaneous clearance (p = 0.043; p = 0.021 respectively). Using a ratio of CMV-specific CD4(+) T-cells to T-regs allowed prediction of viral clearance with 80% sensitivity and 90% specificity (p = 0.001). One month after stop of treatment, the same correlation was observed in patients protected from CMV-relapse. The ratio of CMV-specific CD4(+) T-cells to T-regs allowed prediction of relapse with 85% sensitivity and 86% specificity (p = 0.004). Th-17 responses were not correlated with virologic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel insights into T-regs and Th-17 subpopulations during CMV-replication after transplantation.

1rrax7he,nan,WHO,Virus-induced p38 MAPK activation facilitates viral infection,nan,nan,nan,unk,"Rationale: Many viral infections are known to activate the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. However, the role of p38 activation in viral infection and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. The role of virus-hijacked p38 MAPK activation in viral infection was investigated in this study. Methods: The correlation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and p38 activation was studied in patient tissues and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Coimmunoprecipitation, GST pulldown and confocal microscopy were used to investigate the interaction of p38&#945; and the HCV core protein. In vitro kinase assays and mass spectrometry were used to analyze the phosphorylation of the HCV core protein. Plaque assays, quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blotting, siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9 were used to determine the effect of p38 activation on viral replication. Results: HCV infection was associated with p38 activation in clinical samples. HCV infection increased p38 phosphorylation by triggering the interaction of p38&#945; and TGF-ß activated kinase 1 (MAP3K7) binding protein 1 (TAB1). TAB1-mediated p38&#945; activation facilitated HCV replication, and pharmaceutical inhibition of p38&#945; activation by SB203580 suppressed HCV infection at the viral assembly step. Activated p38&#945; interacted with the N-terminal region of the HCV core protein and subsequently phosphorylated the HCV core protein, which promoted HCV core protein oligomerization, an essential step for viral assembly. As expected, SB203580 or the HCV core protein N-terminal peptide (CN-peptide) disrupted the p38&#945;-HCV core protein interaction, efficiently impaired HCV assembly and impeded normal HCV replication in both cultured cells and primary human hepatocytes. Similarly, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection also activated p38 MAPK. Most importantly, pharmacological blockage of p38 activation by SB203580 effectively inhibited SFTSV, HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2.

Walking Blood Banks (WBB) provide fresh whole blood (FWB) where conventional blood components or stored, tested WB are not readily available. There is an increasing interest in this as an emergency resilience measure for isolated communities and during crises including the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available evidence to inform practice. METHODS Standard systematic review methodology was used to obtain studies that reported the delivery of FWB (PROSPERO registry CRD42019153849). Studies that only reported WB from conventional blood banking were excluded. For outcomes, odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random effects modelling due to high risk of heterogeneity. Quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE system. RESULTS 27 studies published from 2006 - 2020 reported >10,000 units of FWB for >3000 patients (precise values not available for all studies). Evidence for studies was ""low"" or ""very low"" except for one study which was ""moderate"" in quality. FWB patients were more severely injured than non-FWB patients. Overall, survival was equivalent between FWB and non-FWB groups for 8 studies that compared these (OR 1.00 (95% CI 0.65, 1.55); p=0.61). However, the highest quality study (matched groups for physiological and injury characteristics) reported an adjusted OR of 0.27 (95% CI 0.13-0.58) for mortality for the FWB group; p<0.01. CONCLUSIONS Thousands of units of FWB from WBBs have been transfused in patients following life-threatening haemorrhage. Survival is equivalent for FWB resuscitation when compared to non-FWB, even when patients were more severely injured. Evidence is scarce and of relative low quality and may underestimate potential adverse events. Whereas WBB may be an attractive resilience measure, caution is still advised. WBBs should be subject to prospective evaluation to optimise care and inform policy.

In order to study the collective effects of helping behavior in emergency evacuations, we have performed numerical simulations of helping behavior among evacuees in a room evacuation scenario. Our simulation model is based on the volunteer’s dilemma game reflecting volunteering cost. The game theoretic model is coupled with a social force model to understand the relationship between the spatial and social dynamics of evacuation scenarios. By systematically changing the cost parameter of helping behavior, we observed different patterns of collective helping behaviors and these collective patterns are summarized with a phase diagram.",2020-05-26,"Kwak, Jaeyoung; Lees, Michael H.; Cai, Wentong; Ong, Marcus E.

By late January 2020, it was evident that COVID-19 was rapidly spreading and represented a national health emergency. In order to contain the spread of COVID-19, China adopted a centralized treatment plan by appointing designated hospitals in each region. Shantou Central Hospital is a Grade A Class A general hospital in Guangdong Province. It was appointed as a provincial COVID-19 designated treatment hospital on January 21, 2020, to provide all COVID-19-related treatments for the city of Shantou. The nursing department at Shantou Central Hospital is fully responsible for hospital nursing administration, nursing human resource management, nursing quality management, and all nursing tasks related to hospital medical care, nursing, teaching, scientific research, preventive healthcare, and so on. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the role of nursing management in transforming a general hospital into a designated hospital for treatment of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We undertook a series of nursing management measures in the strategic phase and the implementation phase. FINDINGS: Through a series of nursing management measures, all COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital were cured and discharged. All non-COVID-19 patients and staff hospitalized during the same period were not infected with the virus. During this period, our hospital completed 7,466 operations. Hence, our nursing management measures were effective. CONCLUSIONS: Our efficient nursing management system, first of all, effectively mobilized all available manpower; secondly, up-skilled and trained personnel within a very short period of time; thirdly, provided reliable logistical support for front-line protection equipments; and finally, motivated nurses during this very difficult time to make a significant positive contribution to the fight against COVID-19 pandemic.",2020-06-29,"Wu, XiaoYing; Zheng, ShaoYan; Huang, JiaJia; Zheng, ZeLi; Xu, ManQing; Zhou, YuHua",Annals of global health,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/c6fc123e6a58564abd2d8ddc87852fd8ce58022a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7333556.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.2918; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32676299/,220526250.0

To improve the efficiency for visualizing capillaries, colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been applied as a multimodal contrast agent for both OCT and PAM imaging by taking advantage of the strong optical scattering and the strong optical absorption of AuNPs due to their surface plasmon resonance. Ultra-pure AuNPs were fabricated by femtosecond laser ablation, capped with polyethylene glycol (PEG), and administered to 13 New Zealand white rabbits and 3 Dutch Belted pigmented rabbits. The synthesized PEG-AuNPs (20.0 ± 1.5 nm) were demonstrated to be excellent contrast agents for PAM and OCT, and do not demonstrate cytotoxicity to bovine retinal endothelial cells in cell studies. The image signal from the retinal and choroidal vessels in living rabbits was enhanced by up to 82% for PAM and up to 45% for OCT, respectively, by the administered PEG-AuNPs, which enables detection of individual blood vessels by both imaging modalities. The biodistribution study demonstrated the AuNP accumulated primarily in the liver and spleen. Histology and TUNEL staining did not indicate cell injury or death in the lung, liver, kidney, spleen, heart, or eyes up to seven days after AuNP administration.

Nevertheless, the incidence of both acute and persisting viral infections without evidence of autoimmune sequelae suggests that this process is well controlled. The conditions promoting or stemming self-reactive (SR) T cells following viral-induced tissue damage thus need to be better defined. Using a non-fatal viral mouse model of encephalomyelitis associated with demyelination and disability, yet ultimate clinical improvement, this study set out to monitor uptake and presentation of endogenous myelin antigens, as well as induction and fate of SR T cells. METHODS: Activation and central nervous system (CNS) recruitment of myelin-specific CD4 T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry during encephalomyelitis induced by a glia tropic murine coronavirus. Potential antigen-presenting cells (APC) ingesting myelin were characterized by flow cytometry and their ability to activate SR T cells tested by co-culture with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled myelin-specific CD4 T cells. Endogenous SR T cell kinetics was analyzed within both cervical lymph nodes and CNS by Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpot (ELISPOT) following viral infection. RESULTS: The data demonstrate the presence of APC capable of activating SR T cells in both draining lymph nodes and the CNS temporally correlating with overt demyelination. While both the CNS-infiltrating myeloid population and microglia ingested myelin, only CNS-infiltrating APC were capable of presenting endogenous myelin antigen to SR T cells ex vivo. Finally, SR T cell activation from the endogenous T cell repertoire was most notable when infectious virus was controlled and paralleled myelin damage. Although SR T cell accumulation peaked in the persistently infected CNS during maximal demyelination, they were not preferentially retained. Their gradual decline, despite ongoing demyelination, suggested minimal re-stimulation and pathogenic function in vivo consistent with the lack of autoimmune symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the potential for CNS tissue destruction to induce and recruit SR T cells to the injury site and support a host suppressive mechanism limiting development of autoimmunity.",2015-11-11,"Savarin, Carine; Bergmann, Cornelia C.; Gaignage, Melanie; Stohlman, Stephen A.",J Neuroinflammation,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/055bc4fbdbbe262da7684e89ea4cfcc154a42291.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4642610.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26559484/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12974-015-0426-1,10990916.0

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: COVID-19 emergency shocked national health systems, subtracting resources from treatment of other diseases. Its impact on surgical oncology is still to elucidate. METHODS: A 56-question survey regarding the oncological surgical activity in Italy during the COVID-19 emergency was sent to referral centers for hepato-bilio-pancreatic, colorectal, esophago-gastric, and sarcoma/soft-tissue tumors. The survey portrays the situation 5 weeks after the first case of secondary transmission in Italy. RESULTS: In total, 54 surgical Units in 36 Hospitals completed the survey (95%). After COVID-19 emergency, 70% of Units had reduction of hospital beds (median -50%) and 76% of surgical activity (median -50%). The number of surgical procedures decreased: 3.8 (interquartile range 2.7-5.4) per week before the emergency versus 2.6 (22-4.4) after (P = 0.036). In Lombardy, the most involved district, the number decreased from 3.9 to 2 procedures per week. The time interval between multidisciplinary discussion and surgery more than doubled: 7 (6-10) versus 3 (3-4) weeks (P < 0.001). Two-third (n = 34) of departments had repeat multidisciplinary discussion of patients. The commonest criteria to prioritize surgery were tumor biology (80%), time interval from neoadjuvant therapy (61%), risk of becoming unresectable (57%), and tumor-related symptoms (52%). Oncological hub-and-spoke program was planned in 29 departments, but was active only in 10 (19%). CONCLUSIONS: This survey showed how surgical oncology suffered remarkable reduction of the activity resulting in doubled waiting-list. The oncological hub-and-spoke program did not work adequately.

Telemedicine is critical for neuro-oncology patients who may be at an increased risk of infection, yet require continuity of care. An important aspect of neuro-oncology care includes neuropsychological assessment, which can be challenging to complete outside of a structured testing environment. Teleneuropsychology (TNP) has been explored under proctored conditions and proven feasible and reliable. Conducting TNP visits directly to the patients’ home (DTH-TNP) had minimal study prior to the pandemic, but was implemented to reduce COVID-19 exposure. METHODS: We used surveys to examine patient acceptance and clinician feasibility of DTH-TNP at two regionally diverse medical institutions routinely providing neuropsychological assessments services to neuro-oncology patients from April to August 2020, Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). RESULTS: 45 patients voluntarily responded (MGH=30, VCU=15) and 98 percent (MGH=100%, VCU=93%) of respondents were satisfied with the DTH-TNP experience. Nine percent (MGH=7%, VCU=13%) reported challenges (e.g., technological issues) during the appointment. Eighty-nine percent (MGH=90%, VCU=87%) would recommend the virtual visit to others. Patients perceived reduced risk of infection (MGH=77%, VCU=87%) and time traveling to clinic (MGH=87%, VCU=80%) as favorable aspects of DTH-TNP. 43 clinician surveys collected at MGH indicated that clinicians were able to achieve the goal of their appointment in 91% of clinical encounters. Common issues reported by clinicians included trouble connecting (7%) to the telemedicine platform and environmental disruptions (12%). DISCUSSION: This preliminary data suggests neuro-oncology patients and clinicians find DTH-TNP to be an acceptable and feasible practice, while also recognizing its limitations. This study is limited in that voluntary patient surveys are subject to bias. These results suggest that further study of DTH-TNP (e.g., reliability, validity, and limitations) for neuro-oncology patients is warranted.

Global studies have indicated that the length of hospitalisation depends on different factors, such as the time elapsed from exposure to symptom onset, and from symptom onset to hospital admission, as well as specificities of the country under study. The goal of this paper is to identify factors associated with the median duration of hospital stays of COVID-19 patients during the second COVID-19 wave that hit Vietnam from 5 March to 8 April 2020. METHOD: We used retrospective data on 133 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 recorded over at least two weeks during the study period. The Cox proportional-hazards regression model was applied to determine the potential risk factors associated with length of hospital stay. RESULTS: There were 65 (48.9%) females, 98 (73.7%) patients 48 years old or younger, 15 (11.3%) persons with comorbidities, 21 (16.0%) severely ill patients and 5 (3.8%) individuals with life-threatening conditions. Eighty-two (61.7%) patients were discharged after testing negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 51 were still in the hospital at the end of the study period and none died. The median duration of stay in a hospital was 21 (IQR: 16-34) days.

This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of liver blood tests in COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: The analysis included clinical data of 23 patients with suspected COVID‐19 and 66 patients with confirmed COVID‐19 from January 25 to February 20, 2020. The relationship between liver blood test results, liver condition (HBsAb positive, HBcAb positive, and fatty liver disease), and duration of hospital stay among COVID‐19 patients was analyzed. RESULTS: The median hospital stay of COVID‐19 patients was 6 days. Serum albumin (Alb) level was lower in patients with COVID‐19 confirmed on admission than in patients with suspected COVID‐19 (40.08 g/L vs 42.50 g/L, P = .016), while the level of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was higher (23 U/L vs 18 U/L, P = .005). Abnormal results of liver blood tests in patients with COVID‐19 included increased levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) (21.2%, 14 patients), AST (15.2%, 10 patients), and gamma‐glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) (22.7%, 15 patients). After 5‐10 days of treatment, levels of Alb and AST in COVID‐19 patients were significantly decreased (P < .001 and P = .027, respectively). Abnormal levels of Alb and AST in patients with COVID‐19 were not associated with the liver condition (all P > .05). In addition, only levels of AST were positively correlated with the duration of hospital stay (r = .334, P = .007).

It can be demonstrated that its origins and development literally run the gamut from A to Z, that is to say, from Aristotle to Zoobiquity. Indeed, the consequences of the interaction that occurs between ecosystems, animals and people have shaped, and continue to shape, the course of human events and history. A reasoned and evidence-based assessment of the history of One Health must first be founded on an agreed definition of the term, but, given the many disciplines and sciences involved, finding such a definition is no easy task. Furthermore, there is an extensive and growing list of visionary individuals who have, over the centuries, attempted to promote awareness and advance the conceptto improve the management of the risks and consequences that arise at the interface between animal, human and ecosystem health. The One Health ideas of the 21st Century constitute a re-conceptualisation of health management in response to the accelerating environmental changes of the past 100 years, changes that are associated with the parallel exponential growth and concentration of the global human population.

Clinical impact of Tocilizumab therapy in SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections in ICU and non-ICU patients,10.1093/ofid/ofaa439.744,PMC7777636,nan,cc-by-nc-nd,"BACKGROUND: Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a monoclonal antibody against the interleuikin-6 receptor which is potentially beneficial in COVID-19 induced cytokine release syndrome (CRS). However, there are limited studies showing anti-inflammatory effect and clinical benefit of TCZ in COVID-19 patients. This retrospective study examines treatment responses of criteria based TCZ therapy for SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection for ICU vs. non-ICU patients. METHODS: We established institutional criteria to identify patients at risk of CRS from COVID-19. Patients were included if they received at least 1 dose of TCZ and were admitted for at least 72 hours. Primary endpoint was to assess clinical improvement (CI) at the end of admission. CI was defined by extubation, downgrade from ICU, discharged or improvement in Clinical Ordinal Scale by 2. Secondary endpoint of the study was to assess inpatient mortality (IM) and risk factors associated with IM. Subgroup analysis included impact of early (< 96 hours) vs late (≥ 96 hours) TCZ therapy on IM. RESULTS: Between March 25 to May 6, 2020, 170 patients met criteria and received TCZ. There were 83 non-ICU patients and 87 in the ICU. Forty five patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). ICU patients tended to be obese, receive 2 doses of TCZ and have longer length of stay. Overall CI was seen in 71% of patients. CI was higher in non-ICU vs ICU patients (85.5% vs 57.5%, P=0.002). Overall IM was 18.8%; however, IM was lower in non-ICU vs ICU patients (8.4% vs 28.7%, P=0.0014). IM was higher in patients on IMV vs. non-IMV (30% vs 15.4%, P=0.03). Risk factors of ICU admission, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and AKI were associated with higher risk of IM. Many IM patients were made comfort care. No differences were observed in early vs late TCZ therapy on inpatient mortality, but there was a trend toward lower mortality with early TCZ. COS Review of Tocilizumab Patients [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: TCZ is an effective treatment option in patients with SARS-CoV-2 patients at risk of CRS. Patients receiving TCZ in non-ICU setting had a better response to treatment compared to ICU patients. Obesity and AKI were associated with higher risk of mortality, but there was no statistical difference in early vs late therapy. Further studies with control group and larger sample size are warranted.

Predictive studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with emergence. However, emerging pathogens vary widely in virulence, a key determinant of their ultimate risk to public health. Here, we use structured literature searches to review the virulence of each of the 214 known human-infective RNA virus species. We then use a machine learning framework to determine whether viral virulence can be predicted by ecological traits, including human-to-human transmissibility, transmission routes, tissue tropisms, and host range. Using severity of clinical disease as a measurement of virulence, we identified potential risk factors using predictive classification tree and random forest ensemble models. The random forest approach predicted literature-assigned disease severity of test data with mean accuracy of 89.4% compared to a null accuracy of 74.2%. In addition to viral taxonomy, the ability to cause systemic infection was the strongest predictor of severe disease. Further notable predictors of severe disease included having neural and/or renal tropism, direct contact or respiratory transmission, and limited (0 < R(0) ≤ 1) human-to-human transmissibility. We present a novel, to our knowledge, comparative perspective on the virulence of all currently known human RNA virus species. The risk factors identified may provide novel perspectives in understanding the evolution of virulence and elucidating molecular virulence mechanisms.

We determined the patency rates of the anterior choroidal artery after placement of flow-diversion devices across its ostium. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed a consecutive series of patients in whom a Pipeline Embolization Device was placed across the ostium of an angiographically visible anterior choroidal artery while treating the target aneurysm. Patency of the anterior choroidal artery after Pipeline Embolization Device placement was determined at immediate postoperative and follow-up angiography. Data on pretreatment aneurysm rupture status, concomitant coiling, number of Pipeline Embolization Devices used, neurologic status at follow-up, and follow-up MR imaging/CT findings were collected. RESULTS Fifteen patients with 15 treated aneurysms were included in this study. In the immediate postprocedural setting, the anterior choroidal artery was patent on posttreatment angiography for all 15 patients. Of the 14 patients with follow-up angiography at least 6 months after Pipeline Embolization Device placement, 1 (7%) had occlusion of the anterior choroidal artery and 14 had a patent anterior choroidal artery (93%). No patients had new neurologic symptoms or stroke related to anterior choroidal artery occlusion at follow-up. Of the 9 patients with follow-up CT or MR imaging, none had infarction in the vascular territory of the anterior choroidal artery.

METHODS: A regression model is adopted to quantify the association between the SARS-CoV-2 detection delay and calendar time. The association is tested and further validated by a Cox proportional hazard model. FINDINGS: The estimated median detection delay was 9.5 days (95%CI: 6.5-11.5) in the second half of January, reduced to 6.0 days (95%CI: 5.5-9.5) in the first half of February 2020.

Can statistical representations, such as memory for the central tendency along a particular visual feature dimension, be extracted from information held in the sensory register?

We focused on the potential role of visible persistence mechanisms that support temporal integration. We tested whether mean orientation could be accurately recalled from brief visual displays using the successive field task. On separate blocks of trials, participants were asked to report the location of a split element (requiring differentiation of frames), a missing element (requiring integration across frames), and the average orientation of elements pooled across both frames (central tendency recall). Results replicate the expected tradeoff between differentiation and integration performance across inter-frame interval (IFI). In contrast, precision of mean estimates was high and invariant across IFIs. A manipulation of within-frame distributional similarity coupled with simulations using 12 models supported 2-item subsampling. The results argue against the “strategic” interpretation of subsampling since 2-item readout was predicted by information theoretic estimates of STM encoding rate: the 2 items were not from a superset in STM. Most crucially, the results argue against the various early “preattentive/parallel/global pooling” accounts and instead suggest that non-selective readout of information from iconic memory supplies a relatively small amount of item information to STM, and it is only at this point that the computation of ensemble averages begins.",2021-01-03,"Zepp, Jacob; Dubé, Chad; Melcher, David",Atten Percept Psychophys,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/51cd9d11d84b96d7baf29ac3f4e96004a24bc286.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7778862.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3758/s13414-020-02187-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33389675/,230421907.0

Yet, the considerable difference in the incidence of COVID‐19 between different geographic regions may affect screening strategies. Therefore, we aimed to compare questionnaire‐based testing versus universal PCR testing for SARS‐CoV‐2 in women admitted for delivery. METHODS: A prospective cohort study of women admitted for delivery at a single center during a four‐week period (April 22‐May 25, 2020). All women completed a questionnaire about COVID‐19 signs, symptoms, or risk factors, and a nasopharyngeal swab for PCR for SARS‐CoV‐2. Women who were flagged as suspected COVID‐19 by the questionnaire (questionnaire‐positive) were compared with women who were not flagged by the questionnaire (questionnaire‐negative). RESULTS: Overall, 446 women were eligible for analysis, of which 54 (12.1%) were questionnaire‐positive. PCR swab detected SARS‐CoV‐2 in four (0.9%) women: 3 of 392 (0.8%) in the questionnaire‐negative group, and 1 of 54 (1.9%) in the questionnaire‐positive group (P = .43), yielding a number needed to screen of 92 (95% CI 62‐177). In 96% of the cases, the PCR results were obtained only in the postpartum period. No positive PCR results were obtained from neonatal testing for SARS‐CoV‐2. The sensitivity of the questionnaire was 75.0%, and the negative predictive value was 99.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Although the rate of positive PCR results was not significantly different between the groups, the number needed to screen is considerably high. The use of questionnaire‐based PCR testing in areas with low incidence of COVID‐19 allows for a reasonable allocation of resources and is easy to implement.",2020-12-01,"Mei‐Dan, Elad; Satkunaratnam, Abheha; Cahan, Tal; Leung, Marian; Katz, Kevin; Aviram, Amir",Birth,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/d6783107900cd2226c1f6c376bcf181805cf746f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7753601.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1111/birt.12520; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33263210/,227251309.0

Methods We searched Medline, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, Academic Search Premier, Africa-Wide Information, CINAHL, OTSeeker and PEDro with search terms in four broad areas: upper limb, intervention, workplace and clinical trial (no date limits). Studies including neck pain only or musculoskeletal pain in other areas were not included. Results Initial search located 1071 articles, of which 80 were full text reviewed. Twenty-eight articles were included, reporting on various outcomes relating to a total of seventeen studies. Nine studies were of high methodological quality, seven of medium quality, and one of low quality. Studies were sorted into intervention categories: Ergonomic controls (n = 3), ergonomic training and workstation adjustments (n = 4), exercise and resistance training (n = 6), clinic-based versus workplace-based work hardening (n = 1), nurse case manager training (n = 1), physiotherapy versus Feldenkrais (n = 1), and ambulant myofeedback training (n = 1). The largest body of evidence supported workplace exercise programs, with positive effects for ergonomic training and workstation adjustments, and mixed effects for ergonomic controls. Ambulant myofeedback training had no effect. The remaining three categories had positive effects in the single study on each intervention.

While the medical research area dedicates efforts to find cures and remedies to counteract the effects of a virus, the engineering area is involved in providing risk assessments in indoor environments by simulating the airborne transmission of the virus during an epidemic. To this end, virus air emission data are needed. Unfortunately, this information is usually available only after the outbreak, based on specific reverse engineering cases. In this work, a novel approach to estimate the viral load emitted by a contagious subject on the basis of the viral load in the mouth, the type of respiratory activity (e.g. breathing, speaking, whispering), respiratory physiological parameters (e.g. inhalation rate), and activity level (e.g. resting, standing, light exercise) is proposed. The results showed that high quanta emission rates (>100 quanta h-1) can be reached by an asymptomatic infectious SARS-CoV-2 subject performing vocalization during light activities (i.e. walking slowly) whereas a symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 subject in resting conditions mostly has a low quanta emission rate (<1 quantum h-1). The findings in terms of quanta emission rates were then adopted in infection risk models to demonstrate its application by evaluating the number of people infected by an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 subject in Italian indoor microenvironments before and after the introduction of virus containment measures. The results obtained from the simulations clearly highlight that a key role is played by proper ventilation in containment of the virus in indoor environments.",2020,"Buonanno, G; Stabile, L; Morawska, L",Environ Int,nan,#273030,nan,nan,nan,nan,216055404.0

The purpose of this study was to document the magnitude of that effect by examining (a) the amount of psychologists' telepsychology use before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the pandemic, and anticipated use after the pandemic; as well as (b) the demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice predictors of these changes. This study used a cross-sectional, national online design to recruit 2,619 licensed psychologists practicing in the United States. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists performed 7.07% of their clinical work with telepsychology, which increased 12-fold to 85.53% during the pandemic, with 67.32% of psychologists conducting all of their clinical work with telepsychology. Psychologists projected that they would perform 34.96% of their clinical work via telepsychology after the pandemic. Psychologists working in outpatient treatment facilities reported over a 26-fold increase in telepsychology use during the pandemic, while those in Veterans Affairs medical centers only reported a sevenfold increase. A larger increase in percentage telepsychology use occurred in women, in psychologists who reported an increase in telepsychology training and supportive organizational telepsychology policies, and in psychologists who treated relationship issues, anxiety, and women's issues. The lowest increases in percentage telepsychology use were reported by psychologists working in rural areas, treating antisocial personality disorder, performing testing and evaluation, and treating rehabilitation populations. Although there was a remarkable increase in telepsychology use during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual and practice characteristics affected psychologists' ability to adopt telepsychology.

Using our system, we specifically sever titin by digestion with TEV protease, and find that the response of muscle fibers to length changes requires mechanical transduction through titin's intact polypeptide chain. In addition, HaloTag-based covalent tethering enables examination of titin dynamics under force using magnetic tweezers. At pulling forces < 10 pN, titin domains are recruited to the unfolded state, and produce 41.5 zJ mechanical work during refolding.

mgdsspmv,nan,WHO,PEPFAR's response to the convergence of the HIV and COVID-19 pandemics in Sub-Saharan Africa,nan,nan,nan,unk,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic reached the African continent in less than three months from when the first cases were reported from mainland China. As COVID-19 preparedness and response plans were rapidly instituted across sub-Saharan Africa, many governments and donor organizations braced themselves for the unknown impact the COVID-19 pandemic would have in under-resourced settings with high burdens of PLHIV. The potential negative impact of COVID-19 in these countries is uncertain, but is estimated to contribute both directly and indirectly to the morbidity and mortality of PLHIV, requiring countries to leverage existing HIV care systems to propel COVID-19 responses, while safeguarding PLHIV and HIV programme gains. In anticipation of COVID-19-related disruptions, PEPFAR promptly established guidance to rapidly adapt HIV programmes to maintain essential HIV services while protecting recipients of care and staff from COVID-19. This commentary reviews PEPFAR's COVID-19 technical guidance and provides country-specific examples of programme adaptions in sub-Saharan Africa. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic may pose significant risks to the continuity of HIV services, especially in countries with high HIV prevalence and weak and over-burdened health systems. Although there is currently limited understanding of how COVID-19 affects PLHIV, it is imperative that public health systems and academic centres monitor the impact of COVID-19 on PLHIV. The general principles of the HIV programme adaptation guidance from PEPFAR prioritize protecting the gains in the HIV response while minimizing in-person home and facility visits and other direct contact when COVID-19 control measures are in effect. PEPFAR-supported clinical, laboratory, supply chain, community and data reporting systems can play an important role in mitigating the impact of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa. CONCLUSIONS: As community transmission of COVID-19 continues and the number of country cases rise, fragile health systems may be strained. Utilizing the adaptive, data-driven programme approaches in facilities and communities established and supported by PEPFAR provides the opportunity to strengthen the COVID-19 response while protecting the immense gains spanning HIV prevention, testing and treatment reached thus far.",2020,"Golin, Rachel; Godfrey, Catherine; Firth, Jacqueline; Lee, Lana; Minior, Thomas; Phelps, B Ryan; Raizes, Elliot G; Ake, Julie A; Siberry, George K",J Int AIDS Soc,nan,#641138,nan,nan,nan,nan,220971215.0

In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of synonymous codon usage bias in 41 available TTSuV2 coding sequences (CDS), and compared the codon usage patterns of TTSuV2 and TTSuV1. TTSuV codon usage patterns were found to be phylogenetically conserved. Values for the effective number of codons (ENC) indicated that the overall extent of codon usage bias in both TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 was not significant, the most frequently occurring codons had an A or C at the third codon position. Correspondence analysis (COA) was performed and TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 sequences were located in different quadrants of the first two major axes. A plot of the ENC revealed that compositional constraint was the major factor determining the codon usage bias for TTSuV2. In addition, hierarchical cluster analysis of 41 TTSuV2 isolates based on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values suggested that there was no association between geographic distribution and codon bias of TTSuV2 sequences. Finally, the comparison of RSCU for TTSuV2, TTSuV1 and the corresponding host sequence indicated that the codon usage pattern of TTSuV2 was similar to that of TTSuV1.

It is again being applied, after earlier failures, because well-trained teams and improved equipment and techniques are available following the success of neonatal ECMO. In addition, in Europe extracorporeal CO(2) removal (ECCO(2)R) in adults has been more successful. The use of ECMO for pulmonary failure in children does not have fixed indications and has had considerably less success than neonatal ECMO. Patients who require inspired oxygen fractions of over 0.5 and positive end-expiratory pressures of over 6 cm H(2)O for more than 12 h after being treated for more than 48 h should be considered candidates, given the high mortality of children with ARDS (70%). Survival averages 50% to 60%. Circuits and patient management techniques are very similar to those for newborn ECMO, but patients usually require longer times on ECMO. There are many more options for cannulation for both venoarterial and venovenous techniques than in neonatal and cardiac ECMO.

These functions of FcγRn depend on the intracellular signal transduction and activation caused by the combination of its extracellular domain and IgG Fc domain. Nevertheless, there are still no kinetic studies on this interaction. Consequently, in the present study, we successfully constructed the human FcγRn (hFcγRn) electrochemical receptor sensor. The signal amplification system formed by chitosan nanogold-hFcγRn protein and horseradish peroxidase was used to simulate the cell signal amplification system in vivo, and the kinetic effects between seven IgG and hFcγRn receptors from different species were quantitatively measured. The results showed that the interaction of these seven IgGs with hFcγRn was similar to the catalytic kinetics of enzyme and substrate, and there was a ligand-receptor saturation effect. The order of the interconnect allosteric constants (K(a)), which is similar to the Michaelis constant (K(m)), was human IgG < bovine IgG < horse IgG < rabbit IgG < sheep IgG < donkey IgG < quail IgY. The results showed that hFcγRn had the strongest ability to transport human IgG, which was consistent with the evolution of the system. Therefore, our hFcγRn electrochemical receptor sensor can be used to measure and evaluate the interconnected allosteric network. It is also an essential parameter of the interaction between hFcγRn and different IgGs and, thus, provides a new detection and evaluation method for immunoemulsion, therapeutic monoclonal antibody therapy, heteroantibody treatment, and half-life research.",2020-07-14,"Peng, Dandan; Lu, Dingqiang; Pang, Guangchang",Molecules,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/fd83f6b01ffd5f1bc14713c3e022193d0b3c5b03.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7397135.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25143206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32674374/,220607781.0

Various simulation-based studies have been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of these measures. While those studies unanimously confirm the mitigating effect of social distancing on disease spread, the reported effectiveness varies from 10% to more than 90% reduction in the number of infections. This level of uncertainty is mostly due to the complex dynamics of epidemics and their time-variant parameters. However, real transactional data can reduce uncertainty and provide a less noisy picture of the effectiveness of social distancing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to integrate multiple transactional data sets (GPS mobility data from Google and Apple as well as disease statistics from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) to study the role of social distancing policies in 26 countries and analyze the transmission rate of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic over the course of 5 weeks. METHODS: Relying on the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and official COVID-19 reports, we first calculated the weekly transmission rate (β) of COVID-19 in 26 countries for 5 consecutive weeks. Then, we integrated these data with the Google and Apple mobility data sets for the same time frame and used a machine learning approach to investigate the relationship between the mobility factors and β values. RESULTS: Gradient boosted trees regression analysis showed that changes in mobility patterns resulting from social distancing policies explain approximately 47% of the variation in the disease transmission rates. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with simulation-based studies, real cross-national transactional data confirms the effectiveness of social distancing interventions in slowing the spread of COVID-19. In addition to providing less noisy and more generalizable support for the idea of social distancing, we provide specific insights for public health policy makers regarding locations that should be given higher priority for enforcing social distancing measures.",2020-05-28,"Delen, Dursun; Eryarsoy, Enes; Davazdahemami, Behrooz",JMIR Public Health Surveill,nan,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7257477.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.2196/19862; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32434145/,218766351.0

Participants from the Intracoronary Abciximab and Aspiration Thrombectomy in Patients with Large Anterior Myocardial Infarction study were categorized according to smoking status (current or previous smoking vs no history of smoking). The primary imaging outcome was cardiac magnetic resonance imaging-assessed IS of left ventricular mass (%) at 30 days. The primary clinical outcome was the rate of MACE at 30 days and 1 year, defined as the composite of death, reinfarction, new-onset heart failure, or rehospitalization. Of 447 patients enrolled in Intracoronary Abciximab and Aspiration Thrombectomy in Patients with Large Anterior Myocardial Infarction, 271 (60.6%) were current or past smokers. Compared with nonsmokers, smokers were almost 10 years younger and had a lower prevalence of clinical co-morbidities. Smokers had better procedural success and angiographic reperfusion compared with nonsmokers. At 30 days, there were no differences between smokers and nonsmokers in median IS (16.8% vs 17.4%, p = 0.67) or metrics of left ventricular function. By multivariable linear regression analysis, smoking was not significantly associated with IS at 30 days (beta coefficient: 0.83, p = 0.42). At 1 year, smokers had lower crude rates of MACE (7.6% vs 15%, p = 0.01). After multivariable adjustment, there were no significant differences in 1-year MACE between smokers and nonsmokers (adjusted hazard ratio 0.73, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.33, p = 0.30). In conclusion, smoking history had no significant effect on IS at 30 days. Although current or previous smokers had lower rates of 1-year MACE than those with no history of smoking, adjustment for baseline characteristics rendered this association nonsignificant.

The clinical evaluation of the febrile patient with a potential emerging viral pathogen involves documenting the likelihood for an infection by a detailed travel history, calculation of an incubation time by exposure, and an understanding of the disease progression though the clinical illness, which drives the differential diagnosis and the type of diagnostics ordered.

This article notes the difference between price spreads and marketing margins, outlines corresponding economic theory, and describes the empirical evidence on wholesale meat and livestock price dynamics in the wake of COVID-19 disruptions. At one point during the pandemic, beef and pork packers were both operating at about 60% of the previous year's processing volume. We explore how such a massive supply shock would be expected to affect marketing margins even in the absence of anti-competitive behavior.

Convalescent serum and blood were used to treat patients during outbreaks of Zaire ebolavirus (ZEBOV) infection in 1976 and 1995, with inconclusive results.

The effectiveness of this strategy remains unknown. Methods. Nine rhesus monkeys were experimentally infected with ZEBOV-Makona. Beginning on day 3 after exposure (at the onset of viremia), 4 animals were treated with homologous ZEBOV-Makona convalescent macaque sera, 3 animals were treated in parallel with heterologous Sudan ebolavirus (SEBOV) convalescent macaque sera, and 2 animals served as positive controls and were not treated.

The goals of this study were: (1) to describe the pattern of change in lower-extremity functional status of patients over a 1-year period after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and (2) to describe the effect of preoperative functional status on change over time. SUBJECTS Eighty-four patients (44 female, 40 male) with osteoarthritis, mean age of 66 years (SD=9), participated. METHODS Repeated measurements for the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) and the Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) were taken over a 1-year period. Data were plotted to examine the pattern of change over time. Different models of recovery were explored using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling that accounted for preoperative status and gender. RESULTS Growth curves were generated that depict the rate and amount of change in LEFS scores and 6MWT distances up to 1 year following TKA. The curves account for preoperative status and gender differences across participants. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION The greatest improvement occurred in the first 12 weeks after TKA. Slower improvement continued to occur from 12 weeks to 26 weeks after TKA, and little improvement occurred beyond 26 weeks after TKA.

METHODS In a 2-month prospective, observational, resident-led nationwide cohort study, patients undergoing laparoscopic appendectomy for both uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis were analysed. Logistic regression analyses were performed for identifying the possible effect of stump closure type and other risk factors for infectious complications. RESULTS Laparoscopic appendectomy for acute appendicitis was performed in 1369 patients in 62 hospitals; endoloops were used in 76.7 % and an endostapler in other patients. Median operating time was not different between endoloop and endostapler use (42.0 vs. 44.0 min, P = 0.243). A superficial surgical site infection was seen in 2.0 % after uncomplicated appendicitis and in 0.8 % after complicated appendicitis. The intra-abdominal abscess rate was 1.9 % after uncomplicated and 11.0 % after complicated appendicitis. No significant effect of stump closure type was observed for any infectious complication (OR 1.05; 95 % CI 0.625-1.766, P = 0.853) or an intra-abdominal abscess (OR OR 0.96; 95 % CI 0.523-1.768, P = 0.899). In multivariable analysis, complicated appendicitis was identified as the only independent risk factor for an intra-abdominal abscess (OR 6.26; 95 % CI 3.454-11.341, P < 0.001).

As COVID-19 alerts us to shift science education to digital when in-person schooling is not viable, one approach to facilitate this shift, as reviewed by Zacharia et al. (2015), is to involve students in computer supported inquiry learning (CoSIL) with appropriate guidance. As CoSIL guidance is critical to student success in CoSIL, Zacharia et al. (2015) contribute to our knowledge by systematically reviewing the forms and the efficacy of such guidance tools that are associated with each phase of scientific inquiry. With such knowledge we may develop decent guidance so that students can experience scientific inquiry virtually as they used to do in-person. Zacharia et al. (2015) indicated that the various guidance tools had increased the ease of use of CoSIL but failed in personalizing CoSIL to individual students. I agree with Zacharia et al. that the personalization of CoSIL guidance is vital. Further, I argue that the emergent machine learning may significantly increase the personalization of CoSIL without burdening teachers.

It has been recommend as an assessment tool that allows anesthetic providers in developing countries to assess their compliance and needs. This study was performed to describe the anesthesia service in one main public hospital during an 8-month medical mission in Cambodia and evaluate its anesthetic safety issues according to the ISSPA. METHODS: We conduct a retrospective study involving 1953 patients at the Preah Ket Mealea hospital. Patient demographics, anesthetic techniques, and complications were reviewed according to the registers of the anesthetic services and questionnaires. The inadequacies in personnel, facilities, equipment, medications, and conduct of anesthesia drugs were recorded using a checklist based on the ISSPA. RESULTS: A total of 1792 patients received general and regional anesthesia in the operating room, while 161 patients receiving sedation for gastroscopy. The patients’ mean age was 45.0 ± 16.6 years (range, 17–87 years). The three most common surgical procedures were abdominal (52.0%; confidence interval [CI], 49.3–54.7), orthopedic (27.6%; CI, 25.2–29.9), and urological surgery (14.7%; CI, 12.8–16.6).

Twenty-six items related to professional aspects, monitoring, and conduct of anesthesia did not meet the ISSPA-recommended standards. A lack of commonly used drugs and monitoring equipment was noted, posing major threats to the safety of anesthesia practice, especially in emergency situations.

Severe dysregulated systemic inflammation is the putative mechanism. We hypothesize that early prolonged methylprednisolone (MP) treatment could accelerate disease resolution, decreasing the need for ICU and mortality. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, observational study to explore the association between exposure to prolonged, low-dose, MP treatment and need for ICU referral, intubation or death within 28 days (composite primary endpoint) in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to Italian respiratory high-dependency units. Secondary outcomes were invasive MV-free days and changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. RESULTS: Findings are reported as MP (n=83) vs. control (n=90). The composite primary endpoint was met by 19 vs. 40 [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.41; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.24-0.72]. Transfer to ICU and need for invasive MV was necessary in 15 vs. 27 (p=0.07) and 14 vs. 26 (p=0.10), respectively. By day 28, the MP group had fewer deaths (6 vs. 21, adjusted HR=0.29; 95% CI: 0.12-0.73) and more days off invasive MV (24.0 ± 9.0 vs. 17.5 ± 12.8; p=0.001). Study treatment was associated with rapid improvement in PaO(2):FiO(2) and CRP levels. The complication rate was similar for the two groups (p=0.84). CONCLUSION: In patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early administration of prolonged MP treatment was associated with a significantly lower hazard of death (71%) and decreased ventilator dependence. Treatment was safe and did not impact viral clearance. A large RCT (RECOVERY trial) has been performed that validates these findings.

These tasks have been almost lost with the industrial manufacturing, and dispensing remains the main activity of pharmacists. Hospital pharmacists are usually employees in their workplace, while the professional framework of community pharmacists is very different, being pharmacies predominantly private shops in almost all European countries. In the last years pharmacists have strongly advocated that the focus of their services should switch from ‘product’ to ‘patient’. Clinical pharmacy and pharmaceutical care are the two most cited concepts to support this shift. Clinical pharmacy was originally defined as the area of pharmacy concerned with the science and practice of rational medication use, pharmaceutical care as the responsible provision of drug therapies to achieve definite outcomes. The practice of clinical pharmacy should embrace the philosophy of pharmaceutical care. The new wave of pharmacists’ patient-centered care in Europe still seems to be a reaction against the loss of their traditional professional role after the drug manufacturing revolution. To depict a realistic scenario for progress, it is worth differentiating between hospital and community. Hospital pharmacists should strengthen their pivotal role of medication gatekeepers to improve among clinicians the appropriateness of drug prescriptions and generate savings in expenditures. Any proposal for clinical services provided by community pharmacists is inevitably affected by the issue of their potential remuneration, especially in countries where the remuneration for reimbursable drugs is still a proportion of the retail price.",2020-09-13,"Garattini, Livio; Padula, Anna; Mannucci, Pier Mannuccio",Intern Emerg Med,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/8157e722b4bac0d7ee5d90e1ce0d3ce36edafbea.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7487142.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-020-02496-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32920655/,221644222.0

During highly infectious outbreaks, acute resuscitation scenarios may also increase the risk of insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) use by health care workers (HCWs). Simulation was used as an educational tool to measure adherence with PPE use and pediatric resuscitation guidelines during simulated cardiopulmonary arrests of 2009 influenza A patients. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was performed of 84 HCWs participating in 11 in situ simulations in June 2009. Assessment included (1) PPE adherence, (2) confidence in PPE use, (3) elapsed time to specific resuscitation maneuvers, and (4) deviation from AHA guidelines. RESULTS: Observed adherence with PPE use was 61% for eye shields, 81% for filtering facepiece respirators or powered air-purifying respirators, and 87% for gown/gloves. Use of a “gatekeeper” to control access and facilitate donning of PPE was associated with 100% adherence with gown and respirator precautions and improved respirator adherence. All simulations showed deviation from pediatric basic life support protocols. The median time to bag-valve-mask ventilation improved from 4.3 to 2.7 minutes with a gatekeeper present. Rapid isolation carts appeared to improve access to necessary PPE. Confidence in PPE use improved from 64% to 85% after the mock code and structured debriefing.

We presented crowdworkers with two problems in each domain and asked them to provide three explanations about why one problem is more challenging than the other. These explanations were then independently analyzed through (1) a series of qualitative coding methods and (2) several topic modeling techniques, to compare how they might assist in extracting KCs and other insights from the participant contributions. Results of our qualitative coding showed that crowdworkers were able to generate KCs that approximately matched those generated by domain experts. At the same time, the topic models’ outputs were evaluated against both the domain expert generated KCs and the results of the previous coding to determine effectiveness.

qd98au8o,nan,WHO,No Place Like Home: Cross-National Data Analysis of the Efficacy of Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic,nan,nan,nan,unk,"BACKGROUND: In the absence of a cure in the time of a pandemic, social distancing measures seem to be the most effective intervention to slow the spread of disease. Various simulation-based studies have been conducted to investigate the effectiveness of these measures. While those studies unanimously confirm the mitigating effect of social distancing on disease spread, the reported effectiveness varies from 10% to more than 90% reduction in the number of infections. This level of uncertainty is mostly due to the complex dynamics of epidemics and their time-variant parameters. However, real transactional data can reduce uncertainty and provide a less noisy picture of the effectiveness of social distancing. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to integrate multiple transactional data sets (GPS mobility data from Google and Apple as well as disease statistics from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) to study the role of social distancing policies in 26 countries and analyze the transmission rate of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic over the course of 5 weeks. METHODS: Relying on the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model and official COVID-19 reports, we first calculated the weekly transmission rate (ß) of COVID-19 in 26 countries for 5 consecutive weeks. Then, we integrated these data with the Google and Apple mobility data sets for the same time frame and used a machine learning approach to investigate the relationship between the mobility factors and ß values. RESULTS: Gradient boosted trees regression analysis showed that changes in mobility patterns resulting from social distancing policies explain approximately 47% of the variation in the disease transmission rates. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with simulation-based studies, real cross-national transactional data confirms the effectiveness of social distancing interventions in slowing the spread of COVID-19. In addition to providing less noisy and more generalizable support for the idea of social distancing, we provide specific insights for public health policy makers regarding locations that should be given higher priority for enforcing social distancing measures.",2020,"Delen, Dursun; Eryarsoy, Enes; Davazdahemami, Behrooz",JMIR Public Health Surveill,nan,#32434145,nan,nan,nan,nan,218766351.0

Human neutralizing antibodies (hNAbs) that target the host ACE2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike1-5 show therapeutic promise and are being evaluated clincally6-8. To determine structural correlates of SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, we solved 8 new structures of distinct COVID-19 hNAbs5 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimer or RBD. Structural comparisons allowed classification into categories: (1) VH3-53 hNAbs with short CDRH3s that block ACE2 and bind only to ""up"" RBDs, (2) ACE2-blocking hNAbs that bind both ""up"" and ""down"" RBDs and can contact adjacent RBDs, (3) hNAbs that bind outside the ACE2 site and recognize ""up"" and ""down"" RBDs, and (4) Previously-described antibodies that do not block ACE2 and bind only ""up"" RBDs9. Class 2 comprised four hNAbs whose epitopes bridged RBDs, including a VH3-53 hNAb that used a long CDRH3 with a hydrophobic tip to bridge between adjacent ""down"" RBDs, thereby locking the spike into a closed conformation. Epitope/paratope mapping revealed few interactions with host-derived N-glycans and minor contributions of antibody somatic hypermutations to epitope contacts. Affinity measurements and mapping of naturally-occurring and in vitro-selected spike mutants in 3D provided insight into the potential for SARS-CoV-2 escape from antibodies elicited during infection or delivered therapeutically.

Subsequent fractionation by continuous flow acid-urea (AU)-PAGE and antiviral testing revealed that cationic polypeptides within SP were responsible for the majority of anti-HIV-1 activity.

One peptide fragment of semenogelin I, termed SG-1, was purified from SP by a multistep chromatographic approach, protein sequenced, and determined to exhibit anti-HIV-1 activity against HIV-1. Anti-HIV-1 activity was transient, as whole SP incubated for prolonged time intervals exhibited a proportional decrease in anti-HIV-1 activity that was directly attributed to the degradation of semenogelin I peptides.

Previously we have shown that CAP generated with a flexible surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge (sDBD) is highly effective against bacteria in vitro and in ex vivo burn wound models. In the current paper, we determined the in vitro and in vivo safety and efficacy of CAP generated by this sDBD device. METHODS The effect of CAP on DNA mutations of V79 fibroblasts was measured using a hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) assay. Furthermore, effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis and DNA damage in ex vivo burn wound models (BWMs) were assessed using immunohistochemistry. Next, 105 colony forming units (CFU) P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 were exposed to CAP in a 3D collagen-elastin matrix environment to determine the number of surviving bacteria in vitro. Finally, rat excision wounds were inoculated with 107 CFU PAO1 for 24 h. The wounds received a single CAP treatment, repeated treatments on 4 consecutive days with CAP, 100 µL of 1% (wt/wt) silver sulfadiazine or no treatment. Wound swabs and punch biopsies were taken to determine the number of surviving bacteria. RESULTS Exposure of V79 fibroblasts to CAP did not increase the numbers of mutated colonies. Additionally, the number of proliferative, apoptotic and DNA damaged cells in the BWMs was comparable to that of the unexposed control. Exposure of PAO1 to CAP for 2 min resulted in the complete elimination of bacteria in vitro. Contrarily, CAP treatment for 6 min of rat wounds colonized with PAO1 did not effectively reduce the in vivo bacterial count.

Although existing guidelines had greatly promoted the recognition and management of CRS, many recommendations are not fully applicable to B-NHL. Therefore, it is imperative to identify responses that are specific to CRS observed following CAR T treatment for B-NHL. Based on underlying biological processes and known pathophysiological mechanisms, we tentatively propose a new model to illustrate the occurrence and evolution of CAR T-cell-therapy-related CRS in B-NHL. In this model, tumour burden and bone marrow suppression are considered determinants of CRS. Novel phenomena after CAR T-cell infusion (such as local inflammatory response) are further identified.

Each population of RNA virus is composed of a collection of different, yet related genomes often referred to as mutant spectra or quasispecies. Virologists using deep sequencing technologies face major obstacles when studying virus population dynamics, both experimentally and in natural settings due to the relatively high error rates of these technologies and the lack of high performance pipelines. In order to overcome these hurdles we developed a computational pipeline, termed ViVan (Viral Variance Analysis). ViVan is a complete pipeline facilitating the identification, characterization and comparison of sequence variance in deep sequenced virus populations. Results: Applying ViVan on deep sequenced data obtained from samples that were previously characterized by more classical approaches, we uncovered novel and potentially crucial aspects of virus populations. With our experimental work, we illustrate how ViVan can be used for studies ranging from the more practical, detection of resistant mutations and effects of antiviral treatments, to the more theoretical temporal characterization of the population in evolutionary studies.

One case-control study has reported an association between susceptibility to SARS and mannan-binding lectin (MBL) in China. As the downstream protein of MBL, variants of the MBL-associated serine protease-2 (MASP2) gene may be associated with SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection in the same population. METHODS: Thirty individuals with SARS were chosen for analysis of MASP2 polymorphisms by means of PCR direct sequencing. Tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tagSNPs) were chosen using pairwise tagging algorithms. The frequencies of four tag SNPs (rs12711521, rs2261695, rs2273346 and rs7548659) were ascertained in 376 SARS patients and 523 control subjects, using the Beckman SNPstream Ultra High Throughput genotyping platform. RESULTS: There is no significant association between alleles or genotypes of the MASP2 tagSNP and susceptibility to SARS-CoV in both Beijing and Guangzhou populations. Diplotype (rs2273346 and rs12711521)were analyzed for association with susceptibility to SARS, no statistically significant evidence of association was observed. The Beijing and Guangzhou sample groups were homogeneous regarding demographic and genetic parameters, a joined analysis also showed no statistically significant evidence of association.

METHODS We performed a double-blind trial randomizing osteoarthritic knee patients undergoing unilateral TKA done by either using scalpel (group S) or cautery (group C). Primary outcomes were total blood loss calculated from maximum haemoglobin drop and blood loss collected in drain. Secondary outcomes were systemic inflammatory response (serum C-reactive protein), wound complications, and functional outcomes assessed over three months. RESULTS A total of 80 patients were recruited. Group S had similar calculated total blood loss compared to group C (1070 (S) vs 1128 (C) mL, 95% CI - 219 to 103, p = 0.47). There was no difference in the mean drain-collected blood loss between the two groups (443 (S) vs 486 (C) mL, 95% CI - 128 to 47, p = 0.36). Group C had higher serum C-reactive protein level at 48 hours after TKA compare to group S (105 vs 140 mg/dL, 95% CI - 66 to - 4, p = 0.03). Wound complications and functional outcomes at three months were also similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Using electric cautery does not reduce total blood loss as we thought it would be in primary TKA compare to scalpel only surgery and it is also associated with a greater systemic inflammatory response.

This study explores the efficacy of socio-spatiality and its linkages with socio-physical liveability, taking Mumbai slum rehabs as case study. A comparative analysis of the current built-environment indicators and liveability status of major informal archetypes was performed, followed by analyses of the socio-physical problems associated with it. A critical evaluation of the rehabilitation housing of Mumbai highlights the problems caused by the current dense built-environment design. Reflecting on global instances, this article demonstrates the significance of socio-spatiality and suggests environmentally sustainable indicator-based built-environment recommendations, which if implemented in the forthcoming slum rehab housing planning, would enhance well-being and liveability among the low-income sector in future.

In response to the rapid global dissemination of the virus, on the 11th of Mars, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak a pandemic. Considering this situation, this paper intends to analyze and improve the current SEIR models to better represent the behavior of the COVID-19 and accurately predict the outcome of the pandemic in each social, economic, and political scenario. METHODOLOGY: We present a generalized Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental model and test it using a global optimization algorithm with data collected from the WHO. RESULTS: The main results were: (a) Our model was able to accurately fit the either deaths or active cases data of all tested countries using optimized coefficient values in agreement with recent reports; (b) when trying to fit both sets of data at the same time, fit was good for most countries, but not all. (c) Using our model, large ranges for each input, and optimization we predict death values for 15, 30, 45, and 60 days ahead with errors in the order of 5, 10, 20, and 80%, respectively; (d) sudden changes in the number of active cases cannot be predicted by the model unless data from outside sources are used. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the presented model may be used to predict 15 days ahead values of total deaths with errors in the order of 5%.

Methods: This study was a retrospective study. A total of 7 patients with heart failure and 12 patients with COVID-19 in the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between December 1, 2019 and February 15, 2020 were enrolled. The baseline clinical and imaging features of the two groups were statistically analyzed. Results: There was no significant difference in age and sex between the two groups(both P>0.05), but the incidence of epidemiological contact history, fever or respiratory symptoms in the COVID-19 group was significantly higher than that in the heart failure group (12/12 vs. 0, P<0.001; 12/12 vs. 4/7, P=0.013).

In-host genetic diversity could better position the virus population to respond and adapt to a diverse array of selective pressures such as host-switching events. Multiple new coronaviruses, including SARS, have been identified in human samples just within the last ten years, demonstrating the potential of coronaviruses as emergent human pathogens. Deep sequencing was used to characterize genomic changes in coronavirus quasispecies during simulated host-switching. Three bovine nasal samples infected with bovine coronavirus were used to infect human and bovine macrophage and lung cell lines. The virus reproduced relatively well in macrophages, but the lung cell lines were not infected efficiently enough to allow passage of non lab-adapted samples. Approximately 12 kb of the genome was amplified before and after passage and sequenced at average coverages of nearly 950×(454 sequencing) and 38,000×(Illumina). The consensus sequence of many of the passaged samples had a 12 nucleotide insert in the consensus sequence of the spike gene, and multiple point mutations were associated with the presence of the insert. Deep sequencing revealed that the insert was present but very rare in the unpassaged samples and could quickly shift to dominate the population when placed in a different environment. The insert coded for three arginine residues, occurred in a region associated with fusion entry into host cells, and may allow infection of new cell types via heparin sulfate binding. Analysis of the deep sequencing data indicated that two distinct genotypes circulated at different frequency levels in each sample, and support the hypothesis that the mutations present in passaged strains were “selected” from a pre-existing pool rather than through de novo mutation and subsequent population fixation.",2013-01-07,"Borucki, Monica K.; Allen, Jonathan E.; Chen-Harris, Haiyin; Zemla, Adam; Vanier, Gilda; Mabery, Shalini; Torres, Clinton; Hullinger, Pamela; Slezak, Tom",PLoS One,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/7139441855f3ac67f104fb9e067b1359c5582fd6.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3538757.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0052752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23308119/,7158569.0

It is important to understand the presentation, temporal sequence, risk factors, and outcomes to undertake measures for prevention and treatment. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, interventional study on six consecutive patients with COVID-19 who developed rhino-orbital mucormycosis and were managed at two tertiary ophthalmic referral centers in India between August 1 and December 15, 2020. Diagnosis of mucormycosis was based on clinical features, culture, and histopathology from sinus biopsy. Patients were treated with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B with addition of posaconazole and surgical debridement of necrotic tissue. Results: All patients were male, mean age 60.5 ± 12 (46.2-73.9) years, type 2 diabetics with mean blood glucose level of 222.5 ± 144.4 (86-404) mg/dL. Except for one patient who was diagnosed with mucormycosis concurrently with COVID-19, all patients received systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19. The mean duration between diagnosis of COVID-19 and development of symptoms of mucor was 15.6 ± 9.6 (3-42) days. All patients underwent endoscopic sinus debridement, whereas two patients required orbital exenteration. At the last follow-up, all six patients were alive, on antifungal therapy. Conclusion: Mucormycosis is a life-threatening, opportunistic infection, and patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 are more susceptible to it.

To cope with this shortage, the government introduced a severity scoring system for patients with COVID-19 and designed a new type of quarantine facility for treating and isolating patients with mild symptoms out of the hospital, namely, the Residential Treatment Center (RTC). A patient with mild symptoms was immediately isolated in the RTC and continuously monitored to detect changes in symptoms. If the symptoms aggravate, the patient was transferred to a hospital. RTCs were designed by creating a quarantine environment in existing lodging facilities capable of accommodating > 100 individuals. The facilities were entirely divided into a clean zone (working area) and contaminated zone (patient zone), separating the space, air, and movement routes, and the staff wore level D personal protective equipment (PPE) in the contaminated zone. The staffs consisted of medical personnel, police officers, soldiers, and operation personnel, and worked in two or three shifts per day.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The relationship between rate per 1000 individuals of publicly reported COVID-19 cases at the tribal reservation and/or community level and average household characteristics from the 2018 5-Year American Community Survey records. RESULTS: By April 10, 2020, in regression analysis, COVID-19 cases were more likely by the proportion of homes lacking indoor plumbing (10.83, P = .001) and were less likely according to the percentage of reservation households that were English-only (−2.43, P = .03). Household overcrowding measures were not statistically significant in this analysis (−6.40, P = .326).

We sought to estimate and compare the COVID-19 CFR in Canada and the United States while adjusting for 2 potential biases in crude CFR. METHODS: We used the daily incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Canada and the US from Jan. 31 to Apr. 22, 2020. We applied a statistical method to minimize bias in the crude CFR by accounting for the survival interval as the lag time between disease onset and death, while considering reporting rates of COVID-19 cases less than 50% (95% confidence interval 10%-50%). RESULTS: Using data for confirmed cases in Canada, we estimated the crude CFR to be 4.9% on Apr. 22, 2020, and the adjusted CFR to be 5.5% (credible interval [CrI] 4.9%-6.4%). After we accounted for various reporting rates less than 50%, the adjusted CFR was estimated at 1.6% (CrI 0.7%-3.1%). The US crude CFR was estimated to be 5.4% on Apr. 20, 2020, with an adjusted CFR of 6.1% (CrI 5.4%-6.9%). With reporting rates of less than 50%, the adjusted CFR for the US was 1.78 (CrI 0.8%-3.6%). INTERPRETATION: Our estimates suggest that, if the reporting rate is less than 50%, the adjusted CFR of COVID-19 in Canada is likely to be less than 2%.

It was determined that a new type of beta coronavirus called severe acute respiratory disease coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was causative agent of this outbreak and the disease caused by the virus was named as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID19). Despite the information obtained from the viral genome structure, many aspects of the virus-host interactions during infection is still unknown. In this study we aimed to identify SARS-CoV-2 encoded microRNAs and their cellular targets. We applied a computational method to predict miRNAs encoded by SARS-CoV-2 along with their putative targets in humans. Targets of predicted miRNAs were clustered into groups based on their biological processes, molecular function, and cellular compartments using GO and PANTHER. By using KEGG pathway enrichment analysis top pathways were identified. Finally, we have constructed an integrative pathway network analysis with target genes. We identified 40 SARS-CoV-2 miRNAs and their regulated targets. Our analysis showed that targeted genes including NFKB1, NFKBIE, JAK1–2, STAT3–4, STAT5B, STAT6, SOCS1–6, IL2, IL8, IL10, IL17, TGFBR1–2, SMAD2–4, HDAC1–6 and JARID1A-C, JARID2 play important roles in NFKB, JAK/STAT and TGFB signaling pathways as well as cells' epigenetic regulation pathways.

At present, the law of COVID-19 spread in cities is not clear. Cities have long been difficult areas for epidemic prevention and control because of the high population density, high mobility of people, and high frequency of contacts. This paper analyzed case information for 417 patients with COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China. The nearest neighbor index method, kernel density method, and the standard deviation ellipse method were used to analyze the spatio-temporal characteristics of the COVID-19 spread in Shenzhen. The factors influencing that spread were then explored using the multiple linear regression method. The results show that: (1) The development of COVID-19 epidemic situation in Shenzhen occurred in three stages. The patients showed significant hysteresis from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization and then to diagnosis. Prior to 27 January, there was a relatively long time interval between the onset of symptoms and hospitalization for COVID-19; the interval decreased thereafter. (2) The epidemic site (the place where the patient stays during the onset of the disease) showed an agglomeration in space. The degree of agglomeration constantly increased across the three time nodes of 31 January, 14 February, and 22 February. The epidemic sites formed a “core area” in terms of spatial distribution and spread along the “northwest–southeast” direction of the city.

More than 90% of people with mental illness do not get any treatment and tens of thousands of people with psychosis are illegally detained ('pasung') in the family home. Civic engagement, a core part of the recent World Health Organisation global strategy, has the potential to address some of these challenges through the development of person-centered models of care. The aim of the study is to develop a testable systems level, culturally appropriate, civic engagement framework for use in Jakarta and Bogor, Indonesia to strengthen local mental health services. Methods A mixed methods study underpinned by a realist approach will be undertaken across four phases in two study sites in Indonesia (Jakarta and Bogor). Phase 1 will explore the use of civic engagement across South East Asia by conducting a systematic review of existing evidence. By surveying 300 mental health professionals, phase 2 will identify the stakeholders, the sources of collaboration and the evidence used by professionals in decision making within local mental health systems and identify potential opportunities for civic engagement within the system. In order to explore the potential use of civic engagement within Indonesian mental health services and identify priorities for a culturally appropriate framework, phase 3 will undertake two focus groups with participants with experience of psychosis or caring for someone with psychosis (n = 20-30). Professionals and other key decision makers in a range of roles across the system at a national (n = 5) and local level (n = 10-15/site) will also take part in semi-structured interviews. Phase 4 will co-produce a civic engagement framework for use in Indonesia by synthesising evidence from phases 1-3 collaboratively with key stakeholders. Discussion Civic engagement is a potential way in which health services in low and middle income countries can address the burden of mental health conditions through the development of person-centred models of care. However, such approaches are underexplored in Indonesia.

The aim of our study was to report on the prevalence of liver injury in our cohort, to evaluate the association of mild versus severe liver injury with mortality in COVID-19 patients and to scrutinize the temporal pattern of viral detection and liver injury. METHODS: We present data from a German cohort of 147 SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. The patients were divided into 3 groups according to their liver status during treatment. The first group included patients without elevated alanine aminotransferase or bilirubin, the third group patients meeting the biochemical criteria of acute liver failure (ALF), and the second group all other patients. RESULTS: Liver injury was detected in 75 (50.7%) and 93 (63%) patients by admission and during treatment, respectively. ALF was associated with the male sex, younger age, and higher BMI. Mortality was associated with the presence of ALF (OR = 9.423, 95% CI: 2.410–36.858) in contrast to milder liver injury (OR 1.101, 95% CI: 0.435–2.791). In 30% of patients with mild liver injury and in 50% of ALF patients, peak liver injury was observed at a time point when the virus was no longer detectable in the respiratory tract.

Serious games provide an underutilized tool to promote learning and innovation around global health crises. In order to explore the potential of Serious Games as a policy learning tool, Global Affairs Canada, in collaboration with the Department of National Defense and academic partners, developed and implemented a matrix game aimed at prompting critical reflection and gender-based analysis on infectious disease outbreak preparedness and response. This commentary, written by the core development team, reflects on the process and outcomes of the gaming exercise, which we believe will be of interest to others hoping to promote innovative thinking and learning around global health policy and crisis response, as well as the application of serious games more broadly. MAIN BODY: Participants reported, through discussions and a post-game survey, that they felt the game was reflective of real-world decision-making and priority-setting challenges during a crisis. They reflected on the challenges that emerge around global health co-operation and outbreak preparedness, particularly noting the importance of learning to work with private actors. While participants only sporadically applied gender-based analysis or considered the social determinants of health during the game, post-game discussions led to reflection on the ways in which equity concerns are put aside during a crisis scenario and on why this happens, offering critical learning opportunities. CONCLUSION: Matrix games provide opportunities for policy-makers and health professionals to experience the challenges of global health co-operation, test ideas and explore how biases, such as those around gender, influence policy-making and implementation. Due to their flexibility, adaptability and accessibility, serious games offer a potentially powerful learning tool for global health policy-makers and practitioners.",2020-03-10,"Smith, Julia; Sears, Nathan; Taylor, Ben; Johnson, Madeline",Global Health,nan,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7063729.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32151263/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00547-6,212642122.0

RECENT FINDINGS Eight articles have been published which met the inclusion criteria. This included six articles about the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence for assessment purposes and two articles about the possibility of teaching applications, including one review and one original research article. All the research articles pointed out the importance of machine learning and artificial intelligence for the stratification of trainees, based on their performance on basic tasks or procedures simulated in a virtual reality environment. SUMMARY Machine learning and artificial intelligence are designed to analyse data and use them to take decisions that typically require human intelligence. Evidence in literature is still scarce about this technology applied to virtual reality and existing manuscripts are mainly focused on its potential to stratify surgical performance and provide synthetic feedbacks about it.

Study Objective The main objective of this study was to assess the real number of available and readily freeable beds (""bed surge capacity"") and the availability of emergency operating rooms (OR) in a maximum emergency using a theoretical simulation. Patients and Methods The proportion of dismissible patients in four areas (Medical Area, Surgical Area, Sub-intensive Care Units, Intensive Care Units) and three emergency OR was assessed at 2 and 24 hours after a simulated maximum emergency. Four scenarios were modeled. Hospitalization and surgical capacities were assessed on weekdays and holidays. The creation of new beds was presumed by the possibility of moving patients to a lower level of care than that provided at the time of detection, of dislocation of patients to a discharge room, with care transferred to lower-intensity hospitals, rehabilitation, or discharge facilities. The Phase 1 table-top simulations were conducted during the weekday morning hours. In particular, the 24-hour table-top simulations of a hypothetical event lasted about 150 minutes compared to those conducted at 2 hours, which were found to be longer (about 195 minutes). Phase 2 was conducted on two public holidays and a quick response time was observed within the first 40 minutes of the start of the test (about 45% of departments). Results The availability of simulated beds was greater than that indicated in the maximum emergency plans (which was based solely on the census of beds). Patients admitted to Intensive Care and The Sub-Intensive Area may be more difficult to move than those in low-intensity care. The availability of emergency OR was not problematic.

The highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and rapidly spread across the entire globe. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)has infected more than two million people worldwide, causing over 160,000 deaths. Patients with COVID-19 disease present with a wide array of symptoms, ranging from mild flu-like complaints to life threatening pulmonary and cardiac complications. Older people and patients with underlying disease have an increased risk of developing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) requiring mechanical ventilation. Once intubated, mortality increases exponentially. A number of pharmacologic regimens, including hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin, antiviral therapy (eg, remdesevir), and anti-IL-6 agents (e.g., toclizumab), have been highlighted by investigators over the course of the pandemic, based on the therapy's potential to interrupt the viral life-cycle of SARS-CoV-2 or preventing cytokine storm. At present, there have been no conclusive series of reproducible randomised clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of any one drug or therapy for COVID-19. CASES COVID-19 positive patients (n=5) at a single institution received hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) between 13 and 20 April 2020. All the patients had tachypnoea and low oxygen saturation despite receiving high FiO2. HBOT was added to prevent the need for mechanical ventilation. A standard dive profile of 2.0ATA for 90 minutes was employed. Patients received between one and six treatments in one of two dedicated monoplace hyperbaric chambers. RESULTS All the patients recovered without the need for mechanical ventilation. Following HBOT, oxygen saturation increased, tachypnoea resolved and inflammatory markers fell. At the time of writing, three of the five patients have been discharged from the hospital and two remain in stable condition. CONCLUSION This small sample of patients exhibited dramatic improvement with HBOT. Most importantly, HBOT potentially prevented the need for mechanical ventilation.

ubxq92xr,nan,Medline,BCG vaccination history associates with decreased SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence across a diverse cohort of healthcare workers.,10.1172/jci145157,nan,33211672,unk,"BACKGROUND Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused over one million deaths worldwide, thus there is an urgent need to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies. The anti-tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) demonstrates non-specific protective innate immune-boosting effects. Here, we determined if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion in a retrospective observational study of a diverse cohort of health care workers (HCWs). METHODS We assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and collected medical questionnaires, including BCG vaccination status and pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics, from an observational cohort of HCWs in a multi-site Los Angeles healthcare organization. We used multi-variate analysis to estimate if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion. RESULTS Of the 6,201 HCWs, 29.6% reported a history of BCG vaccination whereas 68.9% did not receive BCG vaccination. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG as well as incidence of self-reported clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 were significantly decreased among HCWs with a history of BCG vaccination compared to those without BCG vaccination. After adjusting for age and sex, we found that history of BCG vaccination, but not meningococcal, pneumococcal or influenza vaccination, was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion. CONCLUSIONS History of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and reduced reported COVID-19-related clinical symptoms in this cohort of HCWs.

A systematic review protocol.,10.1136/bmjopen-2017-017533,nan,29440153,cc-by-nc,"INTRODUCTION The aim of this review is to answer the following question: Does assistive technology contribute to social inclusion for people with intellectual disability? Previous research on assistive technology has focused on socioeconomic impacts such as education, employment and access to healthcare by people with intellectual disability. There is a need to consolidate evidence on the interaction between intellectual disability, assistive technology, community living and social inclusion. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The review will consider studies from all settings: geographical, socioeconomic and care (institutional and community care), published in English. Studies reported in other languages with abstracts in English will be included if they can be translated using Google Translate, otherwise such studies will be included in the appendix. The review will include both qualitative and quantitative studies. The intervention in this review refers to the use of assistive technology to promote community participation or interpersonal relationships (social inclusion) for people with intellectual disability. The outcomes will be behavioural and social benefits of using assistive technology by people with intellectual disability. Enhanced interpersonal relationships and community participation by people with intellectual disability. Data analysis will be in two phases. The first phase will involve analysis of individual study designs separately. The second phase will be narrative/thematic synthesis of all study groups. ETHICS The review will not create any ethical or safety concerns. DISSEMINATION At least one peer-reviewed article in a leading journal such as the BMJ is planned. The findings will also be disseminated through a seminar session involving internal audience at Trinity College Dublin and within the Assistive Technologies for people with Intellectual Disability and Autism research programme.

CASE REPORT: A 57-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital (Ospedale Degli Infermi, Biella, Italy) presenting with symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction from a nasopharyngeal swab, authorized and validated by the World Health Organization, confirmed the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient presented with severe respiratory distress and underwent orotracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation. She was extubated after 9 days in the intensive care unit. After extubation, the patient experienced an onset of dysphonia, and was evaluated by the otolaryngologist. The videolaryngoscopy revealed the presence of an ulceration at the level of the left vocal cord. Steroids and proton pump inhibitors were administered as primary therapy for 1 week. Two weeks later, a significant improvement in the patient’s voice quality was observed. A second videolaryngoscopy was performed, which displayed healing of the ulcer at the level of the left vocal fold and rapid re-epithelialization. CONCLUSIONS: This report has shown that with increasing numbers of cases of severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, clinical guidelines should be followed to ensure that the incidence of complications such as vocal cord ulceration are as low as possible.",2020-11-04,"Bertonz, Fabio; Robiolio, Emanuele; Gervasio, Carmine Fernando",Am J Case Rep,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/4afb0b71b28643840e850cfab0a258d1b399e4a7.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7649743.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.12659/ajcr.928126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33147206/,226260135.0

METHODS: Investigators evaluated ill travelers returning from a mass gathering, and presenting to a GeoSentinel site between August 2015 and April 2019, and collected data on the nature of the event and the relation between final diagnoses and the mass gathering. RESULTS: Of 296 ill travelers, 51% were female and the median age was 54 years (range: 1–88). Over 82% returned from a religious mass gathering, most frequently Umrah or Hajj. Only 3% returned from the Olympics in Brazil or South Korea. Other mass gatherings included other sporting events, cultural or entertainment events, and conferences. Respiratory diseases accounted for almost 80% of all diagnoses, with vaccine preventable illnesses such as influenza and pneumonia accounting for 26% and 20% of all diagnoses respectively. This was followed by gastrointestinal illnesses, accounting for 4.5%. Sixty-three percent of travelers reported having a pre-travel encounter with a healthcare provider.

The complexity of the pathophysiologic response to direct or indirect lung injury in ARDS is difficult to reconstruct in experimental conditions. Thus, direct analysis of ARDS patient blood may provide valuable information. We investigated genome-wide gene expression profiles in paired whole blood samples from patients with ARDS (n = 8) during the acute stage (within 3 d of diagnosis) and recovery stage of ARDS (around ICU discharge). Among 126 differentially expressed genes, peptidase inhibitor 3 (PI3, encoding elafin, a potent neutrophil elastase inhibitor) had the largest fold-change (-3-fold changes, acute stage/recovery stage) in expression, indicating down-regulation during the acute stage of ARDS. We further examined plasma PI3 levels in 40 patients with ARDS and 23 at-risk control subjects from the same cohort. There was a coincidence of the microarray findings of lower PI3 gene expression with the lower plasma PI3 during the acute-stage. The plasma PI3 levels were statistically significant different among pre-diagnosis, day of diagnosis, and post-diagnosis groups (ANOVA, P = 0.001), with a trend of decreasing from pre- to post-diagnosis group. The time course of plasma PI3 decrease is well correlated with the course of early ARDS development (Pearson correlation coefficient: -0.52, P = 0.0006). Considering that PI3 can covalently binding to extracellular matrix in lung, circulating PI3 may provide a useful clinical marker for monitoring the early development of ARDS and may have implications for ARDS treatment.",2008,"Wang, Zhaoxi; Beach, Douglas; Su, Li; Zhai, Rihong; Christiani, David C",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1165/rcmb.2007-0354oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18203972/,12892144.0

We investigated the association between use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) and COVID-19 hospitalization/death in a large nationwide population. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with hypertension, heart failure, diabetes, kidney disease, or ischaemic heart disease registered in the Swedish National Patient Registry until 1 February 2020 were included and followed until 31 May 2020. COVID-19 cases were defined based on hospitalization/death for COVID-19. Multivariable logistic and Cox regressions were fitted to investigate the association between ACEi/ARB and MRA and risk of hospitalization/death for COVID-19 in the overall population, and of all-cause mortality in COVID-19 cases. We performed consistency analysis to quantify the impact of potential unmeasured confounding. Of 1 387 746 patients (60% receiving ACEi/ARB and 5.8% MRA), 7146 (0.51%) had incident hospitalization/death from COVID-19. After adjustment for 45 variables, ACEi/ARB use was associated with a reduced risk of hospitalization/death for COVID-19 (odds ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.81-0.91) in the overall population, and with reduced mortality in COVID-19 cases (hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.82-0.96). MRA use was not associated with risk of any outcome. Consistency analysis showed that unmeasured confounding would need to be large for there to be harmful signals associated with RAASi use.

A total of 31 cases were reported by April 10, and it increased to 95 by May 15. Thereafter, with the rapid increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in the general population since late March, there was a not surprising increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in dialysis patients. The mortality rate is 16.2% (16/99 cases) in dialysis patients, which is higher than 5.3% (874/16532 cases) in the general population. This higher mortality rate in dialysis patients with COVID-19 might be related to their age; the majority of COVID-19 cases are aged between 70 and 90 years in dialysis patients, compared with between 20 and 60 years in the general population. As COVID-19 presents with severe symptoms and is associated with a high mortality rate in dialysis patients, dialysis patients who have contracted SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing are required to be hospitalized under Japanese government policy. In cases of COVID-19 hospitalizations, it is essential to prevent nosocomial infection. Therefore, patients must be sufficiently instructed in infection prevention and robust measures to prevent contraction and spread of the infection must be taken at dialysis facilities.

The newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly contagious, and an urgent race is on to develop a new vaccine against this virus in a timeframe never attempted before. The use of the human viral challenge model has been proposed to accelerate the development of the vaccine. In the early 2000s, the authors successfully developed a pathogenic human viral challenge model for another virus for which there was no effective treatment and established it to evaluate potential therapies and vaccines against respiratory syncytial virus. Experience gained in the development of that model can help with the development of a COVID-19 HVCM and the authors describe it here.",2020,"Lambkin-Williams, Rob; DeVincenzo, John P",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,nan,#713679,nan,nan,nan,nan,221124472.0

Rehabilitation is increasingly recognised as contributing to dementia care. Rehabilitation subscribes to person-centredness, and thus, evaluations of person-centredness in rehabilitation for people living with dementia are relevant in order for healthcare professionals to know how best to practice person-centredness. Aim The aim of this study was to identify methods of evaluating person-centeredness in rehabilitation for people living with dementia. Materials and Methods Review of the literature using the search terms dementia, person-centredness, and rehabilitation or occupational therapy. Databases searched included: CINAHL, PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, OTseeker, and SveMed+. The study included peer-reviewed articles from year 2000 to 2018 in Danish, English, Norwegian, or Swedish. Results Only one academic article met the inclusion criteria. In that article, person-centred practice was evaluated using observation and interview as well as analytical frameworks from person-centred care and occupational therapy. Conclusion Evaluations of person-centred practice in rehabilitation for people living with dementia in peer-reviewed literature are lacking. Evaluations are needed to identify effective strategies to pursue and uphold person-centred care. Given the dearth of research on evaluations of person-centredness in rehabilitation, this article included research in person-centred dementia care in the discussion, which potentially can inspire practice and research of rehabilitation for people living with dementia. To understand the complex nature of person-centredness, a variety of research methodologies of qualitative and quantitative characters are recommended for evaluations.",2019,"Allen Christensen, Kate; Lund, Karen-Margrethe; Thuesen, Jette",Journal of aging research,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/8510792; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31192013/,155545893.0

In this study, we established a SCoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (SP), including a SP mutant D614G, pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector system and tested their ability to infect ACE2-expressing cells. This study revealed that a C-terminal 17 amino acid deletion in SCoV-2 SP significantly increases the incorporation of SP into the pseudotyped viruses and enhanced its infectivity, which may be helpful in the design of SCoV2-SP-based vaccine strategies. Moreover, based on this system, we have demonstrated that an aqueous extract from the Chinese herb Prunella vulgaris (CHPV) and a compound, suramin, displayed potent inhibitory effects on both wild type and mutant (G614) SCoV-2 SP pseudotyped virus (SCoV-2-SP-PVs)-mediated infection. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for CHPV and suramin on SCoV-2-SP-PVs are 30, and 40 μg/ml, respectively. To define the mechanisms of their actions, we demonstrated that both CHPV and suramin are able to directly interrupt SCoV-2–SP binding to its receptor ACE2 and block the viral entry step. Importantly, our results also showed that CHPV or suramin can efficiently reduce levels of cytopathic effect caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus (hCoV-19/Canada/ON-VIDO-01/2020) infection in Vero cells. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that the combination of CHPV/suramin with an anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody mediated more potent blocking effect against SCoV2-SP-PVs.

Seven (7) distinct yeasts were isolated and identified using cultural, microscopy and biochemical tests (temperature tolerance, flocculation, ethanol tolerance, H2S production and killer toxin production and the ability to assimilate and ferment sugars. The yeast isolates were screened using refractometric and spectrophotometric methods to select the isolate with the best ability for wine production. This isolate was molecularly characterized, grown in 1 L of potatoes dextrose broth, freeze dried and used for wine production. The population of yeast, bacteria and the physicochemical analysis of the must were monitored during fermentation. Populations of bacteria in the wine were assessed by standard pour plate count. The proximate content and physicochemical properties of the produced wine before and after ageing, as well as the sensorial quality of the produced wine was determined. All the yeast isolates possessed the ability to flocculate, tolerate ethanol concentration of between 5 and 20% and temperature range of 30-45 °C, produced low concentration of H2S and does not produce killer toxins. A palm wine isolate, identified as Saccharomyces cerevisiae X01 was selected as the best isolate with the most ability for wine production. The total yeast count increases as the period of fermentation progressed while the total viable bacterial count reduced as the fermentation period progressed. There was a significant difference (P < 0.05) in the physicochemical properties of the must during fermentation. At the end of the fermentation, the produced wine had 5.22% and 4.86% ethanol content for S. cerevisiae QA23 and S. cerevisiae X01 respectively.

As COVID‐19 preparedness and response plans were rapidly instituted across sub‐Saharan Africa, many governments and donor organizations braced themselves for the unknown impact the COVID‐19 pandemic would have in under‐resourced settings with high burdens of PLHIV. The potential negative impact of COVID‐19 in these countries is uncertain, but is estimated to contribute both directly and indirectly to the morbidity and mortality of PLHIV, requiring countries to leverage existing HIV care systems to propel COVID‐19 responses, while protecting PLHIV and HIV program gains. In anticipation of COVID‐19‐related disruptions, PEPFAR promptly established guidance to rapidly adapt HIV programs to maintain essential HIV services while protecting recipients of care and staff from COVID‐19. This commentary reviews PEPFAR’s COVID‐19 technical guidance and provides country‐specific examples of program adaptions in sub‐Sahran Africa. DISCUSSION: The COVID‐19 pandemic may pose significant risks to the continuity of HIV services, especially in countries with high HIV prevalence and weak and over‐burdened health systems. Although there is currently limited understanding of how COVID‐19 affects PLHIV, it is imperative that public health systems and academic centers monitor the impact of COVID‐19 on PLHIV. The general principles of the HIV program adaptation guidance from PEPFAR prioritize protecting the gains in the HIV response while minimizing in‐person home and facility visits and other direct contact when COVID‐19 control measures are in effect. PEPFAR‐supported clinical, laboratory, supply chain, community and data reporting systems can play an important role in mitigating the impact of COVID‐19 in sub‐Saharan Africa. CONCLUSIONS: As community transmission of COVID‐19 continues and the number of country cases rise, fragile health systems may be strained. Utilizing the adaptive, data‐driven program approaches in facilities and communities established and supported by PEPFAR provides the opportunity to strengthen the COVID‐19 response while protecting the immense gains spanning HIV prevention, testing and treatment reached thus far.",2020-07-12,"Golin, Rachel; Godfrey, Catherine; Firth, Jacqueline; Lee, Lana; Minior, Thomas; Phelps, B.

The immune system uses it both as an effector mechanism to clear intracellular pathogens and as a mechanism to monitor its products for evidence of pathogen invasion and cellular transformation. Because autophagy delivers intracellular material for lysosomal degradation, its products are primarily loaded onto MHC class II molecules and are able to stimulate CD4+ T cells. This process might shape the self-tolerance of the CD4+ T cell repertoire and stimulate CD4+ T cell responses against pathogens and tumors. Beyond antigen processing, autophagy's role in cell survival is to assist the clonal expansion of B and T cells for efficient adaptive immune responses.

Alimentary glucose absorption and intestinal disposal of blood glucose have not been directly compared between individuals or animals that underwent RYGB vs VSG. We evaluated in rats and humans how the gut epithelium adapts after surgery and the consequences on alimentary glucose absorption and intestinal disposal of blood glucose. METHODS Obese male rats underwent RYGB, VSG, or sham (control) operations. We collected intestine segments from all rats; we performed histologic analyses and measured levels of messenger RNAs encoding the sugar transporters SGLT1, GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, GLUT4, and GLUT5. Glucose transport and consumption were assayed using ex vivo jejunal loops. Histologic analyses were also performed on Roux limb sections from patients who underwent RYGB 1-5 years after surgery. Roux limb glucose consumption was assayed after surgery by positron emission and computed tomography imaging. RESULTS In rats and humans that underwent RYGB, the Roux limb became hyperplasic, with an increased number of incretin-producing cells compared with the corresponding jejunal segment of controls. Furthermore, expression of sugar transporters and hypoxia-related genes increased and the nonintestinal glucose transporter GLUT1 appeared at the basolateral membrane of enterocytes. Ingested and circulating glucose was trapped within the intestinal epithelial cells of rats and humans that underwent RYGB. By contrast, there was no hyperplasia of the intestine after VSG, but the intestinal absorption of alimentary glucose was reduced and density of endocrine cells secreting glucagon-like peptide-1 increased.

So far, nothing is known about the course of psychological disturbances, such as fear, anxiety, and sleep disturbances of this pandemic over time in Europe. METHODS: Aim of this web-based survey was to assess the mental health burden of the German public over a period of 50 days after the COVID-19 outbreak. 16,245 individuals responded regarding sleep disturbances, COVID-19-fear, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7). Data were put in relation to infection rates, number of deaths and the German stock index. RESULTS: The specific fear increased rapidly in concordance with infection numbers. However, no relation to the number of deaths was found, COVID-19-fear developed reversed to the stock index. Initially, 13.5% of the respondents reported a reduced sleep quality, and 7.2% a moderate generalized anxiety; proceeding simultaneously with high peaks.

The etiology of PD is still not clear but systemic inflammation is proved to trigger and exacerbate DA neurons degeneration. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) and plays a major role in promoting the host immune. TLR4-mediated signal pathways induce the release of many inflammatory cytokines. It is reasonable to hypothesize that TLR4 is the mediator in microglia contributing to the damage of DA neurons in the SNpc. In this study, we evaluated the role of TLR4 in the chronic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)/probenecid mouse model. Both TLR4-deficient and wild-type (WT) mice were injected with probenecid (250 mg/kg, i.p.) followed by injection of MPTP (25 mg/kg, s.c.) every 4 days for 10 times. From D43 to D47, the behavioral performance in pole test and wire hang test was assessed. Then the mice were euthanized, and SN and striatum were dissected out for biochemical tests. We showed that compared with MPTP-treated WT mice, TLR4 deficiency significantly attenuated MPTP-induced motor deficits and TH-protein expression reduction in SNpc and striatum, suppressed MPTP-induced α-synuclein abnormality and neuroinflammation mediated through oxidative stress, glial activation, NF-κB and the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling pathways.

We have previously shown that children with chronic suppurative lung disease have a reduced capacity to produce IFN-γ in response to NTHi compared with healthy control children. The aim of this study was to determine if deficient NTHi-specific IFN-γ production is associated with heightened systemic or airway inflammation. We measured a panel of cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 p70), antimicrobial proteins (LL-37, IP-10) as well as cellular and clinical factors associated with airway and systemic inflammation in 70 children with chronic suppurative lung disease. IFN-γ was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells challenged in vitro with live NTHi. Regression analysis was used to assess the association between the systemic and airway inflammation and the capacity to produce IFN-γ. On multivariate regression, NTHi-specific IFN-γ production was significantly negatively associated with the BAL concentrations of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 (β=-0.316; 95%CI -0.49, -0.14; p=0.001) and IL-1β (β=-0.023; 95%CI -0.04, -0.01; p=0.001). This association was independent of bacterial or viral infection, BAL cellularity and the severity of bronchiectasis (using modified Bhalla score on chest CT scans). We found limited evidence of systemic inflammation in children with chronic suppurative lung disease. In summary, increased local airway inflammation is associated with a poorer systemic cell-mediated immune response to NTHi in children with chronic suppurative lung disease.

Previous multi-omic data have implied that the pathogenesis of WB is associated with the activation of immune system and inflammatory response. However, the intricate mechanisms are not fully understood. This study was therefore conducted to systematically investigate the morphology, expression of cytokines as well as the underlying signaling pathways regulating the inflammatory response in pectoralis major (PM) muscle of WB myopathic broilers. RESULTS Histopathological changes, increased plasma creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase activities, elevated myeloperoxidase activity and overproduction of nitric oxide in muscle indicated the enhancement of muscle damage and inflammation in WB broilers. The mRNA expressions of inflammatory cytokines were dysregulated in PM muscle and contents of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α were increased in serum of WB myopathic broilers, indicating this myopathy was associated with immune disorder and systemic inflammation response. Additionally, toll-like receptors (TLRs) levels were upregulated, the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) signaling pathway was activated and the mRNA expression levels of downstream inflammatory mediators were enhanced in PM muscle of WB myopathy affected birds. CONCLUSION The results indicated an immune disorder and a systemic inflammation response in WB myopathic broilers, which might be related to a synergetic effect of TLRs and NF-κB pathway.

In this study, we examined the ability of influenza A virus to manipulate cell cycle progression. Our results show that influenza A virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1) replication results in G(0)/G(1)-phase accumulation of infected cells and that this accumulation is caused by the prevention of cell cycle entry from G(0)/G(1) phase into S phase. Consistent with the G(0)/G(1)-phase accumulation, the amount of hyperphosphorylated retinoblastoma protein, a necessary active form for cell cycle progression through late G(1) into S phase, decreased after infection with A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus. In addition, other key molecules in the regulation of the cell cycle, such as p21, cyclin E, and cyclin D1, were also changed and showed a pattern of G(0)/G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest. It is interesting that increased viral protein expression and progeny virus production in cells synchronized in the G(0)/G(1) phase were observed compared to those in either unsynchronized cells or cells synchronized in the G(2)/M phase. G(0)/G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest is likely a common strategy, since the effect was also observed in other strains, such as H3N2, H9N2, PR8 H1N1, and pandemic swine H1N1 viruses.

Background: Public reporting of PCI outcomes is a performance metric and a requirement in many healthcare systems. There are inconsistent data on the causes of death after PCI, and what proportion of these are attributable to cardiac causes. Methods: All patients undergoing PCI in England between 1st January 2017 and 10th May 2020 were retrospectively analysed (n=273,141), according to their outcome from the date of PCI; no death and in-hospital, post-discharge, and 30-day death. Results: The overall rates of in-hospital and 30-day death were 1.9% and 2.8%, respectively. The rate of 30-day death declined between 2017 (2.9%) and February 2020 (2.5%), mainly due to lower in-hospital death (2.1% vs. 1.5%), before rising again from 1st March 2020 (3.2%) due to higher rates of post-discharge mortality.

Fast screening and diagnosis are thus crucial for quick isolation and clinical intervention. In this work, we showed that attenuated total reflection–Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR–FT-IR) can be a primary diagnostic tool for COVID-19 as a supplement to in-use techniques. It requires only a small volume (∼3 μL) of the serum sample and a shorter detection time (several minutes).

The purpose of this article is to describe the clinical and angiographic results with an emphasis on visual outcomes following the endovascular treatment of ophthalmic segment ICA aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS The records of 1254 patients who presented for endovascular treatment of a cerebral aneurysm were retrospectively reviewed to identify 65 consecutive patients who underwent coil embolization of an ophthalmic segment ICA aneurysm. The clinical records, treatment reports, and imaging were reviewed with a focus on visual outcomes. RESULTS Twenty-two of the 65 patients (34%) who presented for treatment of an ophthalmic aneurysm reported a visual disturbance at presentation. Fifteen of the 22 patients (68%) experienced an improvement in their symptoms after treatment. Overall, patients with visual symptoms were significantly more likely to benefit from treatment than to have a decline in vision (P = .03). The overall morbidity was 4%, and mortality was 0%. The retreatment rate was high at 30%, though this was disproportionately weighted by an 86% retreatment rate in patients with ruptured aneurysms. CONCLUSIONS Patients with visual symptoms attributable to ophthalmic segment ICA aneurysms undergoing endovascular coil embolization were statistically more likely to experience an improvement in their vision than to have worsening or unchanged vision.

However, there is a lack of research into the effect of quarantine masks on skin properties, even though the use of masks has significantly increased after the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the influence of mask use on skin properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty subjects were enrolled in this study. The subjects used approved quarantine masks for 6 hours a day for 2 weeks. We measured eight skin biophysical parameters: temperature, redness, pore volume, texture, elasticity, trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), sebum content, and pH, and evaluated acne lesions before and after using quarantine masks. The evaluation was performed on the mask-wearing area of the face. RESULTS Skin temperature, redness, and TEWL increased significantly after a 6-hour mask use, while the sebum content increased marginally. Skin elasticity was reduced by the use of masks over 1 and 2 weeks, whereas the pore volume and the number of acne lesions increased after a 2-week mask use. The skin changes caused by mask use showed sex-based differences in the skin elasticity (after 6 hours), redness, and roughness (after 2 weeks). CONCLUSIONS The use of quarantine masks causes a change in the skin temperature, redness, and TEWL in the short term and in skin elasticity, pores, and acne in the long term. This study revealed that prolonged mask use could have negative effects on the skin.",2020-12-28,"Kim, Jongwook; Yoo, Suji; Kwon, Oh Sun; Jeong, Eui Taek; Lim, Jun Man; Park, Sun Gyoo",Skin research and technology : official journal of International Society for Bioengineering and the Skin (ISBS) [and] International Society for Digital Imaging of Skin (ISDIS) [and] International Society for Skin Imaging,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1111/srt.12992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33369781/,229690519.0

We aimed at exploiting this effect by combining RNT with immunotherapy in a mouse model of prostate cancer (PC). Experimental Design: C57BL/6-mice bearing syngeneic RM1-PGLS tumors were treated with 225Ac-PSMA617, an anti-PD-1 antibody, or both. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed by tumor volume measurements (computed tomography), time to progression (TTP) and survival. Results: PSMA-RNT or anti-PD-1 alone tended to prolong TTP (isotype-control 25d; anti-PD-1 33.5d, p=0.0153; RNT 30d, p=0.1038) and survival (control 28d; anti-PD-1 37d, p=0.0098; RNT 32d, p=0.1018). Combining PSMA-RNT and anti-PD-1 significantly improved disease control compared to either monotherapy. TTP was extended to 47.5d (p<0.0199 vs. monotherapies), and survival to 51.5d (p<0.0251 vs. monotherapies).

In this study, some experiments were conducted to assess the inactivation of spores inoculated on six materials [stainless steel (SS), painted steel (PS), polyvinyl chlorid (PVC), polyurethane (PU), glass (GS), and cotton cloth (CC)] by CD gas. The main aims of the study were to determine the sporicidal efficacy of CD gas and the effect of prehumidification before decontamination on sporicidal efficacy. METHODS Material coupons (1.2 cm diameter of SS, PS, and PU; 1.0 cm×1.0 cm for PVC, GS, and CC) were contaminated with 10 μl of Bacillus subtilis var. niger (ATCC 9372) spore suspension in mixed organic burden and then dried in a biosafety cabinet for 12 h. The spores were recovered by soaking the coupons in 5 ml of extraction liquid for 1 h and then vortexing the liquid for 1 min. RESULTS The log reductions in spore numbers on inoculated test materials exposed to CD gas [0.080% (volume ratio, v/v) for 3 h] were in the range of from 1.80 to 6.64. Statistically significant differences were found in decontamination efficacies on test material coupons of SS, PS, PU, and CC between with and without a 1-h prehumidification treatment. With the extraction method, there were no statistically significant differences in the recovery ratios between the porous and non-porous materials.

d4cqbvhh,nan,WHO,Automatic segmentation and applicator reconstruction for CT-based brachytherapy of cervical cancer using 3D convolutional neural networks,nan,nan,nan,unk,"In this study, we present deep learning-based approaches to automatic segmentation and applicator reconstruction with high accuracy and efficiency in the planning computed tomography (CT) for cervical cancer brachytherapy (BT). A novel three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was proposed and referred to as DSD-UNET. The dataset of 91 patients received CT-based BT of cervical cancer was used to train and test DSD-UNET model for auto-segmentation of high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) and organs at risk (OARs). Automatic applicator reconstruction was achieved with DSD-UNET-based segmentation of applicator components followed by 3D skeletonization and polynomial curve fitting. Digitization of the channel paths for tandem and ovoid applicator in the planning CT was evaluated utilizing the data from 32 patients. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Jaccard Index (JI), and Hausdorff distance (HD) were used to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy. The segmentation performance of DSD-UNET was compared with that of 3D U-Net. Results showed that DSD-UNET method outperformed 3D U-Net on segmentations of all the structures. The mean DSC values of DSD-UNET method were 86.9%, 82.9%, and 82.1% for bladder, HR-CTV, and rectum, respectively. For the performance of automatic applicator reconstruction, outstanding segmentation accuracy was first achieved for the intrauterine and ovoid tubes (average DSC value of 92.1%, average HD value of 2.3 mm). Finally, HDs between the channel paths determined automatically and manually were 0.88 ± 0.12 mm, 0.95 ± 0.16 mm, and 0.96 ± 0.15 mm for the intrauterine, left ovoid, and right ovoid tubes, respectively. The proposed DSD-UNET method outperformed the 3D U-Net and could segment HR-CTV, bladder, and rectum with relatively good accuracy. Accurate digitization of the channel paths could be achieved with the DSD-UNET-based method. The proposed approaches could be useful to improve the efficiency and consistency of treatment planning for cervical cancer BT.",2020,"Zhang, Daguang; Yang, Zhiyong; Jiang, Shan; Zhou, Zeyang; Meng, Maobin; Wang, Wei",J. appl. clin. med. phys,nan,#32991783,nan,nan,nan,nan,222147851.0

Recent advances in experimental models, methodology, and our understanding of disease processes at the molecular and cellular levels reveal opioid-HIV interactions with increasing clarity. However, despite the substantial new insight, the unique impact of opioids on the severity, progression, and prognosis of neuroHIV and HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) are not fully understood. In this review, we explore, in detail, what is currently known about mechanisms underlying opioid interactions with HIV, with emphasis on individual HIV-1-expressed gene products at the molecular, cellular and systems levels. Furthermore, we review preclinical and clinical studies with a focus on key considerations when addressing questions of whether opioid-HIV interactive pathogenesis results in unique structural or functional deficits not seen with either disease alone. These considerations include, understanding the combined consequences of HIV-1 genetic variants, host variants, and μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and HIV chemokine co-receptor interactions on the comorbidity. Lastly, we present topics that need to be considered in the future to better understand the unique contributions of opioids to the pathophysiology of neuroHIV.

sjnd6c3j,nan,WHO,The role of the critical care pharmacist during the COVID-19 pandemic,nan,nan,nan,unk,"On January 4 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported the emergence of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China due to a new coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2. A few weeks later, hospitals had to put in place a series of drastic measures to deal with the massive influx of suspected COVID-19 (COronaroVIrus Disease) patients while securing regular patient care, in particular in the intensive care units (ICU). Since March 12th, 77 of the 685 COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital required hospitalization in the ICU. What are the roles and the added-value of the critical care pharmacist during this period? His missions have evolved although they have remained focused on providing health services for the patients. Indeed, integrated into a steering committee created to organize the crisis in the intensive care units, the role of the clinical pharmacist was focused on the organization and coordination between ICU and the pharmacy, the implementation of actions to secure practices, to train new professionals and the adaptation of therapeutic strategies.

METHODS From January 2014 to October 2016 53 patients were included retrospectively, using a cross-sectional design. All patients underwent both CTA and CEA. Sixteen patients had their CEA specimen NCCT scanned. The semi-automated CTA software analyzed carotid stenosis using different HU values defining plaque components. The predictive values of CTA based detection of vulnerable plaques were calculated. Quantification of calcifications on CTA using region of interest (ROI)-function and mathematical equations was done manually, and validated by NCCT of the CEA specimen. RESULTS The semi-automated CTA software had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 89.1% (95% CI, 73.6% - 96.4%), 31.3% (95% CI, 12.1% - 58.5%), 75% (95% CI, 59.3% - 86.2%) and 55.6% (95% CI, 22.6% - 84.6%). Strong correlation between in vivo CTA and ex vivo NCCT in quantification of calcification was observed, but CTA systematically underestimated calcificationsscore (CALS) with increasing calcification. CONCLUSION The CTA-software cannot be used in risk assessment of patients, due to poor specificity and NPV. The correlation between in vivo CTA and ex vivo NCCT was strong, proposing it to be used in both scientifically and clinical settings, but studies with larger sample sizes are needed.",2017,"Diab, Hadi Mahmoud Haider; Rasmussen, Lars Melholt; Duvnjak, Stevo; Diederichsen, Axel; Jensen, Pia Søndergaard; Lindholt, Jes Sanddal",BMC medical imaging,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12880-017-0233-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29237404/,29108093.0

We observed a recurring pattern of reduced basal left ventricular (LV) longitudinal strain on speckle-tracking echocardiography in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and subsequently aimed to identify characteristics of affected patients. We hypothesized that patients with COVID-19 with reduced basal LV strain would demonstrate elevated cardiac biomarkers. METHODS AND RESULT: Eighty-one consecutive patients with COVID-19 underwent speckle-tracking echocardiography. Those with poor quality speckle-tracking echocardiography (nâ¯=â¯2) or a known LV ejection fraction of <50% (nâ¯=â¯4) were excluded. Patients with an absolute value basal longitudinal strain of <13.9% (2 standard deviations below normal) were designated as cases (nâ¯=â¯39); those with a basal longitudinal strain of &#8805;13.9% were designated as controls (nâ¯=â¯36). Demographics and clinical variables were compared. Of 75 included patients (mean age 62 ± 14 years, 41% women), 52% had reduced basal strain. Cases had higher body mass index (median 34.1; interquartile range 26.5-37.9 kg/m2 vs median 26.9, interquartile range, 24.8-30.0 kg/m2, Pâ¯=â¯.009), and greater proportions of Black (74% vs 36%, Pâ¯=â¯.0009), hypertensive (79% vs 56%, Pâ¯=â¯.026), and diabetic patients (44% vs 19%, Pâ¯=â¯.025) compared with controls.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of pandemic-related factors on the severity and course of chronic urticaria (CU). METHODS: A total of 194 CU patients who were on regular follow-up, were enrolled in the study. The disease activity was assessed by means of the weekly urticaria activity score (UAS7) and urticaria control test (UCT). Patients were divided into two subgroups according to their disease aggravation as ""aggravated"" and ""non-aggravated"". Two groups were compared in terms of demographic, clinical, COVID-19-associated parameters, and parameters related with the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on CU management. RESULTS: The omalizumab use was statistically higher (P = .017), and the systemic corticosteroid use was statistically lower (P = .025) in the ""aggravated"" group. Adherence to quarantine was significantly lower in the 'aggravated' group (P = .027). 173 patients (89.2%) were unable to contact a dermatologist during the pandemic. Among 186 patients who received treatment for CU before the pandemic, 48 (25.8%) did not continue the existing treatment during the pandemic. CU aggravated in one patient with COVID-19 and remained stable in the other. CONCLUSION: The present study showed that CU patients, especially those on omalizumab therapy, had difficulties in attending medical care and even in the maintenance of their existing therapies during the pandemic.

BACKGROUND At present, COVID-19 is prevalent in the world, seriously endangering the property and life safety of people around the world. Currently, there are many reports on the clinical features, complications and risk factors of death of COVID-19, but there are few reports on the factors associated with the exacerbation of COVID-19. DESIGN Case-control Study. METHODS Patients with COVID-19 were recruited from four designated hospitals for novel coronavirus pneumonia in Xiangyang City, Hubei Province from January to April, 2020. The patients were divided into disease exacerbation group (n = 53) and disease stabilization group (n = 265) according to the disease progression during hospitalization. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify the factors associated with the exacerbation of COVID-19. The research was reported according to STROBE statement. RESULTS Univariate analysis showed there were significant differences in gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, kidney disease, white blood cell count, percentage of neutrophil, percentage of lymphocyte, C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, total protein, albumin, creatinine, calcium ion, rate of erythrocyte sedimentation, cough, expectoration, chest tightness, gastrointestinal discomfort and dyspnea between the two groups. The variables with P < 0.05 in the aforementioned difference analysis were included in binary logistic regression analysis, which showed that age, hypertension history, chest tightness, percentage of neutrophil, percentage of lymphocyte, lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine were independent factors associated with COVID-19 disease exacerbation.

A central mechanism for COVID-19 pathophysiology has been proposed: imbalance of angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE)1 and ACE2 (ACE2 being the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] virus ""receptor"") that results in tissue injury from angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated signaling. This mechanism provides a rationale for multiple therapeutic approaches. In parallel, clinical data from retrospective analysis of COVID-19 cohorts has revealed that ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may be beneficial in COVID-19. These findings have led to the initiation of clinical trials using approved drugs that target the generation (ACEIs) and actions (ARBs) of Ang II. However, treatment of COVID-19 with ACEIs/ARBs poses several challenges. These include choosing appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria, dose optimization, risk of adverse effects and drug interactions, and verification of target engagement. Other approaches related to the RAS pathway might be considered, for example, inhalational administration of ACEIs/ARBs (to deliver drugs directly to the lungs) and use of compounds with other actions (e.g., activation of ACE2, agonism of MAS1 receptors, ß-arrestin-based Angiotensin receptor agonists, and administration of soluble ACE2 or ACE2 peptides). Studies with animal models could test such approaches and assess therapeutic benefit. This Perspective highlights questions whose answers could advance RAS-targeting agents as mechanism-driven ways to blunt tissue injury, morbidity, and mortality of COVID-19.",2020,"Sriram, Krishna; Loomba, Rohit; Insel, Paul A",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,nan,#933767,nan,nan,nan,nan,227038781.0

The characteristic benefit of nanocrystals lies in their ability to boost the bioavailability of such drugs by enhancing their saturation solubility and dissolution velocity. Nanocrystals can be prepared by either bottom-up or top-down approach. The latter is often preferred due to the feasibility of scale-up and economical nature. Hence the emphasis on these methods.Methods: Stable RIF nanocrystals were developed and optimized using media milling and microfluidizer method by incorporating a suitable surfactant/stabilizer. The developed nanocrystals were evaluated for their saturation solubility, in vitro dissolution, solid-state characteristics, morphology, intrinsic dissolution rate, and short-term physical stability.Results: Both the methods were found to be equally efficient in terms of development of stable RIF nanocrystals, while in terms of processing time and efficacy, microfluidization was found to be advantageous. Amorphization and polymorphic conversion were evident based on the results of solid-state characterization. Furthermore, both formulations exhibited an enhanced solubility and faster dissolution velocity.Conclusions: Based on the characterization outcomes, it can be concluded that both the top-down technologies could be successfully applied to develop nanocrystals of poorly water-soluble drugs.

Two types of transcription array were used: cDNA-based macroarrays with a set of 3500 genes (Atlas Human 1.2 arrays; Clontech) and oligonucleotide-based microarrays covering 18,400 transcripts (Human Genome U133A array; Affymetrix). Data analysis was based on statistical frameworks controlling the false-discovery rate. Atlas array data were considered relevant if they could be verified by U133A array or real-time RT-PCR. According to these criteria, there was no evidence for true changes in gene expression. Considering the precision of the U133A array and the number of replicates tested, potential expression changes due to Lassa virus infection are probably smaller than twofold. To substantiate the array data, beta interferon (IFN-beta) gene expression was studied longitudinally in Lassa virus-infected HuH-7 and FRhK-4 cells by using real-time RT-PCR. IFN-beta mRNA levels increased only twofold upon Lassa virus infection, although there was no evidence that the virus inhibited poly(I:C)-induced IFN-beta gene expression. In conclusion, Lassa virus interferes only minimally with gene expression in HuH-7 cells and poorly induces IFN-beta gene transcription.",2007,"Müller, Stefanie; Geffers, Robert; Günther, Stephan",The Journal of general virology,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17412988/,7446656.0
zl9sjlvs,nan,WHO,Strengthening resistance to the COVID-19 pandemic and fostering future resilience requires concerted action on obesity,nan,nan,nan,unk,"Initial observations showed that people with chronic noncommunicable diseases were at heightened risk of severe COVID-19 and adverse outcomes. Subsequently, data from various countries have revealed obesity as an independent and significant factor, with people who are overweight/have obesity significantly more likely to be hospitalized, require ICU treatment, and to die. Notably, this additional risk applies to younger people relative to the general COVID-19 risk profile. This paper sets out the evidence of greater risk of poor COVID outcomes for people who are overweight/have obesity, indication of reduced treatment and support for obesity self-management where it existed prior to COVID-19, and highlights the dearth of specific guidance and measures to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 upon people with obesity. We identify the health, social and economic impacts that this specific vulnerability creates relative to COVID-19 outcomes. Reduced national and global pandemic resilience due to high obesity prevalence should spur governments and funders to provide urgent specific protection and support for people with overweight/obesity, and to commission rapid research to identify effective prevention and reduction measures.

It is of crucial importance to estimate the reproductive number (R0) of the novel virus in the early stage of outbreak and make a prediction of daily new cases on the ship. METHOD: We fitted the reported serial interval (mean and standard deviation) with a gamma distribution and applied “earlyR” package in R to estimate the R0 in the early stage of COVID-19 outbreak. We applied “projections” package in R to simulate the plausible cumulative epidemic trajectories and future daily incidence by fitting the data of existing daily incidence, a serial interval distribution, and the estimated R0 into a model based on the assumption that daily incidence obeys approximately Poisson distribution determined by daily infectiousness. RESULTS: The Maximum-Likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.28 for COVID-19 outbreak at the early stage on the ship. The median with 95% confidence interval (CI) of R0 values was 2.28 (2.06–2.52) estimated by the bootstrap resampling method. The probable number of new cases for the next ten days would gradually increase, and the estimated cumulative cases would reach 1514 (1384–1656) at the tenth day in the future. However, if R0 value was reduced by 25% and 50%, the estimated total number of cumulative cases would be reduced to 1081 (981–1177) and 758 (697–817), respectively. CONCLUSION: The median with 95% CI of R0 of COVID-19 was about 2.28 (2.06–2.52) during the early stage experienced on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The future daily incidence and probable outbreak size is largely dependent on the change of R0.

METHOD: A systematic review was conducted using the terms ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-Cov-2"" and ""second wave"". No relevant citations were found to inform on recommendations the plan. Therefore, an expert panel of the European Hip Society and the European Knee Associates was formed to provide the recommendations. RESULTS: Overall, the recommendations consider three phases; review of the first wave, preparation for the next wave, and during the next wave. International and national policies will drive most of the management. The recommendations focus on the preparation phase and, in particular, the actions that the individual surgeon needs to undertake to continue with, and practice, elective arthroplasty during the next wave, as well as planning their personal and their family's lives. The recommendations expect rigorous data collection during the next wave, so that a cycle of continuous improvement is created to take account of any future waves. CONCLUSIONS: The recommendations for planning to continue elective hip and knee arthroplasty during a new phase of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic provide a framework to reduce the risk of a complete shutdown of elective surgery.

However, little is known about how residential SUD treatment programs are impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This study conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 directors of 20 residential SUD treatment programs across California during the state's shelter-in-place order. The research team analyzed qualitative interview data thematically and coded them using ATLAS.ti software. FINDINGS: Thematic analyses identified six major themes: program-level impacts, staff impacts, client impacts, use of telehealth, program needs, and positive effects. ""Program-level impacts"" were decreased revenue from diminished client censuses and insufficient resources to implement infection control measures. ""Staff impacts"" included layoffs, furloughs, and increased physical and emotional fatigue. ""Client impacts"" were delayed treatment initiation; receipt of fewer services while in treatment; lower retention; and economic and psychosocial barriers to community re-entry. ""Use of telehealth"" included technical and interpersonal challenges associated with telehealth visits. ""Program needs"" were personal protective equipment (PPE), stimulus funding, hazard pay, and consistent public health guidance. ""Positive effects"" of the pandemic response included increased attention to hygiene and health, telehealth expansion, operational improvements, and official recognition of SUD treatment as an essential health care service. CONCLUSION: Study findings highlight COVID-related threats to the survival of residential SUD treatment programs; retention of the SUD treatment workforce; and clients' SUD treatment outcomes. These findings also identify opportunities to improve SUD service delivery and suggest avenues of support for residential SUD treatment facilities during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",2020,"Pagano, Anna; Hosakote, Sindhu; Kapiteni, Kwinoja; Straus, Elana R; Wong, Jessie; Guydish, Joseph R",J Subst Abuse Treat,nan,#988543,nan,nan,nan,nan,229720296.0

xvdhyzhp,nan,WHO,Syndromic Surveillance Insights from a Symptom Assessment App Before and During COVID-19 Measures in Germany and the United Kingdom: Results From Repeated Cross-Sectional Analyses,nan,nan,nan,unk,"BACKGROUND: Unprecedented lockdown measures have been introduced in countries worldwide to mitigate the spread and consequences of COVID-19. Although attention has been focused on the effects of these measures on epidemiological indicators relating directly to the infection, there is increased recognition of their broader health implications. However, assessing these implications in real time is a challenge, due to the limitations of existing syndromic surveillance data and tools. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore the added value of mobile phone app-based symptom assessment tools as real-time health insight providers to inform public health policy makers. METHODS: A comparative and descriptive analysis of the proportion of all self-reported symptoms entered by users during an assessment within the Ada app in Germany and the United Kingdom was conducted between two periods, namely before and after the implementation of ""Phase One"" COVID-19 measures. Additional analyses were performed to explore the association between symptom trends and seasonality, and symptom trends and weather. Differences in the proportion of unique symptoms between the periods were analyzed using a Pearson chi-square test and reported as log2 fold changes. RESULTS: Overall, 48,300-54,900 symptomatic users reported 140,500-170,400 symptoms during the Baseline and Measures periods in Germany. Overall, 34,200-37,400 symptomatic users in the United Kingdom reported 112,100-131,900 symptoms during the Baseline and Measures periods. The majority of symptomatic users were female (Germany: 68,600/103,200, 66.52%; United Kingdom: 51,200/71,600, 72.74%). The majority were aged 10-29 years (Germany: 68,500/100,000, 68.45%; United Kingdom: 50,900/68,800, 73.91%), and about one-quarter were aged 30-59 years (Germany: 26,200/100,000, 26.15%; United Kingdom: 14,900/68,800, 21.65%). Overall, 103 symptoms were reported either more or less frequently (with statistically significant differences) during the Measures period as compared to the Baseline period, and 34 of these were reported in both countries. The following mental health symptoms (log2 fold change, P value) were reported less often during the Measures period: inability to manage constant stress and demands at work (-1.07, P<.001), memory difficulty (-0.56, P<.001), depressed mood (-0.42, P<.001), and impaired concentration (-0.46, P<.001). Diminished sense of taste (2.26, P<.001) and hyposmia (2.20, P<.001) were reported more frequently during the Measures period. None of the 34 symptoms were found to be different between the same dates in 2019. In total, 14 of the 34 symptoms had statistically significant associations with weather variables. CONCLUSIONS: Symptom assessment apps have an important role to play in facilitating improved understanding of the implications of public health policies such as COVID-19 lockdown measures. Not only do they provide the means to complement and cross-validate hypotheses based on data collected through more traditional channels, they can also generate novel insights through a real-time syndromic surveillance system.",2020,"Mehl, Alicia; Bergey, Francois; Cawley, Caoimhe; Gilsdorf, Andreas",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,nan,#809122,nan,nan,nan,nan,219841556.0

Here, using sequence comparisons, we unequivocally reveal the distant sequence similarities between SARS-CoV-2 Orf8 with its SARS-CoV-1 counterparts and the X4-like genes of coronaviruses, including its highly divergent ""paralog"" gene Orf7a, whose product is a potential immune antagonist of known structure. Supervised sequence space walks unravel identity levels that drop below 10% and yet exhibit subtle conservation patterns in this novel superfamily, characterized by an immunoglobulin-like beta sandwich topology. We document the high accuracy of the sequence space walk process in detail and characterize the subgroups of the superfamily in sequence space by systematic annotation of gene and taxon groups. While SARS-CoV-1 Orf7a and Orf8 genes are most similar to bat virus sequences, their SARS-CoV-2 counterparts are closer to pangolin virus homologs, reflecting the fine structure of conservation patterns within the SARS-CoV-2 genomes. The divergence between Orf7a and Orf8 is exceptionally idiosyncratic, since Orf7a is more constrained, whereas Orf8 is subject to rampant change, a peculiar feature that may be related to hitherto-unknown viral infection strategies. Despite their common origin, the Orf7a and Orf8 protein families exhibit different modes of evolutionary trajectories within the coronavirus lineage, which might be partly attributable to their complex interactions with the mammalian host cell, reflected by a multitude of functional associations of Orf8 in SARS-CoV-2 compared to a very small number of interactions discovered for Orf7a.IMPORTANCE Orf8 is one of the most puzzling genes in the SARS lineage of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Using sophisticated sequence comparisons, we confirm its origins from Orf7a, another gene in the lineage that appears as more conserved, compared to Orf8. Orf7a is a potential immune antagonist of known structure, while a deletion of Orf8 was shown to decrease the severity of the infection in a cohort study. The subtle sequence similarities imply that Orf8 has the same immunoglobulin-like fold as Orf7a, confirmed by structure determination.

We cross-validated manual and automated high-throughput testing for SARS-CoV-2-RNA, evaluated SARS-CoV-2 loads in nasopharyngeal-oropharyngeal swabs (NOPS), lower respiratory fluids, and plasma, and analyzed detection rates after lockdown and relaxation measures. METHODS: Basel-S-gene, Roche-E-gene, and Roche-cobas®6800-Target1 and Target2 were prospectively validated in 1344 NOPS submitted during the first pandemic peak (Week 13). Follow-up cohort (FUP) 1, 2, and 3 comprised 10,999, 10,147, and 19,389 NOPS submitted during a 10-week period until Weeks 23, 33, and 43, respectively. RESULTS: Concordant results were obtained in 1308 cases (97%), including 97 (9%) SARS-CoV-2-positives showing high quantitative correlations (Spearman's r > .95; p < .001) for all assays and high precision by Bland-Altman analysis. Discordant samples (N = 36, 3%) had significantly lower SARS-CoV-2 loads (p < .001). Following lockdown, detection rates declined to <1% in FUP-1, reducing single-test positive predictive values from 99.3% to 85.1%. Following relaxation, rates flared up to 4% and 12% in FUP-2 and -3, but infected patients were younger than during lockdown (34 vs. 52 years, p < .001). In 261 patients providing 936 NOPS, SARS-CoV-2 loads declined by three orders of magnitude within 10 days postdiagnosis (p < .001). SARS-CoV-2 loads in NOPS correlated with those in time-matched lower respiratory fluids or in plasma but remained detectable in some cases with negative follow-up NOPS, respectively. CONCLUSION: Manual and automated assays significantly correlated qualitatively and quantitatively. Following a successful lockdown, declining positive predictive values require independent dual-target confirmation for reliable assessment.

We call this ‘stratified periodic testing’. It is ‘stratified’ as it is based on at-risk groups, and ‘periodic’ as everyone in the group is tested at regular intervals. We argue that this is a better use of scarce testing resources than ‘universal random testing’, as has been recently discussed globally. We find that, under reasonable assumptions and allowing for false negative results 30 per cent of the time, 17 per cent of a subgroup would need to be tested each day to lower the effective reproduction number R from 2.5 to 0.75, under stratified periodic testing. Using the same assumptions the universal random testing rate would need to be 27 per cent (as opposed to 7 per cent as argued by Romer (2020b)). We obtain this rate of testing using a corrected method for calculating the impact of an infectious person on others, and allowing for asymptomatic cases. We also find that the effect of one day’s delay between testing positive and self-isolating is similar to having a test that is 30 per cent less accurate.",2020-08-29,"Cleevely, Matthew; Susskind, Daniel; Vines, David; Vines, Louis; Wills, Samuel",nan,nan,nan,nan,document_parses/pdf_json/5ea47818810ebdde55408f29dd4c461542c3fdf6.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7499786.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7499786/,nan

A cluster of cases among health care workers and family members following exposure to a patient with fulminant disease consistent with HGA prompted investigation. OBJECTIVE To investigate the origin and transmission of apparent nosocomial cases of febrile illness in the Anhui Province. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS After exposure to an index patient whose fatal illness was characterized by fever and hemorrhage at a primary care hospital and regional tertiary care hospital's isolation ward, secondary cases with febrile illness who were suspected of being exposed were tested for antibodies against Anaplasma phagocytophilum and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing for A. phagocytophilum DNA. Potential sources of exposure were investigated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Cases with serological or PCR evidence of HGA were compared with uninfected contacts to define the attack rate, relative risk of illness, and potential risks for exposure during the provision of care to the index patient. RESULTS In a regional hospital of Anhui Province, China, between November 9 and 17, 2006, a cluster of 9 febrile patients with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated serum aminotransferase levels were diagnosed with HGA by PCR for A. phagocytophilum DNA in peripheral blood and by seroconversion to A. phagocytophilum. No patients had tick bites. All 9 patients had contact with the index patient within 12 hours of her death from suspected fatal HGA while she experienced extensive hemorrhage and underwent endotracheal intubation. The attack rate was 32.1% vs 0% (P = .04) among contacts exposed at 50 cm or closer, 45% vs 0% (P = .001) among those exposed for more than 2 hours, 75% vs 0% (P < .001) among those reporting contact with blood secretions, and 87.5% vs 0% (P = .004) among those reporting contact with respiratory secretions from the index patient. CONCLUSION We report the identification of HGA in China and likely nosocomial transmission of HGA from direct contact with blood or respiratory secretions.",2008,"Zhang, Lijuan; Liu, Yan; Ni, Daxin; Li, Qun; Yu, Yanlin; Yu, Xue-jie; Wan, Kanglin; Li, Dexin; Liang, Guodong; Jiang, Xiugao; Jing, Huaiqi; Run, Jing; Luan, Mingchun; Fu, Xiuping; Zhang, Jingshan; Yang, Weizhong; Wang, Yu; Dumler, J Stephen; Feng, Zijian; Ren, Jun; Xu, Jianguo",JAMA,nan,nan,nan,nan,nan,https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2008.626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19017912/,205011831.0
