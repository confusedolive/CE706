There is an increasing body of evidence that prophylactic mesh placement (PMP) can be safe and efficient in the short-term outcomes, but there still are some concerns about the potential long-term complications of these meshes. This study describes our long-term PMP experience. METHODS Observational and prospective study including all patients undergoing the use of prophylactic onlay large-pore polypropylene meshes for the closure of ML since 2008 to 2014. Outcome measures included demographics, perioperative details, wound complications, recurrences, reoperations and chronic complications. RESULTS A cohort of 172 patients was analysed: 75% elective surgery, 25% emergency cases. Mean age was 68 years with mean body mass index (BMI) of 28.6 kg/m2. Wound classification: 6.4% clean; 85% clean-contaminated; 1.2% contaminated and 8.1% dirty. Follow-up of patients was up to 8 years (mean: 5 ± 1.6). Two meshes were removed due to chronic infection in first six postoperative months. Of the 13 patients (9.02%) who developed IH, 5 of them have been reoperated for IH repair without any difficulty related to previous mesh. During follow-up, 8 patients have been reoperated for other reasons and the integrity of abdominal wall was also checked. After the comparative study, higher BMI and emergency surgery were still risk factors for IH despite PMP.

How sequence variations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome affect pathogenicity is poorly understood. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the virus with death in SARS-CoV-2 patients is one potential method of early identification of highly pathogenic strains to target for containment. Methods We analyzed 7,548 single stranded RNA-genomes of SARS-CoV-2 patients in the GISAID database (Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017; Shu and McCauley, 2017) and associated variants with reported patient’s health status from COVID-19, i.e. deceased versus non-deceased. We probed each locus of the single stranded RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus for direct association with host/patient mortality using a logistic regression. Results In total, evaluating 29,891 loci of the viral genome for association with patient/host mortality, two loci, at 12,053bp and 25,088bp, achieved genome-wide significance (p-values of 4.09e-09 and 4.41e-23, respectively). Conclusions Mutations at 25,088bp occur in the S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which plays a key role in viral entry of target host cells. Additionally, mutations at 12,053bp are within the ORF1ab gene, in a region encoding for the protein nsp7, which is necessary to form the RNA polymerase complex responsible for viral replication and transcription. Both mutations altered amino acid coding sequences, potentially imposing structural changes that could enhance viral infectivity and symptom severity, and may be important to consider as targets for therapeutic development. Identification of these highly significant associations, unlikely to occur by chance, may assist with COVID-19 early containment of strains that are potentially highly pathogenic.",2020-12-15,"Hahn, Georg; Wu, Chloe M.; Lee, Sanghun; Hecker, Julian; Lutz, Sharon M.; Haneuse, Sebastien; Qiao, Dandi; DeMeo, Dawn; Choudhary, Manish C.; Etemad, Behzad; Mohammadi, Abbas; Esmaeilzadeh, Elmira; Cho, Michael H.; Tanzi, Rudolph E.; Li, Jonathan Z.; Randolph, Adrienne G.; Laird, Nan M.; Weiss, Scott T.; Silverman, Edwin K.; Ribbeck, Katharina; Lange, Christoph",bioRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/0f4ab66bc51c4a1e36d72885fbf9ac7f9e38a768.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.17.386714,227231429.0

A test is an action on a subset of items which returns positive if the subset contains at least one positive and negative otherwise. In non-adaptive group testing, all tests are independent, can be performed in parallel and represented as a measurement matrix. In this work, we consider non-adaptive group testing with consecutive positives in which the items are linearly ordered and the positives are consecutive in that order. We proposed two improved algorithms for efficiently identifying consecutive positives. In particular, without storing measurement matrices, we can identify up to $d$ consecutive positives with $2 \log_2{\frac{n}{d}} + 2d$ ($4 \log_2{\frac{n}{d}} + 2d$, resp.) tests in $O \left( \log_2^2{\frac{n}{d}} + d \right)$ ($O \left( \log_2{\frac{n}{d}} + d \right)$, resp.) time.

The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in utilization and survival rate in patients supported with ECMO for severe respiratory failure in Korea. METHODS: This was a multicenter study on consecutive patients who underwent ECMO across 16 hospitals in Korea. The records of all patients who required ECMO for acute respiratory failure between 2012 and 2015 were retrospectively reviewed, and the utilization of ECMO was analyzed over time. RESULTS: During the study period, 5552 patients received ECMO in Korea as a whole, and a total of 2472 patients received ECMO at the participating 16 hospitals. We analyzed 487 (19.7%) patients who received ECMO for respiratory failure. The number of ECMO procedures provided for respiratory failure increased from 104 to 153 during the study period. The in-hospital survival rate increased from 30.8% to 35.9%. The use of prone positioning increased from 6.8% to 49.0% (p < 0.001), and the use of neuromuscular blockers also increased from 28.2% to 58.2% (p < 0.001).

Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) is one recommended method of thermal control. A wearable device, TempWatch, has been developed to monitor for and detect hypothermia and to promote KMC for preterm and LBW infants. PURPOSE This randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate TempWatch's impact on weight gain, amount of KMC received, and length of hospital stay for LBW infants as compared to standard care. METHODS Otherwise healthy LBW infants (with birthweights 1500-2300 g) admitted to a KMC ward of a government hospital in New Delhi, India were randomly allocated to a TempWatch group or a control group and wore the device until their time of discharge. 50 infants were enrolled in each group. All participants received standard-of-care temperature monitoring, and those in the control group were monitored using the hand-touch method. Each group also received sixth-hourly temperature monitoring. Infants' daily weight and the number of hypothermia episodes they experienced per day were recorded, and mothers of infants in both groups completed daily KMC diaries. RESULTS The TempWatch group experienced statistically significant weight gain as compared to the control group (0.06 vs. 0.02 kg, p = .024). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the number of hypothermia events detected, the amount of KMC received.

The objective of our study was to characterize inactivation of PEDV, PDCoV, and TGEV in various feed ingredient matrices. Samples of complete feed, spray dried porcine plasma, meat meal, meat and bone meal, blood meal, corn, soybean meal, and corn dried distillers grains with solubles were weighed (5 g/sample) into scintillation vials and inoculated with 1 mL of PEDV, PDCoV, or TGEV. Samples were incubated at room temperature for up to 56 days. Aliquots were removed at various time points followed by preparing serial 10-fold dilutions and inoculating in cell cultures to determine the amount of surviving virus. Inactivation kinetics were determined using the Weibull model, which estimates a delta value indicating the time necessary to reduce virus concentration by 1 log. Delta values of various ingredients were compared and analyzed as to their nutrient composition. Soybean meal had the greatest delta value (7.50 days) for PEDV (P < 0.06) as compared with all other ingredients. High delta values (P < 0.001) were observed in soybean meal for PDCoV (42.04 days) and TGEV (42.00 days). There was a moderate correlation between moisture content and the delta value for PDCoV (r = 0.49, P = 0.01) and TGEV (r = 0.41, P = 0.02). There was also a moderate negative correlation between TGEV survival and ether extract content (r = -0.51, P = 0.01). In conclusion, these results indicate that the first log reduction of PDCoV and TGEV takes the greatest amount of time in soybean meal.

This study aims to understand the spatial relationships between COVID-19 infection rate and key variables of air pollution, geo-meteorological, and social parameters in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The relationship was analyzed using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model and Geographic Information System (GIS) by means of COVID-19 infection rate as a dependent variable and 17 independent variables. This study revealed that air pollution parameters like PM2.5 (p < 0.02), AOT (p < 0.01), CO (p < 0.05), water vapor (p < 0.01), and O3 (p < 0.01) were highly correlated with COVID-19 infection rate while geo-meteorological parameters like DEM (p < 0.01), wind pressure (p < 0.01), LST (p < 0.04), rainfall (p < 0.01), and wind speed (p < 0.03) were also similarly associated. Social parameters like population density (p < 0.01), brickfield density (p < 0.02), and poverty level (p < 0.01) showed high coefficients as the key independent variables to COVID-19 infection rate. Significant robust relationships between these factors were found in the middle and southern parts of the city where the reported COVID-19 infection case was also higher.

Furthermore, the effects of an oral rehydration solution (ORS) mixed into milk replacer on the AER were determined. Acetaminophen absorption test (APAT) was performed to estimate the AER. Sixty Holstein-Frisian calves (age < 14 days) were included in the study and divided into groups as follows: healthy calves (H; n = 16), healthy calves fed with ORS (HORS; n = 14), diarrhoeic calves (D; n = 15) and diarrhoeic calves fed with ORS (DORS; n = 15). For the APAT, the calves were fed 2 L of milk replacer containing 50 mg acetaminophen (AP)/kg body weight. Venous blood samples were collected before and after milk replacer and AP intake in 30-60 min intervals for 12 hr. During the APAT, no significant differences in median maximum acetaminophen concentration (Cmax ) were observed among all groups. Time to reach maximum acetaminophen concentration (Tmax ) in DORS (median 390 min, 25/75 quartiles: 300/480 min) was significantly higher compared with that in H (median: 270 min 25/75 quartiles: 210/315 min) and HORS (median: 300 min (25/75 quartiles: 240/360 min). Non-linear regression revealed that the calculated abomasal half-life (AP t1/2 ) tended to be delayed in DORS (median: 652 min, 25/75 quartiles: 445/795 min, p = .10). The area under the AP curve values (AUC) from 0 to 120 min and 0 to 240 min of the observation period were significantly higher in H than D and DORS.

Novel methods of N95 filtering face-piece respirator decontamination that can be scaled-up for in-hospital use can help address this concern and keep healthcare workers (HCWs) safe. METHODS: A multidisciplinary pragmatic study was conducted to evaluate the use of an ultrasonic room high-level disinfection system (HLDS) that generates aerosolized peracetic acid (PAA) and hydrogen peroxide for decontamination of large numbers of N95 respirators. A cycle duration that consistently achieved disinfection of N95 respirators (defined as ≥6 log(10) reductions in bacteriophage MS2 and Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores inoculated onto respirators) was identified. The treated masks were assessed for changes to their hydrophobicity, material structure, strap elasticity, and filtration efficiency. PAA and hydrogen peroxide off-gassing from treated masks were also assessed. RESULTS: The PAA room HLDS was effective for disinfection of bacteriophage MS2 and G. stearothermophilus spores on respirators in a 2,447 cubic-foot (69.6 cubic-meter) room with an aerosol deployment time of 16 minutes and a dwell time of 32 minutes. The total cycle time was 1 hour and 16 minutes. After 5 treatment cycles, no adverse effects were detected on filtration efficiency, structural integrity, or strap elasticity. There was no detectable off-gassing of PAA and hydrogen peroxide from the treated masks at 20 and 60 minutes after the disinfection cycle, respectively.

Blinded analyses confirmed the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and envelope proteins and viral RNA in the three cases and viral absence in the seven controls. A signal for the positive cases was evident in each nasopharyngeal and none of the oral samples. Viral RNA/proteins localized exclusively to glandular cells and was present in high copy number. Blinded analysis of the cytology documented that the glandular cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 showed marked degeneration with ciliocytophthoria; viral inclusions were not evident. Co-expression analysis showed viral infected cells had increased apoptosis, marked by strong expression of activated caspase 3. Weekly serial testing of two of the cases showed persistence of productive viral infection for up to 2 weeks after symptom onset.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare the reliability, overall quality, title–content consistency, and content coverage of Korean-language YouTube videos on COVID-19, which have been uploaded by different sources. METHODS: A total of 200 of the most viewed YouTube videos from January 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020, were screened, searching in Korean for the terms “Coronavirus,” “COVID,” “Corona,” “Wuhan virus,” and “Wuhan pneumonia.” Non-Korean videos and videos that were duplicated, irrelevant, or livestreamed were excluded. Source and video metrics were collected. The videos were scored based on the following criteria: modified DISCERN index, Journal of the American Medical Association Score (JAMAS) benchmark criteria, global quality score (GQS), title–content consistency index (TCCI), and medical information and content index (MICI). RESULTS: Of the 105 total videos, 37.14% (39/105) contained misleading information; independent user–generated videos showed the highest proportion of misleading information at 68.09% (32/47), while all of the government-generated videos were useful. Government agency–generated videos achieved the highest median score of DISCERN (5.0, IQR 5.0-5.0), JAMAS (4.0, IQR 4.0-4.0), GQS (4.0, IQR 3.0-4.5), and TCCI (5.0, IQR 5.0-5.0), while independent user–generated videos achieved the lowest median score of DISCERN (2.0, IQR 1.0-3.0), JAMAS (2.0, IQR 1.5-2.0), GQS (2.0, IQR 1.5-2.0), and TCCI (3.0, IQR 3.0-4.0). However, the total MICI was not significantly different among sources. “Transmission and precautionary measures” were the most commonly covered content by government agencies, news agencies, and independent users. In contrast, the most mentioned content by news agencies was “prevalence,” followed by “transmission and precautionary measures.” CONCLUSIONS: Misleading videos had more likes, fewer comments, and longer running times than useful videos. Korean-language YouTube videos on COVID-19 uploaded by different sources varied significantly in terms of reliability, overall quality, and title–content consistency, but the content coverage was not significantly different. Government-generated videos had higher reliability, overall quality, and title–content consistency than independent user–generated videos.",2020-08-12,"Moon, Hana; Lee, Geon Ho",J Med Internet Res,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7425748.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32730221/; https://doi.org/10.2196/20775,220893469.0

In this virus-cell interaction study, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 infection or viral spike protein expression alone inhibited angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor protein expression. The spike protein promoted an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) mediated signaling cascade, induced the transcriptional regulatory molecules NF-&#954;B and AP-1/c-Fos via MAPK activation, and increased IL-6 release. SARS-CoV-2 infected patient sera contained elevated levels of IL-6 and soluble IL-6R. Up-regulated AT1 receptor signaling also influenced the release of extracellular soluble IL-6R by the induction of the ADAM-17 protease. Use of the AT1 receptor antagonist, Candesartan cilexetil, resulted in down-regulation of IL-6/soluble IL-6R release in spike expressing cells. Phosphorylation of STAT3 at the Tyr705 residue plays an important role as a transcriptional inducer for SOCS3 and MCP-1 expression. Further study indicated that inhibition of STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation in SARS-CoV-2 infected and viral spike protein expressing epithelial cells did not induce SOCS3 and MCP-1 expression. Introduction of culture supernatant from SARS-CoV-2 spike expressing cells on a model human liver endothelial cell line (TMNK-1), where transmembrane IL-6R is poorly expressed, resulted in the induction of STAT3 Tyr705 phosphorylation as well as MCP-1 expression.

METHODS Records from the Provincial Transfer Authorization Centre and Toronto Public Health from April 1 to July 31, 2003, were linked using probabilistic methods. Authorization decision (transfer authorized or denied) and SARS status (probable case, suspect case, or patient under investigation for SARS; or non-SARS case) were obtained for linked records. Primary outcome was the number of patients where correct authorization decisions were made based on SARS status at the time of request. Secondary outcome was the number for whom, in retrospect, authorization decision was correct knowing final SARS status. Algorithm sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were determined. RESULTS There were 14,571 requests for transfer and 2,132 patients investigated for SARS during the study period. The algorithm authorized 14,551 and did not authorize 20 requests. Sensitivity and specificity to make appropriate authorization decisions at the time of request were 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77.2%-100%) and 99.95% (95% CI, 99.9-100%), respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 65% (95% CI, 44.1%-85.9%) and 100% (95% CI, 98.4%-100%), respectively. Sensitivity and specificity, in retrospect, within ten days of the transfer request were 100% (95% CI, 80.6%-100%) and 99.97% (95% CI, 99.9%-100%), respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 80% (95% CI, 62.5%-97.5%) and 100% (95% CI, 98.4%-100%), respectively.

In this review, how HCA can be used to give insight into this last category of foldable segments is illustrated, with examples matching known 3D structures. After reviewing the HCA principles, examples of short foldable segments are given, which often contain short linear motifs, typically matching hydrophobic clusters. These segments become ordered upon contact with partners, with secondary structure preferences generally corresponding to those observed in the 3D structures within the complexes. Such small foldable segments are sometimes larger than the segments of known 3D structures, including flanking hydrophobic clusters that may be critical for interaction specificity or regulation, as well as intervening sequences allowing fuzziness.

METHODS From January 2012 and March 2016, 60 eligible patients with chronic lateral ankle instability (CLAI) received all arthroscopic remnant-preserving reconstruction or open reconstruction of the anterior talofibular ligament and calcaneofibular ligament using semitendinosus autograft. They were divided into the arthroscopic group (n = 28) and the open group (n = 32). The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS),visual analog scale (VAS), and Karlsson scores and ankle range of motion (ROM) were used to evaluate clinical outcomes pre-operatively and at six and 12 months and the final follow-up of at least 24 months post-operatively, with SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores evaluated for quality of life, and the anterior talar translation and talar tilt measurements for radiologic outcomes. RESULTS There was no difference in pre-operative demographics between two groups (P > 0.05). At the final follow-up, the AOFAS, VAS, Karlsson, SF-36 PCS, and MCS scores improved significantly in both groups (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference was found in AOFAS (91.9 ± 6.8 vs 91.1 ± 5.5), VAS (2.7 ± 1.7 vs 2.5 ± 1.6), Karlsson (95.3 ± 6.7 vs 94.8 ± 6.5), SF-36 PCS (53.2 ± 6.1 vs 52.9 ± 5.7), and MCS scores (55.7 ± 5.8 vs 54.2 ± 5.4) between the two groups (P > 0.05).

Modifiable risk factors of dementia and AD include lifestyle-related factors, vascular and metabolic disorders, and psychosocial factors. Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are needed to clarify whether modifying such factors can prevent or postpone cognitive impairment and dementia in older adults. Given the complex, multifactorial, and heterogeneous nature of late-onset AD and dementia, interventions targeting several risk factors and mechanisms simultaneously may be required for optimal preventive effects. The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) is the first large, long-term RCT to demonstrate that a multidomain lifestyle-based intervention ameliorating vascular and lifestyle-related risk factors can preserve cognitive functioning and reduce the risk of cognitive decline among older adults at increased risk of dementia. To investigate the multidomain intervention in other populations and diverse cultural and geographical settings, the World-Wide FINGERS (WW-FINGERS) network was recently launched (https://alz.org/wwfingers). Within this network, new FINGER-type trials with shared core methodology, but local culture and context-specific adaptations, will be conducted in several countries. The WW-FINGERS initiative facilitates international collaborations, provides a platform for testing multidomain strategies to prevent cognitive impairment and dementia, and aims at generating high-quality scientific evidence to support public health and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, the WW-FINGERS network can support the implementation of preventive strategies and translation of research findings into practice.",2019-10-10,"Rosenberg, A.; Mangialasche, F.; Ngandu, T.; Solomon, A.; Kivipelto, Miia",J Prev Alzheimers Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b6fbfcb507d5a5002b7660ea787e0d5ef696abee.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7222931.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222931/,

A lot of factors have contributed to it: deforestation, changes in forest habitats, poorly regulated agricultural surfaces, mismanaged urban growth. They have altered the composition of wildlife communities, greatly increased the contacts of humans with wildlife, and altered niches that harbor pathogens, increasing their chances to come in contact with humans. Among the wildlife, bats have adapted easily to anthropized environments such as houses, barns, cultivated fields, orchards, where they found the suitable ecosystem to prosper. Bats are major hosts for &#945;CoV and ßCoV: evolution has shaped their peculiar physiology and their immune system in a way that makes them resistant to viral pathogens that would instead successfully attack other species, including humans. In time, the coronaviruses that bats host as reservoirs have undergone recombination and other modifications that have increased their ability for inter-species transmission: one modification of particular importance has been the development of the ability to use ACE2 as a receptor in host cells.

The preventive behaviors of individuals (e.g., home quarantine, disinfection, and wearing masks) play a key role in preserving and controlling the disease. In this case, as a motivational psychological system oriented toward avoiding infection, the behavioral immune system (BIS) may be activated and link to preventive behaviors. This study investigated the mechanisms through which emotional and cognitive processes resulted by BIS have promoted preventive behaviors in relation to COVID-19. We collected data on 22,005 active Sina Weibo users from 31 December 2019 to 8 February 2020 to measure their emotions (including disgust, happiness, and fear), cultural values (individualism and collectivism), moral concern (including purity vice, fairness vice, and authority virtue), and behavioral intentions (including isolation intention, protection intention, and aid intention) using Text Mind software and related dictionaries. Multiple regression and mediation analyses were performed to explore the relationships among variables. The results showed seven complete mediation paths (such as disgust–purity vice–protection intention). Each of these paths describes the effects of cognitive processes caused by BIS on preventive behaviors. We inferred that there may be path mechanisms such as disgust–cognitive processes–preventive behaviors. Using these results, policy makers can take appropriate measures to intervene in preventive behaviors (e.g., by posting disgusting images on social media to evoke disgust). The results can be used to explain differences in preventive behaviors among populations even in the face of similar thread levels.

Design A cohort study using data from the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS). We used ONS published data for general population mortality rates. Setting: Hospital Episode Statistics for England 2003 onwards, and linked data from the NHS Personal Demographics Service. Participants: 168,691 people with RAIRD who were alive on 1 March 2020. Their median age was 61.7 (IQR 41.5-75.4) years, and 118,379 (70.2%) were female. Our case ascertainment methods had a positive predictive value >85%. Main outcome measure: Age-standardised mortality rates for all-cause death. Secondary outcome measures were age-sex standardised mortality rates, and age-stratified mortality rates. Results: 1,815 (1.1%) participants died during March and April 2020. The age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR) among people with RAIRD (3669.3, 95% CI 3500.4-3838.1 per 100,000 person-years) was 1.44 (95% CI 1.42-1.45) times higher than the average ASMR during the same months of the previous 5 years, whereas in the general population of England it was 1.38 times higher. Compared to the general population, the age-specific mortality rates in people with RAIRD compared to the pre-COVID rates were higher from the age of 35 upwards, whereas in the general population the increased risk began from age 55 upwards. Sex-specific rates were similar in males and females, whereas in the general population females had a lower rate than males. Conclusions: The risk of all-cause death is more prominently raised during COVID-19 among people with RAIRD than among the general population.

PCBs are present in the environment as mixtures of multiple isomers at different degree of chlorination. These compounds are manmade and possess useful industrial properties including extreme longevity under harsh conditions, heat absorbance, and the ability to form an oily liquid at room temperature that is useful for electrical utilities and in other industrial applications. They have been widely used for a wide range of industrial purposes over the decades. Despite a ban in production in 1979 in the US and many other countries, they remain persistent and ubiquitous in environment as contaminants due to their improper disposal. Humans, independent of where they live, are therefore exposed to PCBs, which are routinely found in random surveys of human and animal tissues. The prolonged exposures to PCBs have been associated with the development of different diseases and disorders, and they are classified as endocrine disruptors. Due to its ability to interact with thyroid hormone, metabolism and function, they are thought to be implicated in the global rise of obesity diabetes, and their potential toxicity for neurodevelopment and disorders, an example of gene by environmental interaction (GxE). The current review is primarily intended to summarize the evidence for the association of PCB exposures with increased risks for metabolic dysfunctions and neurobehavioral disorders. In particular, we present evidence of gene expression alterations in PCB-exposed populations to construct the underlying pathways that may lead to those diseases and disorders in course of life.

Equally important will be the development of new highly sensitive diagnostic methods for use in the detection of these agents in donor animals and for the monitoring of transplant recipients. Herein, we report results from a panel of 30 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays for infectious agents with the potential to be transmitted to the human host.

New tools are needed to distinguish dengue from other febrile illnesses. In addition, the natural history of pediatric dengue early in illness in a community-based setting has not been well-defined. METHODS: Data from the multi-year, ongoing Pediatric Dengue Cohort Study of approximately 3,800 children aged 2–14 years in Managua, Nicaragua, were used to examine the frequency of clinical signs and symptoms by day of illness and to generate models for the association of signs and symptoms during the early phase of illness and over the entire course of illness with testing dengue-positive. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using generalized estimating equations (GEE) for repeated measures, adjusting for age and gender. RESULTS: One-fourth of children who tested dengue-positive did not meet the WHO case definition for suspected dengue. The frequency of signs and symptoms varied by day of illness, dengue status, and disease severity. Multivariable GEE models showed increased odds of testing dengue-positive associated with fever, headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, petechiae, positive tourniquet test, vomiting, leukopenia, platelets ≤150,000 cells/mL, poor capillary refill, cold extremities and hypotension. Estimated ORs tended to be higher for signs and symptoms over the course of illness compared to the early phase of illness. CONCLUSIONS: Day-by-day analysis of clinical signs and symptoms together with longitudinal statistical analysis showed significant associations with testing dengue-positive and important differences during the early phase of illness compared to the entire course of illness.

We described Covid-19 cumulative incidence, treatment outcome, mortality, and associated risk factors. RESULTS: We detected 45/1069 Covid-19 diagnoses in cancer patients vs 42,450/6,662,000 in total population (p < 0.00001). Mortality rate: 19/45 cancer patients vs 5586/42,450 (p = 0.0001). Mortality was associated with older median age, adjusted by staging and histology (74 vs 63.5 years old, OR 1.06, p = 0.03). Patients who combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin presented 3/18 deaths, regardless of age, staging, histology, cancer treatment and comorbidities (OR 0.02, p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: Cancer patients are vulnerable to Covid-19 with an increase in complications.

The fluorescence-labeled HBV antigen and the antibody against SCVe were then utilized to examine specific interactions on the PHA-coated surfaces. Fluorescence signals were detected only at the spotted positions, thereby indicating a high degree of affinity and selectivity for their corresponding antigens/antibodies. Furthermore, we detected small amounts of ScFv-SBD (2.7 ng/mL) and SCVe-SBD fusion proteins (0.6 ng/mL).

We found Neurexin1α knockouts exhibited reduced selection of beneficial outcomes and impaired avoidance of costlier options. Reinforcement modeling suggested that this was driven by deficits in updating and representation of value. Disruption of Neurexin1α within telencephalic excitatory projection neurons, but not thalamic neurons, recapitulated choice abnormalities of global Neurexin1α knockouts. Furthermore, this selective forebrain excitatory knockout of Neurexin1α perturbed value-modulated neural signals within striatum, a central node in feedback-based reinforcement learning.

Two well-known facets of the invisible hand are generally mentioned in the economics and finance literature - the first one is a static picture of a perfectly competitive market, i.e., a competitive market is efficient in an equilibrium; and the second one is that if the competitive market is disturbed from its equilibrium position, in the absence of a market failure and frictions, the market automatically settles at a new efficient equilibrium. This paper takes into account a third facet, i.e., how efficient is a perfectly competitive financial market on the dynamic adjustment path after an economic shock in the absence of all kinds of frictions and interest rate rigidities. We conclude that coordinated actions of economic agents can result in a level of economic efficiency on the dynamic adjustment path which is not achievable by a free market mechanism.

249110,zg1x5ef6,,WHO,openEHR Archetype Use and Reuse Within Multilingual Clinical Data Sets: Case Study,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Despite electronic health records being in existence for over 50 years, our ability to exchange health data remains frustratingly limited. Commonly used clinical content standards, and the information models that underpin them, are primarily related to health data exchange, and so are usually document- or message-focused. In contrast, over the past 12 years, the Clinical Models program at openEHR International has gradually established a governed, coordinated, and coherent ecosystem of clinical information models, known as openEHR archetypes. Each archetype is designed as a maximal data set for a universal use-case, intended for reuse across various health data sets, known as openEHR templates. To date, only anecdotal evidence has been available to indicate if the hypothesis of archetype reuse across templates is feasible and scalable. As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, between February and July 2020, 7 openEHR templates were independently created to represent COVID-19-related data sets for symptom screening, confirmed infection reporting, clinical decision support, and research. Each of the templates prioritized reuse of existing use-case agnostic archetypes found in openEHR International's online Clinical Knowledge Manager tool as much as possible. This study is the first opportunity to investigate archetype reuse within a range of diverse, multilingual openEHR templates. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the use and reuse of openEHR archetypes across the 7 openEHR templates as an initial investigation about the reuse of information models across data sets used for a variety of clinical purposes. METHODS: Analysis of both the number of occurrences of archetypes and patterns of occurrence within 7 discrete templates was carried out at the archetype or clinical concept level. RESULTS: Across all 7 templates collectively, 203 instances of 58 unique archetypes were used. The most frequently used archetype occurred 24 times across 4 of the 7 templates. Total data points per template ranged from 40 to 179. Archetype instances per template ranged from 10 to 62. Unique archetype occurrences ranged from 10 to 28. Existing archetype reuse of use-case agnostic archetypes ranged from 40% to 90%. Total reuse of use-case agnostic archetypes ranged from 40% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Investigation of the amount of archetype reuse across the 7 openEHR templates in this initial study has demonstrated significant reuse of archetypes, even across unanticipated, novel modeling challenges and multilingual deployments. While the trigger for the development of each of these templates was the COVID-19 pandemic, the templates represented a variety of types of data sets: symptom screening, infection report, clinical decision support for diagnosis and treatment, and secondary use or research. The findings support the openEHR hypothesis that it is possible to create a shared, public library of standards-based, vendor-neutral clinical information models that can be reused across a diverse range of health data sets.",2020,"Leslie, Heather",J Med Internet Res,,#840820,,,,,222256756.0

DESIGN A scoping review using a six-stage methodological framework was used to capture a range of evidence describing how professional identity has been conceptualized and integrated into nursing curriculum. DATA SOURCES Databases searched included: Ovid MEDLINE: Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE® Daily and Ovid MEDLINE® 1946-Present, EBSCO CINAHL (1981 to present), OVID PsycINFO (1806 to Present), ProQuest ERIC, ASSIA, and Sociological Abstracts. Additional studies were identified by scanning the reference lists of relevant articles. REVIEW METHODS The study team collaboratively designed the data charting table and two coauthors independently screened the studies using Covidence software. Qualitative content analysis was used to categorize learning outcomes into five components of professional identity that were associated with pedagogical practices identified in the studies. RESULTS A total of 114 peer-reviewed journal articles were initially charted. Articles were categorized as intervention studies (46, 40%), perspective studies (40, 35%), theoretical papers (17, 15%), or reviews (11, 10%). To ensure feasibility in collating and reporting the results, the review focused on the 46 empirical intervention studies that described associations between pedagogical practices and professional identity formation learning outcomes for students. CONCLUSIONS This scoping review illustrates the range of contexts in which nursing students learn, the multidimensional nature of identity formation, as well as the breadth of pedagogical practices and learning outcomes that guide course design.

But the role of immune dysregulation of malignant patients on poor prognosis of COVID-19 has remained insufficiently investigated. Here we conducted a retrospective cohort study that included 2,052 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 (Cancer, n = 93; Non-cancer, n = 1,959), and compared the immunological characteristics of both cohorts. We used stratification analysis, multivariate regressions, and propensity-score matching to evaluate the effect of immunological indices. In result, COVID-19 patients with cancer had ongoing and significantly elevated inflammatory factors and cytokines (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, IL-6, IL-8), as well as decreased immune cells (CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, B cells, NK cells, Th and Ts cells) than those without cancer. The mortality rate was significantly higher in cancer cohort (24.7%) than non-cancer cohort (10.8%). By stratification analysis, COVID-19 patients with immune dysregulation had poorer prognosis than those with the relatively normal immune system both in cancer and non-cancer cohort. By logistic regression, Cox regression, and propensity-score matching, we found that prior to adjustment for immunological indices, cancer history was associated with an increased mortality risk of COVID-19 (p < .05); after adjustment for immunological indices, cancer history was no longer an independent risk factor for poor prognosis of COVID-19 (p > .30). In conclusion, COVID-19 patients with cancer had more severely dysregulated immune responses than noncancerous patients, which might account for their poorer prognosis.

METHODS: Claimed subjects to the Korean National Health Insurance claims database diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. Ten thousand sixty-nine patients with COVID-19 between January 28 and April 5, 2020, were included. Stratified random sampling of 1:5 was used to select the control group of COVID-19 patients. In total 50,587 subjects were selected as the control group. After deleting the missing values, 60,656 subjects were included. RESULTS: Adjusted odds ratio (OR) indicated that diabetic insulin users had a higher risk of COVID-19 than subjects without diabetes (OR, 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03 to 1.53; P=0.0278). In the subgroup analysis, infection risk was higher among diabetes male insulin users (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.89), those between 40 and 59 years (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.13 to 2.44). The infection risk was higher in diabetic insulin users with 2 to 4 years of morbidity (OR, 1.744; 95% CI, 1.003 to 3.044).

Short telomere length (TL) is associated with chronic diseases and immunosenescence. The main risk factor for mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is older age, but outcome is very heterogeneous among individuals of the same age group. Therefore, we hypothesized that TL influences COVID-19-related outcomes. In a prospective study, we measured TL by Flow-FISH in 70 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and compared TL distribution with our reference cohort of 491 healthy volunteers. We also correlated TL with baseline clinical and biological parameters. We stained autopsy lung tissue from six non-survivor COVID-19 patients to detect senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity, a marker of cellular aging. We found a significantly higher proportion of patients with short telomeres (<10(th) percentile) in the COVID-19 patients as compared to the reference cohort (P<0.001). Short telomeres were associated with a higher risk of critical disease, defined as admission to intensive care unit (ICU) or death without ICU. TL was negatively correlated with C-reactive protein and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Finally, lung tissue from patients with very short telomeres exhibit signs of senescence in structural and immune cells.

Seven electronic databases and relevant resources were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients using noninvasive ventilation at PIC window with those continuing receiving invasive ventilation. Retrieved citations were screened, risk of bias was assessed, and data were extracted by 2 independent review authors. Overall effect sizes were synthesized by using meta-analyses. Quality of evidence was rated by using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. A total of 17 trials involving 959 participants were included for this review. Compared with continuous invasive ventilation, noninvasive ventilation used at PIC window significantly reduced mortality, ventilator-associated pneumonia, weaning failures, reintubations, duration of invasive ventilation, total duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay (LOS) in intensive care unit, and LOS in hospital as well as hospital costs. Of these, mortality significantly decreased (risk ratio = 0.27, 95% confidence interval: 0.17–0.42, P < 0.001) without significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 0%, P = 0.99). Quality of evidence regarding the 9 outcomes across the included studies was rated from moderate to low. Use of noninvasive ventilation at PIC window showed beneficial effects across identified trials for ARF in AECOPD patients.

METHODS: We collected data of 100 patients diagnosed as severe type of COVID-19 from February 8 to April 10, 2020, including demographics, illness history, physical examination, laboratory test, and treatment. In-hospital mortality were observed. Cardiac damage was defined as plasma hypersensitive troponin I (hsTnI) over 34.2 pg/ml and/or N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) above 450 pg/ml at the age < 50, above 900 pg/ml at the age < 75, or above 1800 pg/ml at the age &#8805; 75. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 62.0 years old. 69 (69.0%) had comorbidities, mainly presenting hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Fever (69 [69.0%]), cough (63 [63.0%]), chest distress (13 [13.0%]), and fatigue (12 [12.0%]) were the common initial symptoms. Cardiac damage occurred in 25 patients.

In Taiwan, most cases to date were imported or linked to imported cases. METHODS: In collaboration with Facebook Data for Good, we characterized changes in movement patterns in Taiwan since February 2020, and built metapopulation models that incorporate human movement data to identify the high risk areas of disease spread and assess the potential effects of local travel restrictions in Taiwan. RESULTS: We found that mobility changed with the number of local cases in Taiwan in the past few months. For each city, we identified the most highly connected areas that may serve as sources of importation during an outbreak. We showed that the risk of an outbreak in Taiwan is enhanced if initial infections occur around holidays. Intracity travel reductions have a higher impact on the risk of an outbreak than intercity travel reductions, while intercity travel reductions can narrow the scope of the outbreak and help target resources. The timing, duration, and level of travel reduction together determine the impact of travel reductions on the number of infections, and multiple combinations of these can result in similar impact. CONCLUSIONS: To prepare for the potential spread within Taiwan, we utilized Facebook’s aggregated and anonymized movement and colocation data to identify cities with higher risk of infection and regional importation. We developed an interactive application that allows users to vary inputs and assumptions and shows the spatial spread of the disease and the impact of intercity and intracity travel reduction under different initial conditions.

This review aims to describe the pattern of influenza B occurrence in Brazil to have a better understanding of its epidemiology and its relevance when considering seasonal influenza vaccine composition. A review of the data including analysis of international and local surveillance data as well as information from online search of databases using Medical Subject Headings terms in conjunction with screening of abstracts from scientific events was performed. Based on international epidemiologic surveillance data, moderate levels of influenza B disease (19%; 2006–2014) were observed. Of these nine years, it was possible to compare data from three years (2007, 2008 and 2013) which have information on the circulating influenza B lineage. Co-circulation of influenza B lineages was observed in all these three influenza seasons, of which, during one season, a high degree of mismatch between the vaccine lineage and the predominant circulating lineage (91.4% [2013]) was observed. Local surveillance data reveal a distinct and dynamic distribution of respiratory viruses over the years. Data from published literature and abstracts show that influenza B is a significant cause of disease with an unpredictable circulation pattern and showing trends indicating reemergence of the B/Victoria lineage. The abstracts report notable levels of co-circulation of both influenza B lineages (2000–2013). Mismatch between the Southern hemisphere vaccine and the most prevalent circulating viruses in Brazil were observed in five influenza seasons. The evidence on co-circulation of two influenza B lineages and mismatched seasons in Brazil indicates the benefit of quadrivalent influenza vaccines in conferring broader seasonal influenza protection.

Nevertheless, intestinal inflammation has shown an important risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and prognosis. Therefore, we investigated the role of intestinal inflammation on the viral intestinal entry mechanisms, including ACE2, in IBD. METHODS: We collected inflamed and uninflamed mucosal biopsies from CD (n=193) and UC (n=158) patients, and 51 matched non-IBD controls for RNA sequencing, differential gene expression and co-expression analysis. Organoids from UC patients were subjected to an inflammatory mix and processed for RNA sequencing. Transmural ileal biopsies were processed for single-cell (sc) sequencing. Publicly available colonic sc-RNA sequencing data, and microarrays from tissue pre/post anti-TNF therapy, were analyzed. RESULTS: In inflamed CD ileum, ACE2 was significantly decreased compared to control ileum (p=4.6E-07), whereas colonic ACE2 was higher in inflamed colon of CD/UC compared to control (p=8.3E-03; p=1.9E-03). Sc-RNA sequencing confirmed this ACE2 dysregulation, and exclusive epithelial ACE2 expression. Network analyses highlighted HNF4A as key regulator of ileal ACE2, while pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferon regulating factors regulated colonic ACE2. Inflammatory stimuli upregulated ACE2 in UC organoids (p=1.7E-02), not in non-IBD controls (p=9.1E-01). Anti-TNF therapy restored colonic ACE2 regulation in responders.

Published results obtained recently at this laboratory show that D. radiodurans submitted to ionizing radiation results in its DNA being shattered into small fragments which, when exposed to a ""static electric field' (SEF), greatly decreases cell viability. These findings motivated the performing of D. radiodurans exposed to gamma radiation, yet exposed to a different exogenous physical agent, ""static magnetic fields"" (SMF). Cells of D. radiodurans [strain D.r. GY 9613 (R1)] in the exponential phase were submitted to 60Co gamma radiation from a gamma cell. Samples were exposed to doses in the interval 0.5-12.5 kGy, while the control samples were kept next to the irradiation setup. Exposures to SMF were carried out with intensities of 0.08 T and 0.8 T delivered by two settings: (a) a device built up at this laboratory with niobium magnets, delivering 0.08 T, and (b) an electromagnet (Walker Scientific) generating static magnetic fields with intensities from 0.1 to 0.8 T. All samples were placed in a bacteriological incubator at 30 °C for 48 h, and after incubation, a counting of colony forming units was performed. Two sets of cell surviving data were measured, each in triplicate, obtained in independent experiments. A remarkable similarity between the two data sets is revealed, underscoring reproducibility within the 5% range. Appraisal of raw data shows that exposure of irradiated cells to SMF substantially increases their viability. Data interpretation strongly suggests that the increase of D. radiodurans cell viability is a sole magnetic physical effect, driven by a stochastic process, improving the efficiency of the rejoining of DNA fragments, thus increasing cell viability. A type of cut-off dose is identified at 10 kGy, above which the irradiated cellular system loses recovery and the cell survival mechanism collapses.",2020-08-18,"Righi, Henriette; Arruda-Neto, João D T; Gomez, José G C; da Silva, Luiziana F; Somessari, Elizabeth S R; Lemos, Aline C C",Journal of biological physics,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10867-020-09554-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32809182/,221166138.0

Feeling isolated from and having no contact with close relatives or carers was prominent. The COVID-19 pandemic created fear and anxiety among hospitalized patients. Relationships with family members and some staff became strained. The transformation from being ""a person"" to being ""a patient"" and loss of dignity, autonomy and a ""sense of self"" were themes identified in the analysis. Although virtual contact can't replace the real world, the use of technology to maintain contact with family and carers, and the need for help from hospital staff in facilitating this contact was deemed important. The environment of care was a prominent theme. The attitude of staff made a difference to how patients felt and some patients expressed a loss of decision-making capability. The interviews were challenging in some cases because the interviews had to be interrupted or shortened due to ethical considerations around the individual person's needs and condition. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATION FOR PRACTICE: Our study provided in-depth knowledge on how older patients experienced hospitalisation during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Danish hospital. The results emphasise that compassionate care includes a willingness to listen to older patients' narratives and to imagine life as depicted by them. This can lead to better understanding of an individual person's needs and increase the quality of care provided.",2021,"Nielsen, Dorthe Susanne; Hansen, Rikke Frøslev; Beck, Sanne Have; Wensien, Jette; Masud, Tahir; Ryg, Jesper",Int J Older People Nurs,,#1004019,,,,,230488293.0

The virus replicates not only in the epithelium of upper and lower respiratory tract tissues, but also in many tissues along the alimentary tract and elsewhere e.g. kidney, oviduct and testes. It can be detected in both respiratory and faecal material. There is increasing evidence that IBV can infect species of bird other than the chicken. Interestingly breeds of chicken vary with respect to the severity of infection with IBV, which may be related to the immune response. Probably the major reason for the high profile of IBV is the existence of a very large number of serotypes. Both live and inactivated IB vaccines are used extensively, the latter requiring priming by the former. Their effectiveness is diminished by poor cross-protection. The nature of the protective immune response to IBV is poorly understood. What is known is that the surface spike protein, indeed the amino-terminal S1 half, is sufficient to induce good protective immunity. There is increasing evidence that only a few amino acid differences amongst S proteins are sufficient to have a detrimental impact on cross-protection.

We generated recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) LC16m8 strain which simultaneously expresses four structural proteins of SARS-CoV, including nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), envelop (E), spike (S) proteins (rVV-NMES) and reported that old BALB/c mice having prior immunization with rVV-NMES develop severe pneumonia similar to those of control mice though rVV-NMES-immunized mice showed lower pulmonary viral titer than in the control mice. Furthermore, we determined which SARS-CoV structural protein for the prior rVV-immunization is responsible for the severe pneumonia after the SARS-CoV infection as observed in the rVV-NMES-immunized mice. Old BALB/c mice were inoculated intradermally with rVV that expressed each structural proteins of SARS-CoV (rVV-N, -M, -E, or -S) with or without rVV-S and then infected intranasally with SARS-CoV more than 4 weeks later. At 9 days after SARS-CoV infection, the rVV-N-immunized mice show more severe pneumonia than in other groups. Furthermore, significant up-regulation of Th1 (IL-2)- and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-5)-bias cytokines and down-regulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10 and TGF-β) were observed in rVV-N-immunized mice, resulting in the intensive infiltration of immunocompetent cells into the lung. In contrast, rVV-S-immunized mice showed only low pulmonary viral tier and slight pneumonia. However, the mice having co-immunization with both rVV-N and rVV-S showed severe pneumonia though their pulmonary viral titer was low. These results suggest that an excessive host immune response against the N protein of SARS-CoV is involved in severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV infection. These findings increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of SARS.",2010-12-31,"Yasui, Fumihiko; Kai, Chieko; Saito, Kousuke; Inoue, Shingo; Yoneda, Misako; Morita, Kouichi; Mizuno, Kyosuke; Kohara, Michinori",Procedia in Vaccinology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/b0d6f76af8ad26a7f3a1efe0a089cf4de5d2ef57.json,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.provac.2010.03.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288911/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1877282X1000010X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877282X1000010X,84195170.0

In this work, an alternative full-face mask is adapted from a modified snorkel mask to be used as PPE with two medical-grade filters and a 3D-printed adapter. Since the mask covers the eyes, mouth, and nose, it acts as a full-face shield, providing additional protection to healthcare workers. The SARS-CoV-2 has a size between 60 nm and 140 nm, and airborne viral particles can be carried by larger droplets with sizes up to several millimeters. The minimum filtration efficiency of mechanical and electrostatic filters is usually reached between 30 nm and 300 nm. The filtration efficiency of different medical filters is measured for particles below 300 nm to cover the size of the SARS-CoV-2 and small virus-laden droplets, and determine the minimum efficiency. The filtration performance of the adapted full-face mask is characterized using NaCl particles below 500 nm and different fitting scenarios to determine the minimum protection efficiency. The mask is compared to a commercial respirator and characterized according to the EN 149 standard, demonstrating that the protection fulfills the requirements for the FFP2 level (filtering face-piece 2, stopping at least 94% of airborne particles). The device shows a good resistance to several cycles of decontamination (autoclaving and ethanol immersion), is easy to be produced locally at low cost, and helps to address the shortage in FFP2 masks and face shields by providing adequate protection to healthcare workers against particles <500 nm in size.",2021,"Schmitt, Jean; Jones, Lewis S; Aeby, Elise A; Gloor, Christian; Moser, Berthold; Wang, Jing",Chem Res Toxicol,,#983873,,,,,221140533.0

During the next days the kidney function improved and liver function started to recover. Four days after admission, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric ward. Urine, serum, plasma and whole-blood samples were analyzed for ricinine using a quantitative LC-MS-MS method. Initial values on admission (serum and urine) were very high in comparison with previously reported cases. Based on these values, the patient was monitored closely in the following days. The patient made a full recovery and during the course of hospitalization, concentrations of ricinine in plasma/serum, blood and urine gradually declined. The presence of ricinine in a patient's blood or plasma is proof of castor bean, hence, ricin exposure. However, based on this case and previous reported cases in literature, we can conclude that no clear correlation can be established between ricinine blood, plasma or urine levels and the severity of the intoxication.

This cascade affects drug concentrations in the plasma. We investigated the association between lopinavir (LPV) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) plasma concentrations and the values of acute phase inflammation marker C-reactive protein (CRP). Methods: LPV plasma concentrations were prospectively collected in 92 patients hospitalized at our institution. Lopinavir/ritonavir was administered 12 hourly, 800/200 mg on day 1, and 400/100 mg on day 2 until day 5 or 7. HCQ was given at 800 mg, followed by 400 mg after 6, 24 and 48 hours. Hematological, liver, kidney, and inflammation laboratory values were analyzed on the day of drug level determination. Results: The median age of study participants was 59 (range 24 up to 85) years, and 71% were male. The median duration from symptom onset to hospitalization and treatment initiation was 7 days (IQR 4;10) and 8 days (IQR 5;10), respectively. The median LPV trough concentration on day 3 of treatment was 26.5 ug/mL (IQR 18.9;31.5). LPV plasma concentrations positively correlated with CRP values (r=0.37, p<0.001), and were significantly lower when tocilizumab was preadministrated. No correlation was found between HCQ concentrations and CRP values. Conclusions: High LPV plasma concentrations were observed in COVID-19 patients. The ratio of calculated unbound drug fraction to published SARS-CoV2 EC50 values indicated insufficient LPV concentrations in the lung. CRP values significantly correlated with LPV but not HCQ plasma concentrations, implying inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) metabolism by inflammation.",2020-07-07,"Marzolini, C.; Stader, F.; Stoeckle, M.; Franzeck, F.; Egli, A.; Bassetti, S.; Hollinger, A.; Osthoff, M.; Weisser, M.; Gebhard, E.

The aim of this retrospective study was to identify prognostic factors, with a particular focus on the dynamics of serum AFP levels during treatment, in AFPGC patients. Data of patients with pathologically diagnosed primary gastric cancer treated with various modalities electronically collected in the medical management systems of 2 hospitals (ie, Shihezi People's Hospital and Shihezi Hospital) in Shihezi city, northwest China, from January 2007 to October 2018 were reviewed. Patients with AFPGC were identified based on serum AFP levels. Associations of the change in serum AFP levels and clinicopathological parameters with treatment response, including the overall response rate and disease control rate, and outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), were compared among different groups. Of 2354 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer, 96 patients with AFPGC were identified. The objective response rate and disease control rate were significantly higher in patients whose AFP level decreased by ≥50% than in patients whose AFP level decreased by <50% (68.8% vs. 40.6%, and 87.5% vs. 53.1%, respectively, both P < .05). The median OS and PFS were 32.0 (4-74) and 24.0 (1-66) months, respectively, in patients with a ≥50% decline in AFP, and 12.5 (0-69) and 9.0 (0-63) months, respectively, in those with a <50% decline in AFP (both P < .05). On univariate and multivariate analyses, tumor, node, metastasis staging classification stage, liver metastasis, curable surgery, and the decline in the serum AFP level were associated with OS and PFS. A significant decline in the serum AFP level was associated with good treatment response and prognosis in AFPGC.

In response to this crisis, the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief funds programs that serve orphans and vulnerable children affected by HIV and their families. These programs retain case workers, known as activistas, who provide and refer beneficiaries to services to increase beneficiaries' knowledge of their HIV status and to improve retention in care among those living with HIV. To improve program effectiveness, implementing organizations need to understand how different case management attributes affect beneficiary outcomes. We applied fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), based on 119 interviews, to identify the combinations of case management attributes that led to (1) increased knowledge of HIV status, and (2) high percentages of beneficiaries with known HIV status. We identified 6 pathways for the first outcome and 5 pathways for the second outcome. Each pathway demonstrates an alternative combination of conditions that positively influences the outcome and is equally sufficient in achieving the outcome. To improve knowledge of HIV status, programs in a similar context as this study may select any of the identified pathways based on their existing resources and work on ensuring the presence of each of the conditions in the pathway. Overall, based on the presence of some of the factors in multiple pathways, we conclude that to improve knowledge of HIV status it is important that programs implement a formal process to assign cases considering case complexity and existing caseload to reduce overwork; provide activistas with external support such as weekly care team meetings, weekly supervisor meetings, and/or low supervision ratios; hire experienced activistas; provide all activistas with follow-up trainings so they have the tools to address challenging cases; expand the financial resources offered to activistas; and reimburse activistas for work-related expenses.",2020-10-01,"Davis, Allie; Allen, Zola; Nascimento, Nena do; Chapman, Jenifer; Donco, Rotafina; Velthausz, Daan","Global health, science and practice",,,,,,https://doi.org/10.9745/ghsp-d-20-00311; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33008862/,222111328.0

Here we describe the case of an 80-year-old male undergoing peritoneal dialysis with a moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection who developed a purpuric dermatitis and ischemic stroke after successful recovery from his bilateral pneumonia. Erythemato-papular lesions affecting trunk and lower limbs appeared 17 days after the onset of SARS-CoV-2 symptoms. These kind of lesions are an infrequent cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19. The pathology revealed a moderate purpuric dermatitis affecting superficial dermis and corticoesteroids were prescribed achieving complete resolution. Arterial thrombosis affecting cerebellar vermis emerged 30 days after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. It occurred 5 days after withdrawal of antithrombotic prophylaxis that the patient received from his admission until 2 weeks after discharge. He completely recovered from his paresis and continued on his regular antiaggregation therapy. This is the first case report published of a patient with PD with such COVID-19-related complications.

The very special objective of this cohort study is to compare the behaviour of young patients during dental care under CS in two hospitals using different gas distribution systems. METHODS: Young patients were divided into four categories: young child (YC), phobic anxiety (PA), mental disorder (MD), occasional indication (OI). Differences in behaviour scale at various time points according to the sedation system used were established and compared using Mann–Whitney tests. RESULTS: This study showed that there is no difference in behaviour during dental care in YC after sedation. In PA, a significant difference in behaviour is only observed during local anaesthesia (p = 0.024). CONCLUSION: No significant differences detected in children’s behaviour under conscious sedation using different gas administration systems. The delicate stage of local anaesthesia in PA patients can be facilitated with repeated sessions of dental care under conscious sedation.

In addition to its known effects on the cardiovascular system, hypercholesterolemia leads to increased oxidative stress and DNA damage in the bone marrow, which is a non-classical target organ of atherosclerosis. In the present study, we evaluate oxidative stress and assess the effect of genomic instability on cell cycle kinetics in atherosclerotic animals and determine if sildenafil reverses these detrimental effects in bone marrow cells. METHODS: Experiments were performed in male wild-type (WT) and apolipoprotein E knockout mice (apoE(−/−)) (9 weeks of age). apoE(−/−) mice were randomly distributed into the following 2 groups: sildenafil-treated (40 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks, n = 8) and vehicle-treated (n = 8), by oral gavage. After treatment, bone marrow cells were isolated to assess the production of superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide, determine cell cycle kinetics and evaluate the presence of micronucleated cells. RESULTS: Sildenafil treatment reduced the cytoplasmic levels of superoxide anion (~95 % decrease, p < 0.05) and decreased hydrogen peroxide (~30 % decrease, p < 0.05). Moreover, we observed protective effects on the DNA of bone marrow cells, including normal cell cycling, decreased DNA fragmentation and a diminished frequency of micronucleated cells. CONCLUSION: Our data reveal that the excessive production of ROS in atherosclerotic mice overcome the DNA repair pathways in bone marrow cells. The novelty of the present study is that the administration of sildenafil reduced ROS to baseline levels and, consequently, reverted the DNA damage and its outcomes in bone marrow cells.",2016-05-27,"Bernardes, Franciane P.; Batista, Alan T.; Porto, Marcella L.; Vasquez, Elisardo C.; Campagnaro, Bianca P.; Meyrelles, Silvana S.",Lipids Health Dis,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3f8d3e900290496401f7a6557a64255fdb3ebf0e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC4882816.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27229150/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12944-016-0268-6,12265119.0

The most common cause of TCVO is central venous catheters (CVCs) which can induce intravascular scarring or endoluminal obstruction via thrombus formation. AREAS COVERED The Surfacer® System is used to obtain central venous access (CVA) in patients with TCVO by facilitating catheter insertion via the novel Inside-Out® approach. This review summarizes the results of clinical studies to date with the Surfacer System, focusing on the how the procedure is performed, clinical efficacy and safety of the device and patient populations where the device offers substantial clinical benefit. EXPERT OPINION The Surfacer System offers a safe and effective approach to reliably preserve and restore critical upper body vascular access sites.

Little is known about the control measures implemented during this outbreak. OBJECTIVE To describe and evaluate the measures undertaken to control the SARS outbreak. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data were reviewed from standardized surveillance forms from SARS cases (2521 probable cases) and their close contacts observed in Beijing between March 5, 2003, and May 29, 2003. Procedures implemented by health authorities were investigated through review of official documents and discussions with public health officials. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Timeline of major control measures; number of cases and quarantined close contacts and attack rates, with changes in infection control measures, management, and triage of suspected cases; and time lag between illness onset and hospitalization with information dissemination. RESULTS Health care worker training in use of personal protective equipment and management of patients with SARS and establishing fever clinics and designated SARS wards in hospitals predated the steepest decline in cases. During the outbreak, 30 178 persons were quarantined. Among 2195 quarantined close contacts in 5 districts, the attack rate was 6.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3%-7.3%), with a range of 15.4% (95% CI, 11.5%-19.2%) among spouses to 0.36% (95% CI, 0%-0.77%) among work and school contacts. The attack rate among quarantined household members increased with age from 5.0% (95% CI, 0%-10.5%) in children younger than 10 years to 27.6% (95% CI, 18.2%-37.0%) in adults aged 60 to 69 years. Among almost 14 million people screened for fever at the airport, train stations, and roadside checkpoints, only 12 were found to have probable SARS. The national and municipal governments held 13 press conferences about SARS. The time lag between illness onset and hospitalization decreased from a median of 5 to 6 days on or before April 20, 2003, the day the outbreak was announced to the public, to 2 days after April 20 (P<.001).

LoS can vary depending on the patient's ""bed pathway"" - the sequence of transfers between bed types during a hospital stay. In this study, we characterise these pathways, and their impact on predicted hospital bed occupancy. Design We obtained data from University College Hospital (UCH) and the ISARIC4C COVID-19 Clinical Information Network (CO-CIN) on hospitalised patients with COVID-19 who required care in general ward or critical care (CC) beds to determine possible bed pathways and LoS. We developed a discrete-time model to examine the implications of using either bed pathways or only average LoS by bed type to forecast bed occupancy. We compared model-predicted bed occupancy to publicly available bed occupancy data on COVID-19 in England between March and August 2020. Results In both the UCH and CO-CIN datasets, 82% of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 only received care in general ward beds. We identified four other bed pathways, present in both datasets: ""Ward, CC, Ward"", ""Ward, CC"", ""CC"" and ""CC, Ward"". Mean LoS varied by bed type, pathway, and dataset, between 1.78 and 13.53 days. For UCH, we found that using bed pathways improved the accuracy of bed occupancy predictions, while only using an average LoS for each bed type underestimated true bed occupancy. However, using the CO-CIN LoS dataset we were not able to replicate past data on bed occupancy in England, suggesting regional LoS heterogeneities. Conclusions We identified five bed pathways, with substantial variation in LoS by bed type, pathway, and geography. This might be caused by local differences in patient characteristics, clinical care strategies, or resource availability, and suggests that national LoS averages may not be appropriate for local forecasts of bed occupancy for COVID-19.",2021-01-15,"Leclerc, Q.

Therefore, it is essential to develop better strategies to enhance vaccine design and predict parameters that identify susceptible humans. CD4 T cells are a central component of protective immunity to influenza, delivering direct effector function and potentiating responses of other lymphoid cells. Humans have highly diverse influenza-specific CD4 T-cell populations that vary in stimulation history, specificity, and functionality. These complexities constitute a formidable obstacle to predicting immune responses to pandemic strains of influenza and derivation of optimal vaccine strategies.

Rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 is vital to control the spreading of the disease, which however is challenged by limited detection capacity and low detection efficiency in many parts of the world. The pooling test may offer an economical and effective approach to increase virus testing capacity of medical laboratories without requiring more laboratory resources such as laboratory workers, testing reagents and equipment. In this study, the sample pools of 6 and 10 were detected by a real-time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assay targeting ORF1ab and N genes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Each pool consisted of 5 or 9 negative SARS-CoV-2 samples and 1 positive counterpart with varying viral loads. Two different strategies of sample pooling were investigated and the results were compared comprehensively. One approach was to pool viral transport medium (VTM) of the samples in the laboratory, and the other was to pool swab samples during collection process. For swab pooling strategy, qualitative results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA, specific tests of ORF1ab and N genes, remained stable over the different pool sizes. Together, this study demonstrates that the swab pooling strategy may serve as an effective and economical approach for screening SARS-CoV-2 infections in large populations, especially in countries and regions where medical resources are limited during the pandemic and may thus be potential for clinical laboratory applications.

Various forms of RNAs may be used to selectively act on proteins, transcripts, and genes that cannot be targeted by conventional small molecules or proteins. Although development of RNA drugs faces unparalleled challenges, many strategies have been developed to improve RNA metabolic stability and intracellular delivery. A number of RNA drugs have been approved for medical use, including aptamers (e.g., pegaptanib) that mechanistically act on protein target and small interfering RNAs (e.g., patisiran and givosiran) and antisense oligonucleotides (e.g., inotersen and golodirsen) that directly interfere with RNA targets. Furthermore, guide RNAs are essential components of novel gene editing modalities, and mRNA therapeutics are under development for protein replacement therapy or vaccination, including those against unprecedented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, functional RNAs or RNA motifs are highly structured to form binding pockets or clefts that are accessible by small molecules. Many natural, semisynthetic, or synthetic antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, macrolides, oxazolidinones, and phenicols) can directly bind to ribosomal RNAs to achieve the inhibition of bacterial infections. Therefore, there is growing interest in developing RNA-targeted small-molecule drugs amenable to oral administration, and some (e.g., risdiplam and branaplam) have entered clinical trials. Here, we review the pharmacology of novel RNA drugs and RNA-targeted small-molecule medications, with a focus on recent progresses and strategies.

This study assessed the present status of M. pneumoniae infection in Japan and clinical end-points to distinguish children with MR-M. pneumoniae. METHODS: During an outbreak of M. pneumoniae infections in Fukuoka, Japan in 2010–11, a total of 105 children with clinically suspected M. pneumoniae infection were enrolled. M. pneumoniae was analyzed for macrolide resistance in domain V of the 23S rRNA gene. Sixty -five patients with PCR positive for M. pneumoniae were analyzed with regard to clinical symptoms, efficacy of several antimicrobial agents and several laboratory data. RESULTS: Causative pathogens were detected in 81.0% (85 of 105) and M. pneumoniae was identified 61.9% (65 of 105). The resistance rate of M. pneumoniae was 89.2% (58 of 65) in this general pediatric outpatient setting. Patients infected with MR-M. pneumoniae showed longer times to resolution of fever and required frequent changes of the initially prescribed macrolide to another antimicrobial agent. We observed three different genotypes of M. pneumoniae including the rarely reported A2063T mutation (A2063G: 31 strains, A2063T: 27 strains, no mutation: 7 strains). Drug susceptibility testing showed different antimicrobial susceptibility profiles for each genotype. Serum IFN-gamma, IL-6 and IP-10 levels were higher in patients with MR-genotypes than in those infected with no-mutation strains (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Macrolide resistance is more common than previously thought and a small epidemic of rarely reported A2063T mutation was observed in Fukuoka, Japan.

METHODS: New York-Presbyterian Hospital - Weill Cornell Medical Center is an urban, quaternary, academic medical center, a level 1 trauma center, and a regional burn center located in New York City. The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic created a unique challenge for pediatric emergency medicine. As the crisis heightened for adult patients, pediatric emergency services experienced a significant decline in volume and acuity. RESULTS: We offer guidelines to modify physical space, clinical services, staffing models, and the importance of steady leadership. Pediatric emergency space was converted to adult COVID-19 beds, necessitating the repurposing of nonclinical areas for pediatric patients. Efficient clinical pathways were created in collaboration with medical and surgical subspecialists for expedited emergency care of children. We transitioned staffing models to meet the changing clinical demands of the emergency department by both reallocation of pediatric emergency medicine providers to telemedicine and by expanding their clinical care to adult patients. Concentrated communication and receptiveness by hospital and department leadership were fundamental to address the dynamic state of the pandemic and ensure provider wellness. CONCLUSIONS: Modification of physical space, clinical services, staffing models, and the importance of steady leadership enabled us to maintain outstanding clinical care for pediatric patients while maximizing capacity and service for adult COVID-19 patients in the emergency department.",2020,"Fraymovich, Susan; Levine, Deborah A; Platt, Shari L",Pediatr Emerg Care,,#681992,,,,,220846118.0

The Italian government adopted urgent measures to slow its spread. Enforcing compliance with such measures is crucial in order to enhance their effectiveness. Engaging citizens in the COVID-19 preventive process is urgent today both in Italy and around the world. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the role of health engagement in predicting citizens' compliance with health emergency containment measures. METHOD: An online survey was administered between February 28 and March 4, 2020 on a representative sample of 1000 Italians. The questionnaire included a measure of health engagement (Patient Health Engagement Scale), a 5-item Likert scale ranging from 1 to 7, resulting in 4 positions that describe the psychological readiness to be active in one's own health management, and a series of ad hoc items intended to measure citizens' perceived susceptibility and severity of the disease, orientation towards health management, trust in institutional bodies, health habits and food consumption. To investigate the relationship between health engagement and these variables, ANOVA analysis, logistic regression and contingency tables with Pearson's chi-squared analysis have been carried out. RESULTS: Less engaged people show higher levels of perceived susceptibility to the virus and severity of the disease; they are less trustful of scientific and healthcare authorities, they feel less self-effective in managing their own health-both in normal conditions and under stress-and are less prone to cooperate with healthcare professionals. Low levels of health engagement also are associated with a change in the usual purchase behavior. CONCLUSIONS: The Patient Health Engagement model (PHE) provides a useful framework for understanding how people will respond to health threats such as pandemics. Therefore, intervention studies should focus on raising their levels of engagement to increase the effectiveness of educational initiatives intended to promote preventive behaviors.",2020,"Graffigna, Guendalina; Barello, Serena; Savarese, Mariarosaria; Palamenghi, Lorenzo; Castellini, Greta; Bonanomi, Andrea; Lozza, Edoardo",PLoS One,,#760697,,,,,216128393.0

To gain insights into evolutionary forces shaping the CEA gene family we have analysed this gene family in 27 mammalian species including monotreme and marsupial lineages. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis provided convincing evidence that the primordial CEA gene family in mammals consisted of five genes, including the immune inhibitory receptor-encoding CEACAM1 (CEA-related cell adhesion molecule) ancestor. Our analysis of the substitution rates within the nucleotide sequence which codes for the ligand binding domain of CEACAM1 indicates that the selection for diversification is, perhaps, a consequence of the exploitation of CEACAM1 by a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens as their cellular receptor. Depending on the extent of the amplification of an ancestral CEACAM1, the number of CEACAM1-related genes varies considerably between mammalian species from less than five in lagomorphs to more than 100 in bats. In most analysed species, ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) or ITAM-like motif-containing proteins exist which contain Ig-V-like, ligand binding domains closely related to that of CEACAM1. Human CEACAM3 is one such protein which can function as a CEACAM1 decoy receptor in granulocytes by mediating the uptake and destruction of specific bacterial pathogens via its ITAM-like motif. The close relationship between CEACAM1 and its ITAM-encoding relatives appears to be maintained by gene conversion and reciprocal recombination. Surprisingly, secreted CEACAMs resembling immunomodulatory CEACAM1-related trophoblast-specific pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs) found in humans and rodents evolved only in a limited set of mammals. The appearance of PSG-like genes correlates with invasive trophoblast growth in these species.

We observed a positively charged canyon on the surface of the N-NTD that might serve as a putative RNA binding site similarly to other coronaviruses. The subsequent NMR titrations using single-stranded and double-stranded RNA revealed a much more extensive U-shaped RNA-binding cleft lined with regularly distributed arginines and lysines.

With the economy at a standstill, the Palestinian governing authority has limited financial resources to (re)build key sanitation, hygiene, waste treatment and water supply infrastructure. These (infrastructural) inadequacies, while already a public health concern before the onset of the pandemic, now renders Gaza particularly vulnerable to the spread of viruses and diseases. Additionally, the limited movement of goods because of the siege has led to an acute shortage of medical supplies and equipment that are essential for combating a pandemic. Nonetheless, the COVID-19 outbreak is also “unique” in that it presents Gaza with a crisis that has little to do with the hostilities that define the politics of Israel-Palestine. Yet, the potential of a widespread outbreak also lays bare to the development challenges that Gaza faces as a result of the conflict.

Presently, several classes of antimalarial drugs are available in market, but the issues of toxicity, lower efficacy and the resistance by malarial parasites have decreased their overall therapeutic indices. Thus, the search for new promising antimalarials continues, however, the battle against malaria is far from over. Ferroquine is a derivative of chloroquine with antimalarial properties. It is the most successful of the chloroquine derivatives. Not only ferroquine, but also its derivatives have shown promising potential as antimalarials of clinical interest. Presently, much research is dedicated to the development of ferroquine derivatives as safe alternatives to antimalarial chemotherapy. The present article describes the structural, chemical and biological features of ferroquine. Several classes of ferroquine derivatives including hydroxyferroquines, trioxaferroquines, chloroquine-bridged ferrocenophanes, thiosemicarbazone derivatives, ferrocene dual conjugates, 4-N-substituted derivatives, and others have been discussed. Besides, the mechanism of action of ferroquine has been discussed. A careful observation has been made into pharmacologically significant ferroquine derivatives with better or equal therapeutic effects to that of chloroquine and ferroquine. A brief discussion of the toxicities of ferroquine derivatives has been made.

Previously, most software developers worked in physical offices and new hires onboarded to their teams in the physical office, following a standard onboarding process. However, when companies transitioned employees to work from home due to the pandemic, there was little time to no time to develop new onboarding procedures. In this paper, we present a survey of 267 new hires at Microsoft that onboarded to software development teams during the pandemic. We explored their remote onboarding process, including the challenges that the new hires encountered and their social connectedness with their teams. We found that most developers onboarded remotely and never had an opportunity to meet their teammates in person. This leads to one of the biggest challenges faced by these new hires, building a strong social connection with their team.

C3H mice suffered severe lung infection with significant body weight reduction and died within 7 days after intranasal infection. Infectious viruses were isolated mainly from the lungs and trachea. Histopathological examination revealed interstitial pneumonia with monocytes infiltration. Following repeated intranasal infection, mice developed antibodies to particular structural and non-structural proteins of PRV.

However, in many countries a ""Phase-2"" is approaching and many activities will re-open soon, although with some differences depending on the severity of the outbreak experienced and SARS-COV-2 estimated diffusion in the general population. At the present, possible relapses of the epidemic cannot be excluded until effective vaccines or immunoprophylaxis with human recombinant antibodies will be properly set up and commercialized. COVD-19-related quarantines have triggered serious social challenges, so that decision makers are concerned about the risk of wasting all the sacrifices imposed to the people in these months of quarantine. The availability of possible early predictive indicators of future epidemic relapses would be very useful for public health purposes, and could potentially prevent the suspension of entire national economic systems. On 16 March, a Position Paper launched by the Italian Society of Environmental Medicine (SIMA) hypothesized for the first time a possible link between the dramatic impact of COVID-19 outbreak in Northern Italy and the high concentrations of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) that characterize this area, along with its well-known specific climatic conditions. Thereafter, a survey carried out in the U.S. by the Harvard School of Public Health suggested a strong association between increases in particulate matter concentration and mortality rates due to COVID-19. The presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA on the particulate matter of Bergamo, which is not far from Milan and represents the epicenter of the Italian epidemic, seems to confirm (at least in case of atmospheric stability and high PM concentrations, as it usually occurs in Northern Italy) that the virus can create clusters with the particles and be carried and detected on PM10. Although no assumptions can be made concerning the link between this first experimental finding and COVID-19 outbreak progression or severity, the presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA on PM10 of outdoor air samples in any city of the world could represent a potential early indicator of COVID-19 diffusion. Searching for the viral genome on particulate matter could therefore be explored among the possible strategies for adopting all the necessary preventive measures before future epidemics start.",2020,"Setti, Leonardo; Passarini, Fabrizio; De Gennaro, Gianluigi; Barbieri, Pierluigi; Pallavicini, Alberto; Ruscio, Maurizio; Piscitelli, Prisco; Colao, Annamaria; Miani, Alessandro",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,#32344853,,,,,216647146.0

Simultaneously, the data and insights that can inform consumer attitudes and behaviors often reside outside of firms' direct control. Consciously incorporating these interdependent factors into firms' decision-making is essential for adaptability and sustainable profitability. Building on the “outside-in” perspective, we propose that firm strategies should be informed through the lens of the marketing ecosystem that considers the interrelated and dynamic megatrends. By leveraging advances in data and technology, firms can sense-make the marketplace by extracting insights from massive amounts of diverse consumer data with modern-day analytics. By mapping out the megatrends with marketing analytics, firms can 1) more accurately predict consumers' changing preferences and formulate appropriate strategies to engage with them; and 2) become more market-adaptable and competitive in the present and the future. To deliver sustainably compelling value to customers, firms should adopt an ecosystem mindset and cooperate with various stakeholders. A broad-thinking, agile, and humble firm culture can enable the development of more robust outside-in capabilities.

As transmission intensifies in other countries, the interplay between age, contact patterns, social distancing, susceptibility to infection, and COVID-19 dynamics remains unclear. To answer these questions, we analyze contact survey data for Wuhan and Shanghai before and during the outbreak and contact-tracing information from Hunan province. Daily contacts were reduced seven- to eightfold during the COVID-19 social distancing period, with most interactions restricted to the household. We find that children 0 to 14 years of age are less susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection than adults 15 to 64 years of age (odds ratio 0.34, 95% confidence interval 0.24 to 0.49), whereas individuals more than 65 years of age are more susceptible to infection (odds ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.12 to 1.92).

In Europe, Italy has faced this novel disease entity (named novel coronavirus disease [COVID-19]) first and severely. COVID-19 represents a significant hurdle for public health services and a potential harm for patients with cancer. The Collegio Italiano dei Primari Oncologi Medici (CIPOMO) is an Italian association of head physicians in oncology departments, which promotes working and research activities in oncology on a national basis. In the midst of the epidemic in Italy, the CIPOMO promoted a national survey aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on clinical activity of oncologists and the implementation of containment measures of COVID-19 diffusion. Overall, 122 head physicians participated in this survey, with a homogeneous distribution on the national territory. Results show that the following measures for oncologic patients have been promptly implemented through the whole country: use of protective devices, triage of patients accessing the hospital, delay of non-urgent visits and use of telemedicine. Results of this survey suggest that Italian oncology departments have promptly set a proactive approach to the actual emergency. Oncologists need to preserve the continuum of care of patients, as the benefit of ensuring a well-delivered anti-cancer treatment plan outweighs the risk of COVID-19 infection.

The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and angiotensin-converting enzymes have received a good deal of attention as possible pathways involved in 2019-nCoV pathogenesis. As the experiments seeking to find potential medications acting on these pathways are being conducted in the early phases, having an ecological worldview on the relationship between the prevalence of COVID-19 disease and the genetic differences in the genes involved in the RAS system could be valuable for the field. In this regard, we conducted a meta-analysis study of the prevalence of ACE (I/D) genotype in countries most affected by the COVID-19. In the meta-analysis, 48,758 healthy subjects from 30 different countries were evaluated in 116 studies, using the Comprehensive Meta-analysis software. The I/D allele frequency ratio was pooled by a random-effect model. The COVID-19 prevalence data of death and recovery rates were evaluated as the latitudes for the meta-regression analysis. Our results demonstrated that with the increase of the I/D allele frequency ratio, the recovery rate significantly increased (point estimate: 0.48, CI 95%: 0.05-0.91, p = 0.027). However, there was no significant difference in the case of death rate (point estimate: 1.74, CI 95%: 4.5-1.04, p = 0.22).

The microbicidal effect is mainly due to silver ions, which have a wide antibacterial spectrum. Furthermore, the development of multidrug-resistant bacteria, as in the case of antibiotics, is less likely. Silver ions bind to halide ions, such as chloride, and precipitate; therefore, when used directly, their microbicidal activity is shortened. To overcome this issue, silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) have been recently synthesized and frequently used as microbicidal agents that release silver ions from particle surface. Depending on the specific surface area of the nanoparticles, silver ions are released with high efficiency. In addition to their bactericidal activity, small Ag NPs (<10 nm in diameter) affect viruses although the microbicidal effect of silver mass is weak. Because of their characteristics, Ag NPs are useful countermeasures against infectious diseases, which constitute a major issue in the medical field. Thus, medical tools coated with Ag NPs are being developed.

Its pathogen, rabies virus (RABV), can utilize its viral proteins, such as the nucleoprotein and phosphorylation protein, to subvert the host innate immune system. For a long time, the large (L) protein was believed to be essential for RABV transcription and replication, but its role in viral pathogenicity and immune evasion was not known. Recent studies have found that the conserved K-D-K-E tetrad motif in the L protein is related to the methyltransferase (MTase) activity in the viral mRNA process. In the present study, a series of RABV mutations in this motif was constructed with the recombinant CVS-B2c (rB2c) virus. Two of these mutants, rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A, were found to be stable and displayed an attenuated phenotype in both in vitro growth and in vivo pathogenicity in adult and suckling mice. Further studies demonstrated that these two mutants were more sensitive to the expression of the interferon-stimulated gene product IFIT2 than the parent virus. Taken together, our results suggest that K1685 and K1829 in the L protein play important roles in pathogenicity and immune evasion during RABV infection. IMPORTANCE Rabies continues to present a public health threat in most areas of the world, especially in the developing countries of Asia and Africa. The pathogenic mechanisms for rabies are not well understood. In the present study, it was found that the recombinant rabies viruses rB2c-K1685A and rB2c-K1829A, carrying mutations at the predicted MTase catalytic sites in the L protein, were highly attenuated both in vitro and in vivo. Further studies showed that these mutants were more sensitive to the expression of the interferon-stimulated gene product IFIT2 than the parent virus. These findings improve our understanding of rabies pathogenesis, which may help in developing potential therapeutics and an avirulent rabies vaccine.",2016,"Tian, Dayong; Luo, Zhaochen; Zhou, Ming; Li, Mingming; Yu, Lan; Wang, Chong; Yuan, Jiaolong; Li, Fang; Tian, Bin; Sui, Baokun; Chen, Huanchun; Fu, Zhen F; Zhao, Ling",Journal of virology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02050-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26468538/,3867219.0

There is increasing evidence that chloroquine not only induces phagocytosis but regulates vascular tone. Few reports investigating the effect of chloroquine on vascular responsiveness of coronary arteries have been made. In this study, we examined how chloroquine affected endothelium-dependent relaxation in coronary arteries under normal and diabetic conditions. Experimental Approach: We isolated coronary arteries from mice and examined endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR). Human coronary endothelial cells and mouse coronary endothelial cells isolated from control and diabetic mouse (TALLYHO/Jng [TH] mice, a spontaneous type 2 diabetic mouse model) were used for the molecular biological or cytosolic NO and Ca2+measurements. Key Results: Chloroquine inhibited endothelium-derived NO-dependent relaxation but had negligible effect on endothelium-derived hyperpolarization (EDH)-dependent relaxation in coronary arteries of control mice. Chloroquine significantly decreased NO production in control human coronary endothelial cells partly by phosphorylating eNOSThr495(an inhibitory phosphorylation site of eNOS) and attenuating the rise of cytosolic Ca2+concentration after stimulation. EDR was significantly inhibited in diabetic mice in comparison to control mice. Interestingly, chloroquine enhanced EDR in diabetic coronary arteries by, specifically, increasing EDH-dependent relaxation due partly to its augmenting effect on gap junction activity in diabetic mouse coronary endothelial cells. Conclusions and Implications: These data indicate that chloroquine affects vascular relaxation differently under normal and diabetic conditions. Therefore, the patients' health condition such as coronary macrovascular or microvascular disease, with or without diabetes, must be taken account into the consideration when selecting chloroquine for the treatment of malaria.",2020,"Zhang, Qian; Tsuji-Hosokawa, Atsumi; Willson, Conor; Watanabe, Makiko; Si, Rui; Lai, Ning; Wang, Ziyi; Yuan, Jason X.-J.; Wang, Jian; Makino, Ayako",Br.

The roles of STAT6 signal in allergy, immune regulation, tumorigenesis, and renal fibrosis have been documented. However, the function and mechanism of STAT6 signal in sympathetic overactivation-induced cardiac fibrosis have not been fully elucidated. This study explores the novel role of STAT6 signal in isoproterenol (ISO)–induced cardiac fibrosis through the regulation of inflammatory response and the differentiation of macrophages from immature myeloid cells. The expression levels of STAT6, β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR), and inflammatory factors [interleukin α (IL-1α), IL-6, IL-18, and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)] in CD11b(+) myeloid cells were analyzed with a microarray study. The levels of IL-6 and TGF-β1 in the CD11b(+) myeloid cells–derived macrophages were detected with reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). STAT6–knockout (KO) and WT mice were used to establish a murine cardiac fibrosis model by ISO injection. Cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from the hearts of newborn STAT6-KO and WT mice, and STAT6 expression was measured by Western blotting and RT-PCR after ISO stimulation, while α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression was detected by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry staining. Cardiac function and pathological characteristics were examined by echocardiography and immunohistochemistry staining, respectively. Immunohistochemistry staining with anti-CD11b was performed to detect the infiltration of CD11b(+) myeloid cells in heart tissue. Flow cytometry analysis was used to measure the percentages of CD11b(+) myeloid cells and CD11b(+)Ly6C(+) macrophages in the peripheral blood. The results showed that STAT6 was highly expressed in CD11b(+) myeloid cells located in injured hearts, and STAT6 expression in cardiac fibroblasts was down-regulated after ISO treatment. STAT6 deficiency further aggravated ISO-induced increased expression of α-SMA in cardiac fibroblasts, myocardial fibrosis, and cardiac dysfunction. The activation of ISO/β1-AR signal aggravated cardiac inflammatory infiltration, promoted CD11b(+) myeloid cell mobilization, and enhanced CD11b(+)Ly6C(+/low) macrophage differentiation, which was further exacerbated by STAT6 deficiency. Furthermore, β1-AR mRNA expression significantly increased in splenic CD11b(+) myeloid cells compared to their bone marrow–derived controls, and STAT6 deficiency promoted β1-AR expression in an MI-induced sensitive cardiac fibrosis mouse model. The spleen-derived CD11b(+) myeloid cells of STAT6-KO mice produced more IL-1α, IL-18, and TGF-β than their WT counterparts. Taken together, these results suggest that STAT6 signal plays a critical role in ISO-induced β1-AR overactivation and systemic inflammatory cascades, contributing to cardiac fibrogenesis. STAT6 should be a promising cardioprotective target against myocardial fibrosis and heart failure after β1-AR overactivation–induced myocardial injury.",2020-10-22,"Zhang, Weiwei; Zhu, Baoling; Ding, Suling; Wang, Xiangfei; Wu, Jian; Zhu, Xiaowei; Zou, Yunzeng; Ge, Junbo; Tong, Minghong; Yang, Xiangdong",Front Physiol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/715d325d2d41ca0d5e59c0389a5759915529c389.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7642801.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7642801/,

However, there is a scarcity of comparative studies on how modalities of conferencing programs impact health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to compare laptop-based with smartphone-based videoconferencing programs on nursing home residents' perceptions of loneliness, depressive symptoms and social support. METHODS This retrospective secondary analysis used data from two previous studies on the effectiveness of videoconferencing programs (laptop-based and smartphone-based) to improve outcomes of loneliness, depressive symptoms and social support (type and source) among nursing home residents. Generalised estimating equations compared differences from baseline measures with measures at 1 and 3 months between the two groups with and without adjusting for the effects of confounding variables. RESULTS With the exception of age, there were no differences in demographics between participants in the laptop and smartphone groups. Neither changes from baseline in mean scores for loneliness nor depressive symptoms differed between groups. However, changes in mean scores from baseline between groups were significantly greater in the smartphone-based group compared with the laptop-based group for three types of social support: informational and appraisal at 1 and 3 months; and emotional at 3 months. Changes from baseline in mean scores for social support from friends (at 1 and 3 months) and other sources (at 3 months) were also significantly greater for the smartphone group compared with the laptop group. DISCUSSION The two modalities of videoconferencing did not differ in effects on depressive symptoms or loneliness.

The items in the questionnaire were based on clinical experience, relevant literature review and discussion with peers. A list of issues that were deemed as essential components of the experience of the pandemic relevant to physicians was arrived at. Thereafter these issues were operationalized into question form and hosted on the google forms platform. The link to this questionnaire was circulated by the authors among their peer groups in the month of April 2020. Results We received 295 responses and 3 were unusable. Most of the responses were from India, the United States of America, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. About 60% of the respondents identified themselves as frontline and had a decade of clinical experience. Most respondents reported being anxious due to the pandemic and also observed the same in their peers and families. A majority also observed changes in behaviour in self and others and advanced a variety of reasons and concerns. A sense of duty was the most commonly employed coping mechanism. Conclusion Physicians are not immune from information and misinformation, or cues in the environment. Behavioural choices are not always predicted by knowledge but by a combination of knowledge, emotional state, personality and environment.

200448,gs4tmou0,,WHO,Familiarity with humans affect dogs' tendencies to follow human majority groups,,,,unk,"Recently, copying others' behaviour has attracted attention among researchers. It aids individuals in reducing uncertainty about the knowledge of the environment and helps them in acquiring an adaptive behaviour at a lower cost than by learning it by themselves. Among the copying strategies, conformity, which is the copying of behavioural decisions presented by the majority, has been well studied and reported in many animals, including humans. The previous study showed that dogs did not conform to their multiple conspecific individuals; however, dogs have evolved to increase their adaptability while living with humans, and it is plausible that dogs have selected appropriate behaviour according to the behaviour of humans. Therefore, we investigated which factors influenced the choice of dogs in a situation where they have to choose one of two numerically unbalanced human groups. The results showed that the dogs followed the human majority group under certain conditions, depending on the familiarity with the human demonstrators. These results are important in considering the significance of groups for dogs and the factors of group formation, and will also provide a clue as to how dogs have penetrated into human society.",2020,"Nagasawa, Miho; Mogi, Kazutaka; Ohtsuki, Hisashi; Kikusui, Takefumi",Sci Rep,,#32346129,,,,,216559973.0

Additional measures to protect patients and healthcare workers from COVID-19 that may be transmitted by the inhalation sedation system are discussed. The authors recommend minimal use of a N2O system during inhalation sedation in dentistry. In case of need, the practitioners should have more than one scavenger kit and nasal masks for each N2O/O2 mixer.

Environmental disasters, natural and human-made activities raise risk factors that indirectly facilitate infectious disease outbreaks. Subsequently, changes in habitat, displaced populations, and environmental stresses that affect the survival of species are amplified over time. The recurrence and spread of vector-borne (e.g., mosquito, tick, aphid) human, animal, and plant pathogens to new geographic locations are also influenced by climate change. The distribution and range of humans, agricultural animals and plants, wildlife and native plants, as well as vectors, parasites, and microbes that cause neglected diseases of the tropics as well as other global regions are also impacted. In addition, genomic sequencing can now be applied to detect signatures of infectious pathogens as they move into new regions. Molecular detection assays complement metagenomic sequencing to help us understand the microbial community found within the microbiomes of hosts and vectors, and help us uncover mechanistic relationships between climate variability and pathogen transmission. Our understanding of, and responses to, such complex dynamics and their impacts can be enhanced through effective, multi-sectoral One Health engagement coupled with applications of both traditional and novel technologies.

Zika virus is a Flavivirus, and is transmitted to humans by Aedes species mosquitoes. In May 2015, the World Health Organization reported the first locally acquired transmission of ZIKV in Brazil, the first case in the Western Hemisphere. There have also been reports of increased incidence of microcephaly and other neurologic complications associated with ZIKV infection, as well as a 20-fold increase in the incidence of Guillain-Barre Syndrome during ZIKV outbreaks. In light of the clusters of microcephaly and neurologic manifestations in areas of ZIKV transmission, the World Health Organization declared ZIKV and associated complications an international public health emergency. The clinical presentations of ZIKV disease resemble many common infections, making the diagnosis of ZIKV disease a clinical challenge. Patients with ZIKV infection may have other coinfections that can distract clinicians from suspecting ZIKV disease in their patients. Complications from ZIKV, although uncommon, may be severe. Therefore, it is important for health care providers to remain alert and up to date in the efforts to control this emerging global health crisis. It is critical for physicians and other providers to know the growing list of countries and territories on the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention list of nations with endemic ZIKV disease and to work closely with local health departments to prevent spread.

This study aimed to determine the association between skeletal muscle depletion and clinical outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: One hundred and sixteen patients with severe COVID-19 who underwent chest computed tomography (CT) scan on admission were included in this multicentre, retrospective study. Paraspinal muscle index (PMI) and radiodensity (PMD) were measured using CT images. The primary composite outcome was the occurrence of critical illness (respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, shock, or intensive care unit admission) or death, and the secondary outcomes were the duration of viral shedding and pulmonary fibrosis in the early rehabilitation phase. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the associations. RESULTS: The primary composite outcome occurred in 48 (41.4%) patients, who were older and had lower PMD (both P < 0.05). Higher PMD was associated with reduced risk of critical illness or death in a fully adjusted model overall (OR per SD increment: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.80-0.95; P = 0.002) and in female patients (OR per SD increment: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.56-0.91; P = 0.006), although the effect was not statistically significant in male patients (P = 0.202). Higher PMD (HR per SD increment: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02-1.14; P = 0.008) was associated with shorter duration of viral shedding among female survivors. However, no significant association was found between PMD and pulmonary fibrosis in the early rehabilitation phase, or between PMI and any outcome in both men and women.

To date, its effectiveness in cancer clinical trials has been minimal. Some suggestions are provided for that disappointment and recent citations are provided that support the idea that G3139 may be effective at clearing viral infections, specifically HIV. At the time G3139 was conceived as an anti-cancer drug candidate, it was viewed optimistically because Bcl-2 was widely believed to be the most important protein blocking p53-dependent apoptosis caused by internal stress. Since that time, we have learnt that Bcl-2 is not the only protein that inhibits apoptosis and that p53 itself is frequently malfunctioning in tumors. Thus, the anti-cancer utility of suppressing Bcl-2 in cancer cells is limited. Moreover, Bcl-2 has a role in halting the cell cycle (though p27), which may slow down tumor growth; and Bcl-2 even has pro-apoptotic roles in the execution of apoptosis initiated by external death signals (via Fas/CD95 and caspase 3). Overall, in the clinical setting, G3139 usually has statistically significant but medically unimportant benefit. These results have greatly diminished the enthusiasm for the drug especially when the side effects are considered. Specifically, the unmethylated CpG ODN (and/or the phosphorothioate group) activates the immune system, but this potentially important anti-cancer effect is lost when the immune cells undergo premature apoptosis apparently because their Bcl-2 levels have been lowered by the antisense effect of G3139.

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of COVID-19 on orthopaedic practice and training in the UK. METHODS: Surgeons throughout UK hospitals were asked to complete an electronic survey relating to orthopaedic practice and training in their hospital. The nationwide survey was conducted during the first peak of COVID-19 cases in the UK between 20 March 2020 and 20 April 2020. RESULTS: All 202 UK participants reported disruption to their daily practice. 91% reported all elective operating had been cancelled and trauma continued as normal in only 24% of cases. 70% reported disruption to trauma operating. Elective clinic capacity significantly reduced with no elective clinics running as normal. 55% reported their elective clinics completely cancelled, whilst 38% reported elective clinics running at a reduced capacity, with non-urgent appointments postponed. Only 9% of fracture clinics ran as normal, and 69% had a reduced service. 67% reported teaching and study leave cancelled. Significantly, 69% of participants felt the pandemic would result in a delay to completion of registrar training programmes. CONCLUSION: This is the first nationwide survey assessing the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 on UK orthopaedic practice and training, during the peak of the pandemic. It highlights the scale of the challenge ahead for the specialty, including during the recovery phase and post-recovery phase of the pandemic.",2020,"Khan, Hiba; Williamson, Mike; Trompeter, Alex",Eur. j. orthop. surg. traumatol,,#670743,,,,,220798085.0

Atherosclerotic changes, the primary pathological substrate for CVD, are closely related to hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, the treatment of hypercholesterolemia is a key therapeutic strategy for CVD management. Statins, as the gold standard in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, have shown enhanced cardiac outcomes in many randomized clinical trials. However, often despite the maximum allowed and tolerated dosage of statins, we are not able to reach the target cholesterol levels, and thus patients persist at an increased cardiovascular risk. Recently, most of the large clinical studies in the field of preventive cardiology have focused on proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) and its activity regulation. PCSK9 plays an essential role in the metabolism of LDL particles by inhibiting LDL receptor recirculation to the cell surface. Recent studies have shown that inhibition of PCSK9 by the administration of monoclonal antibodies is capable of significantly reducing LDL levels (up to an additional 60%) as well as reducing the incidence of CVD. However, this treatment procedure of administering the anti-PCSK9 antibodies, most frequently two times a month, has its limitations in terms of time, patient adherence, and nevertheless cost. Administration of active vaccination instead of passive immunization with anti-PCSK9 antibodies may be an effective way of controlling blood cholesterol levels. However, clinical data, as well as human testing, are still inadequate.

Identification of suitable targets within the inflammatory pathways for devising the therapeutic strategies useful in controlling the prognosis of COVID-19 finds a special mention in this article. However, antibody-dependent enhancement is the key aspect to consider before testing any drug/compound for therapeutic purposes.

In humans, a new class of direct oral acting anticoagulants (DOAC) appear as effective as heparin, while eliminating the need for daily injections. Our study in horses evaluated apixaban, a newly approved DOAC for human thromboprophylaxis targeting activated factor X (Xa). Our goals were to: (1) Determine pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of apixaban after oral (PO) and intravenous (IV) administration in horses; (2) Detect any inhibitory effects of apixaban on ex vivo Equid herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1)-induced platelet activation, and (3) Compare an anti-Xa bioactivity assay with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) for measuring apixaban concentrations. In a blinded placebo-controlled cross-over study, five horses received a single dose (0.2 mg/kg) of apixaban or placebo PO or IV. Blood was collected before and at 3 (IV) or 15 (PO) min, 30 and 45 min, and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after dosing for measuring apixaban UPLC-MS concentrations and anti-Xa activity. Pharmacodynamic response was measured in a dilute prothrombin time (dPT) assay. Flow cytometric EHV-1-induced platelet P-selectin expression and clinical pathologic safety testing were performed at baseline, 2 and 24 h and baseline and 24 h, respectively. We found no detectable apixaban in plasma PO administration. After IV administration, plasma apixaban levels followed a two-compartment model, with concentrations peaking at 3 min and decreasing to undetectable levels by 8 h. The elimination half-life was 1.3 ± 0.2 h, with high protein binding (92-99%). The dPT showed no relationship to apixaban UPLC-MS concentration and apixaban did not inhibit EHV-1-induced platelet activation after IV dosing. Apixaban anti-Xa activity showed excellent correlation to UPLC-MS (r 2 = 0.9997).

Eight- to 12-week-old virgin female CD1 mice (n = 22) were paired overnight with vasectomized males and successfully mated, indicated by the presence of a vaginal plug. These dams underwent embryo transfer 3 days later with embryos obtained from superovulated 4-week-old F1 (C57BL/6 × CBA) females. Non-invasive vaginal lavage was conducted immediately before transfer. Dams were killed 6 days after transfer and the uterus collected for histological analysis. Embryo implantation rate in mice was 96% when cytological analysis of the lavage samples signified dioestrus (n = 6), whereas the implantation rate was <15% (n = 16) when cytology signified other stages of oestrous.

The need for rapid treatment of this disease entity is without question; however, the best method for treatment is still undetermined. Here, we present our results using the stent-in-stent technique, without coiling, for these patients and propose that it is a viable treatment strategy. METHODS We identified in our local database for neurointerventional therapy, between 1st October 2000 and 1st January 2014, 93 patients with potential subarachnoid haemorrhage secondary to vertebrobasilar pathology. After review of the clinical notes and imaging, 15 were found to have presented with subarachnoid haemorrhage and treated with stents alone. All dissections were spontaneous with no history of preceding trauma. The ages ranged between 46 and 71 years (mean 61 years). RESULTS All patients presented with Fischer grade 4 SAH and had a visible pseudoaneurysm. The pre-operative GCS varied with two patients scoring 3, one patient scoring 6 and the remaining 12 patients scoring 8 or above. All cases were subjected to stent-in-stent treatment alone. We did not experience any intra-procedural complications. In our series, eight patients had full recovery with a Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of 5, three had moderate disability (GOS 4), one had severe disability (GOS 3), and three patents died, one patient from stent thrombosis or re-bleeding and two from their initial SAH. CONCLUSION The stent-in-stent technique represents a viable reconstructive endovascular surgical technique with a low risk of intra-procedural complication and post-operative repeat haemorrhage.",2015,"Bhogal, Pervinder; Brouwer, Patrick A; Söderqvist, Åsa Kuntze; Ohlsson, Marcus; Andersson, Tommy; Holmin, Staffan; Söderman, Michael",Neuroradiology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-015-1505-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25740790/,19328392.0

As governments begin to relax restrictions on public life there is a need to understand the potential impact that reopening schools may have on transmission. Methods We used data provided by the UK Department for Education to construct a network of English schools, connected through pairs of pupils resident at the same address. We used the network to evaluate the potential for transmission between schools, and for long range propagation across the network, under different reopening scenarios. Results Amongst the options evaluated we found that reopening only Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 (4-6 and 10-11 year olds) resulted in the lowest risk of transmission between schools, with outbreaks within a single school unlikely to result in outbreaks in adjacent schools in the network. The additional reopening of Years 10 and 12 (14-15 and 16-17 year olds) resulted in an increase in the risk of transmission between schools comparable to reopening all primary school years (4-11 year olds). However, the majority of schools presented low risk of initiating widespread transmission through the school system. Reopening all secondary school years (11-18 year olds) resulted in large potential outbreak clusters putting up to 50% of households connected to schools at risk of infection if sustained transmission within schools was possible. Conclusions Reopening secondary school years is likely to have a greater impact on community transmission than reopening primary schools in England. Keeping transmission within schools limited is essential for reducing the risk of large outbreaks amongst school-aged children and their household members.",2020-08-24,"Munday, J.

We aimed to evaluate factors associated with psychological distress among the predominantly general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and World Health Organization COVID-19 databases (Dec 2019–15 July 2020). We included cross-sectional studies that reported factors associated with psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes were self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression. Random-effects models were used to pool odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (#CRD42020186735). FINDINGS: We included 68 studies comprising 288,830 participants from 19 countries. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was 33% (95% CI: 28%-39%) and 30% (26%-36%). Women versus men (OR: 1.48 [95% CI: 1.29–1.71; I(2) = 90.8%]), younger versus older (< versus ≥35 years) adults (1.20 [1.13–1.26]; I(2) = 91.7%), living in rural versus urban areas (1.13 [1.00–1.29]; I(2) = 82.9%), lower versus higher socioeconomic status (e.g. lower versus higher income: 1.45 [1.24–1.69; I(2) = 82.3%]) were associated with higher anxiety odds. These factors (except for residential area) were also associated with higher depression odds. Furthermore, higher COVID-19 infection risk (suspected/confirmed cases, living in hard-hit areas, having pre-existing physical or mental conditions) and longer media exposure were associated with higher odds of anxiety and depression.

These values were then related to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of a number of equine pathogenic bacteria to determine the duration of therapeutic serum concentrations of the aminoglycosides in the horse. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the data using neomycin as the example revealed a mean (± sd) peak serum concentration of 23.2 ± 10.2 μg/ml present at 30 mins, and at 8 h the serum concentration was 2.8 ± 0.8 μg/ml. From the pharmacological analysis of concentration‐time data it was shown that neomycin was very rapidly absorbed from the im injection site, with an absorption half‐time of 0.16 ± 0.05 and was well absorbed (systemic availability was 73.7 ± 26.9 per cent). A peak tissue level, which represented 40 per cent of the amount of drug in the body, was obtained at 32 mins after injection of the drug. At 8 h, the fractions of the dose in the central and peripheral compartments of the model were 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively, and 96 per cent was the cumulative amount eliminated up to that time. Based on the MIC values of the majority of isolates of Corynebacterium equi, and only a few isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus equi, one would expect a serum concentration of more than 2 μg neomycin/ml up to 8 h following im dosage (10 mg/kg) to be therapeutically effective.",2010-04-23,"BAGGOT, J.

Although Hubei province is the epicenter of China, little is known about epidemiological and clinical features of COVID-19 in other areas in Hubei province around Wuhan. In addition, the virological data, particularly the factors associated with viral shedding of COVID-19 has not been well described. OBJECTIVE: To describe the epidemiological and clinical features of patients with COVID-19 in Tianmen city, and identify risk factors associated with prolonged viral shedding of COVID-19. METHODS: Inpatients with COVID-19 admitted before February 9, 2020 were included. Characteristics were compared between patients with early and late viral RNA shedding. Multivariate cox regression model was used to investigate variables associated with prolonged viral shedding. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-three patients were included. About 8.2% patients were categorized as critical degree of severity. All patients received antiviral therapy, with arbidol and interferon being the commonest. About 38.3% and 16.9% patients were treated with corticosteroid and immunoglobulin, respectively. Time from onset to admission (HR = 0.829, P < 0.001), and administration of corticosteroid (HR = 0.496, P = 0.002), arbidol (HR = 2.605, P = 0.008) and oseltamivir (HR = 0.416, P < 0.001) were independently associated with duration of viral shedding. CONCLUSION: Symptoms of patients from Tianmen are relatively mild. Treatment should be started as early as possible, but corticosteroid and oseltamivir should be initiated with caution. In addition, clinical trials on arbidol should be conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness.",2020,"Hu, Fuying; Yin, Gang; Chen, Youping; Song, Jiangqin; Ye, Maosong; Liu, Jie; Chen, Cuicui; Song, Yuanlin; Tang, Xinjun; Zhang, Yong",Clin Respir J,,#693257,,,,,220976201.0

The substitution rate of the R protein is close to the average of the SARS-CoV genome. The functional domains in all NSPs of the R protein give different phylogenetic results that suggest their different mutation rate under selective pressure. Eleven highly conserved regions in RdRp and twelve cleavage sites by 3CLP (chymotrypsin-like protein) have been identified as potential drug targets.

The low incidence of vascular complications in GCK-MODY makes it a natural paradigm for interrogating molecular mechanisms promoting vascular health under prolonged hyperglycemia. Clinical rate of misdiagnosis has remained high, and a reliable serum lipid biomarker that precedes genetic screening can facilitate correct diagnosis and treatment. Herein, we comprehensively quantitated 565 serum lipids from 25 classes in 105 subjects (42 nondiabetic controls, 30 GC K-MODY patients, 33 drug-naïve, and newly-onset T2D patients). At false-discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, several phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and plasmalogen PCs were specifically increased in GCK-MODY, while triacylglycerols (TAGs) and diacylglycerols (DAGs) were reduced. Correlation matrices between lipids uncovered coregulation between plasmalogen PCs (PCps) and glycerolipid precursors was distinctly enhanced in GCK-MODY compared to T2D. Strengthened positive correlations between serum PCps and circulating HDLs was specifically observed in hyperglycemic subjects (i.e. T2D and GCK-MODY) compared to normglycemic controls, suggesting that HDL-PCps may elicit distinct physiological effects under hyperglycemia. Amongst GCK-MODY patients, individuals harboring variants of GCK mutations with elevated PCps also exhibited higher HDLs. Isolated HDLs displayed localized increases (p < 0.05) in very-long-chain PUFA-PCs and PCps in GCK-MODY. Protein analyses revealed elevated levels of HDL-resident ATGL (P = 0.003) and CEPT1 (P < 0.0001), which mediate critical steps of PCps production along the TAG-DAG-PC axis, in GCK-MODY relative to T2D. A panel of four lipids differentiated GCK-MODY from T2D with AUC of 0.950 (95% CI 0.903–9.997). This study provides the first evidence that enhanced recruitment of CEPT1 and ATGL onto HDLs essentially underlie the atheroprotective profiles associated with GCK-MODY.

METHODS We conducted a multicenter cohort study of consecutive acute stroke patients scheduled to undergo endovascular therapy within 90 minutes after a baseline CT perfusion. Patients were classified as ""target mismatch"" if they had a small ischemic core and a large penumbra on their baseline CT perfusion. Reperfusion was defined as >50% reduction in critical hypoperfusion between the baseline CT perfusion and the 36-hour follow-up magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS Of the 201 patients enrolled, 190 patients with an adequate baseline CT perfusion study who underwent angiography were included (mean age = 66 years, median NIH Stroke Scale [NIHSS] = 16, median time from symptom onset to endovascular therapy = 5.2 hours). Rate of reperfusion was 89%. In patients with target mismatch (n = 131), reperfusion was associated with higher odds of favorable clinical response, defined as an improvement of ≥8 points on the NIHSS (83% vs 44%; p = 0.002, adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 6.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.1-20.9).

This study aimed to compare the utilisation of healthcare services for RTIs between individuals with and without diabetes attending primary healthcare centres (PHCCs) in Qatar. DESIGN: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted using an electronic database of all individuals who had a diagnosis of RTI. SETTING: PHCCs in Qatar from July 2015 to December 2017. PARTICIPANTS: Participants in the study were all adult individuals (aged &#8805;18 years) who visited the primary healthcare facilities and were diagnosed with an RTI during the study period. PRIMARY AND OUTCOME MEASURES: For each participant, visits to the healthcare facility, antibiotic use and use of other medications were extracted from the electronic database and compared between participants with and without a diabetes diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 32 857 participants were included, of whom 7407 (22.5%) had a diabetes diagnosis. Results from a negative binomial regression indicate that diabetes diagnosis was significantly associated with increased visits to the healthcare facility (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.10, 95% CI 1.076 to 1.134, p<0.001), antibiotic use (IRR 1.09, 95% CI 1.046 to 1.145, p<0.001) and use of other medications (IRR 1.11, 95% CI 1.078 to 1.143, p<0.001).

Detection of viral RNA splicing for active viral gene expression in a clinical sample is a nucleic acid-based detection. The interpretation of the detected viral RNA splicing results is straightforward without concern for carry-over DNA contamination, because the spliced RNA is smaller than its corresponding DNA template. Although many methods can be used, a simple method to detect viral RNA splicing is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In principle, the detection of spliced RNA transcripts by RT-PCR depends on amplicon selection and primer design. The most common approach is the amplification over the intron regions by a set of primers in flanking exons. A larger product than the predicted size of smaller, spliced RNA is in general an unspliced RNA or contaminating viral genomic DNA. A spliced mRNA always gives a smaller RT-PCR product than its unspliced RNA due to removal of intron sequences by RNA splicing. The contaminating viral DNA can be determined by a minus RT amplification (PCR). Alternatively, specific amplification of a spliced RNA can be obtained by using an exon-exon junction primer because the sequence at exon-exon junction is not present in the unspliced RNA nor in viral genomic DNA.",2018-11-10,"Majerciak, Vladimir; Zheng, Zhi-Ming",Advanced Techniques in Diagnostic Microbiology,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e01695fa634f9a9c68794eb36274230521cb7388.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7121103.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121103/,

Therefore, studying food waste utilization potentials and minimizing its negative consequences becomes imperative. This study aims to assess the technical and economic potentials of substituting corn with unconventional extruded dried Arabic Bread waste (EDABW) in broilers’ diets, in terms of broilers’ performance, carcass characteristic, economic net returns, and income over feed cost (IOFC). One hundred eighty unsexed one-day-old broiler birds of Ross breed were distributed randomly in six treatments (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% EDABW group) of isocaloric and isonitrogenous diets in a completely randomized design with six replicated (5 chicks/replicate). The investigated traits were broilers’ performance (live body weight, total feed intake, total feed conversion ratio, and total weight gain. Other traits such as carcass weight, abdominal fat, edible offal (liver, heart, and gizzard), eviscerated (breast muscles, drum and thigh muscles, and wings) were weighed and expressed based on a live body weight. Results showed that the 20 % replacement level of corn with EDABW generated the highest increase in the live body weight and the eviscerated carcass at about 4.24% g and 4.90%, respectively. On the other hand, the economic analysis showed potential reductions in the broilers’ diet cost and the total broilers' production cost as the levels of corn substitution with by unconventional EDABW increased. The reductions were estimated at 5.1%, 6.3%, 8.4%, 9.3%, and 9.9% at substitution levels of 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%, respectively as compared to the control diet. The results also showed a potential increase in the net economic returns of broiler meat as the increase in substitution levels ranged between 3.5–6.8% and 4.3–8.3% as compared to the control diets using the average retail and wholesale prices of broiler meats, respectively. In addition, the maximum IOFC was estimated potentially at a 20% substitution level of corn with EDABW. Conclusively, the study results show promising technical and economic potentials for unconventional EDABW in broilers’ diets that could lead to a thriving industry of unconventional broilers’ diets with high net economic returns and maximum IOFC.",2020-10-08,"AL Sagan, Ahmed A.; Al-Abdulkader, Ahmed M.; Al-Dakhil, Abdullah I.; Shady, Khalil; Al-Khuraish, Muteb M.",Saudi J Biol Sci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/4590649e863f44632e2eeb167da0cf67210cbbdf.json,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1319562X20304642; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319562X20304642?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2020.09.058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052189/,222210525.0

Hospital readmission rate and ED-visits within 30 days from discharge are considered low-cost quality indicators. This work assesses an indicator of quality of care in a tertiary referral hospital in Argentina, using data available from clinical records. PURPOSE: To estimate the rate of ED-visits and the hospital readmission rate (HRR) after a first hospitalization (First-H), and to identify associated factors. METHODS: This retrospective cohort included patients who had a First-H in Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires between 2014-2015. Follow-up occurred from discharge until ED-visit, readmission, death, disaffiliation from health insurance, or 13 months. We present HRR at 30 days and ED-visits rate at 72 hours, using the Cox proportional-hazards regression model to explore associated factors, and reporting adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with their respective 95%CI. RESULTS: The study comprised 10,598 hospitalizations (median age was 68 years). Of these, 5,966 had at least one consultation to the ED during follow up, resulting in a 24 hour rate of consultations to ED of 1.51% (95%CI 1.29-1.72); at 48 hours 3.18% (95%CI 2.86-3.54); at 72 hours 4.71% (95%CI 4.32-5.13). In multivariable models, factors associated for 72 hours ED-visits were: age (aHR 1.06), male (aHR 1.14), Charlson Comorbidity Index (aHR 1.16), unscheduled hospitalization (aHR 1.39), prior consultation with the ED (aHR 1.08) and long hospital stay (aHR 1.39). Meanwhile, 2,345 patients had at least one hospital readmission (98% unscheduled), resulting a 24 hour rate of 0.5% (95%CI 0.42-0.71), at 48 hours 0.98% (95%CI 0.80-1.18), at 72 hours 1.4% (95%CI 1.2-1.6); at 30 days 7.7% (95%CI 7.2-8.2); at 90 days 13% (95%CI 12.4-13.8); and one-year 22.5% (95%CI 21.7-23.4). Associated factors for HRR at 30 days were: age (HR 1.16), male (HR 1.09), Charlson comorbidities score (HR 1.27), social service requirement during First-H (HR 1.37), unscheduled First-H (HR 1.16), previous ED-visits (HR 1.03) and length of stay (HR 1.08).

During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients taking clozapine will be self-isolating to reduce the risk of infection, not least because these patients are at high risk of serious illness and fatality because of high rates of diabetes, obesity and pulmonary disease and an increased risk of pneumonia. Problems may also arise because both clozapine-induced myocarditis and neutropenic sepsis share signs and symptoms with COVID-19 (fever, chest pain, dyspnoea, etc.). We recommend decreasing the frequency of physical contacts by extending the blood monitoring interval to 12 weeks in those patients taking clozapine for more than 1 year. To distinguish COVID-19 from clozapine-related physical adverse effects, we suggest an urgent antigen test alongside a full blood count. In those taking clozapine who develop COVID-19, we suggest continuing with clozapine whenever possible (even during ventilation), reducing the dose if necessary in line with blood assay results. Blood monitoring should continue but clozapine should only cease if there is a significant fall in neutrophils (COVID-19 is linked to lymphopenia but not neutropenia). To protect against the likelihood and severity of respiratory infection, we recommend the use of vitamin D in all clozapine patients.

These extracellular vesicles also have a cell-free innate antiviral action through attacking and degrading viruses. We further generated the induced versions of Ex/Mv through prior viral exposure to NSCs and found that these induced Ex/Mv were stronger than basal Ex/Mv in reducing the infection of these viruses, suggesting the involvement of an adaptive immunity-like antiviral function. These NSC Ex/Mv were found to be characterized by producing large libraries of piRNAs against genomes of various viruses, and some of these piRNAs were enriched during the adaptive immunity-like reaction, possibly contributing to the antiviral effects of these Ex/Mv.

Methods: In this study, we combined in silico analysis and in vitro transwell experiments to identify a metastasis gene. Then, we used an in vivo experiment to validate the metastasis. Furthermore, a series of experiments such as FACS, Western blot, and ELISA were applied to explore the function of the metastasis gene. Results: LTBP4 (latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein 4) was confirmed as a metastasis gene, whose expression levels are correlated with the overall survival rate of HCC patients. We further showed that the knockout of LTBP4 in an HCC cell line increased cell proliferation, activated the cell cycle, and induced metastasis events. Moreover, we proved that LTBP4-KO could increase the percentage of active TGFß1 secreted by HCC cell lines, as well as the recruitment of MDSCs (myeloid-derived suppressor cells) by active TGFß1 (transforming growth factor beta 1), which further inhibited CD8+ T cell proliferation and activated the immune suppression signal.

AIM: To identify the super-factors causing COVID-19 infection in medical staff in China. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between January 1st and February 30th, 2020, in which front-line members of medical staff who took part in the care and treatment of patients with COVID-19 were enrolled. Epidemiological and demographic data between infected and uninfected groups were collected and compared. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to establish socio-metric social links between influencing factors. FINDINGS: A total of 92 medical staff were enrolled. In all participant groups, the super-factor identified by the network was wearing a medical protective mask or surgical mask correctly (degree: 572; closeness: 25; betweenness centrality: 3.23). Touching the cheek, nose, and mouth while working was the super-factor in the infected group. This was the biggest node in the network and had the strongest influence (degree: 370; closeness: 29; betweenness centrality: 0.37). Self-protection score was the super-factor in the uninfected group but was the isolated factor in the infected group (degree: 201; closeness: 28; betweenness centrality: 5.64). For family members, the exposure history to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and the contact history to wild animals were two isolated nodes.

However, the initial data were reported from single-center or 2-center studies in Chinese populations. Compared with these patients, European and US patients are older, with more comorbidities and higher mortality rates. Objective To evaluate the prevalence and prognostic value of myocardial injury, detected by elevated plasma troponin levels, in a large population of White Italian patients with COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This is a multicenter, cross-sectional study enrolling consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were hospitalized in 13 Italian cardiology units from March 1 to April 9, 2020. Patients admitted for acute coronary syndrome were excluded. Elevated troponin levels were defined as values greater than the 99th percentile of normal values. Main Outcomes and Measures Clinical characteristics and outcomes stratified as elevated or normal cardiac troponin levels at admission, defined as troponin T or troponin I at a level greater than the 99th percentile of normal values. Results A total of 614 patients with COVID-19 were included in this study (mean age [SD], 67 [13] years; 70.8% male), of whom 148 patients (24.1%) died during the hospitalization. Elevated troponin levels were found in 278 patients (45.3%).

To better understand the value of wearing facemasks we undertook a rapid systematic review of existing scientific evidence about development of respiratory illness, linked to use of facemasks in community settings. MethodsWe included all study designs. There were 31 eligible studies (including 12 RCTs). Narrative synthesis and random-effects meta-analysis of attack rates for primary and secondary prevention in 28 studies were performed. Results were reported by design, setting and type of face barrier in primary prevention, and by who wore the facemask (index patient or well contacts) in secondary prevention trials. The preferred outcome was influenza-like illness (ILI) but similar outcomes were pooled with ILI when ILI was unavailable. GRADE quality assessment was based on RCTs with support from observational studies. ResultsWhere specific information was available, most studies reported about use of medical grade (surgical paper masks). In 3 RCTs, wearing a facemask may very slightly reduce the odds of developing ILI/respiratory symptoms, by around 6% (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.19, I 29%, low-certainty evidence). Greater effectiveness was suggested by observational studies. When both house-mates and an infected household member wore facemasks the odds of further household members becoming ill may be modestly reduced by around 19% (OR 0.81, 95%CI 0.48 to 1.37, I 45%, 5 RCTs, low certainty evidence). The protective effect was very small if only the well person (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.28, I 11%, 2 RCTs, low uncertainty evidence) or the infected person wore the facemask (very low certainty evidence). DiscussionBased on the RCTs we would conclude that wearing facemasks can be very slightly protective against primary infection from casual community contact, and modestly protective against household infections when both infected and uninfected members wear facemasks. However, the RCTs often suffered from poor compliance and controls using facemasks. Across observational studies the evidence in favour of wearing facemasks was stronger. We expect RCTs to under-estimate the protective effect and observational studies to exaggerate it. The evidence is not sufficiently strong to support widespread use of facemasks as a protective measure against COVID-19. However, there is enough evidence to support the use of facemasks for short periods of time by particularly vulnerable individuals when in transient higher risk situations. Further high quality trials are needed to assess when wearing a facemask in the community is most likely to be protective.",2020-04-06,"Brainard, Julii Suzanne; Jones, Natalia; Lake, Iain; Hooper, Lee; Hunter, Paul",,,#20049528,,,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.01.20049528,215782289.0

In this study, we aimed to apply statistically more favorable methods to validate the earlier GT-based COVID-19 study results. Methods: We extracted the relative GT search volume for keywords associated with COVID-19 symptoms, and evaluated their Granger-causality to weekly COVID-19 positivity in eight English-speaking countries and Japan. In addition, the impact of media coverage on keywords with significant Granger-causality was further evaluated using Japanese regional data. Results: Our Granger causality-based approach largely decreased (by up to approximately one-third) the number of keywords identified as having a significant temporal relationship with the COVID-19 trend when compared to those identified by the Pearson correlation-based approach. 'Sense of smell' and 'loss of smell' were the most reliable GT keywords across all the evaluated countries; however, when adjusted with their media coverage, these keyword trends did not Granger-cause the COVID-19 positivity trends (in Japan).

Quiescent CD4+ T cells, however, possess cellular factors that limit HIV-1 infection at different postentry steps of the viral life cycle. Here, we show that the previously reported immune regulator monocyte chemotactic protein-induced protein 1 (MCPIP1) restricts HIV-1 production in CD4+ T cells. While the ectopic expression of MCPIP1 in cell lines abolished the production of HIV-1, silencing of MCPIP1 enhanced HIV-1 production. Subsequent analysis indicated that MCPIP1 imposes its restriction by decreasing the steady levels of viral mRNA species through its RNase domain. Remarkably, common T-cell stimuli induced the rapid degradation of MCPIP1 in both T-cell lines and quiescent human CD4+ T cells. Lastly, blocking the proteosomal degradation of MCPIP1 by MG132 abrogated HIV-1 production in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin-stimulated human CD4+ T cells isolated from healthy donors. Overall, MCPIP1 poses a potent barrier against HIV-1 infection at a posttranscriptional stage. Although the observed HIV restriction conferred by MCPIP1 does not seem to be overcome by any viral protein, it is removed during cellular stimulation.

This study evaluates the phenolic compound production, antioxidant and antimicrobial (antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral) activities of transgenic hairy root cultures in M. dioica . Hairy roots were induced from leaves, petiole, and internodal explants. Molecular analysis of PCR and gene sequencing using specific primers of rolC and aux1 revealed T-DNA integration in the hairy root clones and RT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression of hairy root inducible genes (rolC and aux1). The greatest biomass accumulation of hairy roots on MS liquid medium supplemented with 3% sucrose was observed at 22 days. Ultra-HPLC was used to compare the individual phenolic compound contents of transgenic and non-transgenic roots.

90633,awo5h88x,,Medline,Groin defects seen at extra-peritoneal laparoscopic dissection during surgical treatment of athletic pubalgia.,10.1007/s00464-014-3866-2,,25294545,unk,"BACKGROUND Recently new disease process, often referred to as athletic pubalgia (AP), has been acknowledged by the medical community. The patients suffering from this ailment present with unilateral or bilateral chronic groin pain associated with physical activity without a clear diagnosis of a groin hernia. Though physical therapy and medical treatments are considered first line remedies, some believe that surgical treatment may have better, quicker, and more durable outcomes and procedures aimed at groin reinforcement seem to relieve most of symptoms in the majority of the patients. Despite many surgeons consistently noting rectus insertion or adductor thinning, multiple hernia defects are often seen during dissections and the clinical significance of these findings is still not known. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 2007 and 2011, 40 patients underwent an extra-peritoneal laparoscopic reinforcement of rectus abdominals and insertion of adductor muscles for AP. All patients underwent wide and bilateral groin dissection and the findings were cataloged. RESULTS All of the patients presented with groin defects upon wide dissection. Thirty-four patients (85%) presented with small bilateral indirect inguinal defects and 28 (70%) of these patients did not have any additional defects. Five patients (12.5%) were found to have only unilateral inguinal hernia defects. One patient presented with a small direct defect. In addition to these defects, five patients (12.5%) had additional unilateral femoral hernias, whereas no patient had solitary femoral hernia defects. CONCLUSION AP is a new diagnostic entity with poorly understood etiology. It mostly affects young active adults, often involved in competitive sports and surgical methods may be most effective at achieving the cure. In our experience all of the patients presented with groin defects, though not all were the same. It is our belief that these defects, although likely not the only component, play a significant role in the pathophysiology of AP.",2015,"Wikiel, Krzysztof J; Eid, George M",Surgical endoscopy,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-014-3866-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25294545/,13430678.0

Correspondingly, robotic gastroscopes with advanced functionalities, e.g., disposable, dextrous and not invasive solutions, have been developed in the last years. This article extensively reviews these novel devices and describes their functionalities and performance. In addition, the implementation of artificial intelligence technology into robotic gastroscopes, combined with remote telehealth endoscopy services, are discussed. The aim of this paper is to provide a clear and comprehensive view of contemporary robotic gastroscopes and ancillary technologies to support medical practitioners in their future clinical practice but also to inspire and drive new engineering developments. ABSTRACT: Upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract pathology is common worldwide. With recent advancements in robotics, innovative diagnostic and treatment devices have been developed and several translational attempts made. This review paper aims to provide a highly pictorial critical review of robotic gastroscopes, so that clinicians and researchers can obtain a swift and comprehensive overview of key technologies and challenges. Therefore, the paper presents robotic gastroscopes, either commercial or at a progressed technology readiness level. Among them, we show tethered and wireless gastroscopes, as well as devices aimed for UGI surgery. The technological features of these instruments, as well as their clinical adoption and performance, are described and compared. Although the existing endoscopic devices have thus far provided substantial improvements in the effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment, there are certain aspects that represent unwavering predicaments of the current gastroenterology practice. A detailed list includes difficulties and risks, such as transmission of communicable diseases (e.g., COVID-19) due to the doctor–patient proximity, unchanged learning curves, variable detection rates, procedure-related adverse events, endoscopists’ and nurses’ burnouts, limited human and/or material resources, and patients’ preferences to choose non-invasive options that further interfere with the successful implementation and adoption of routine screening. The combination of robotics and artificial intelligence, as well as remote telehealth endoscopy services, are also discussed, as viable solutions to improve existing platforms for diagnosis and treatment are emerging.",2020-09-28,"Marlicz, Wojciech; Ren, Xuyang; Robertson, Alexander; Skonieczna-Żydecka, Karolina; Łoniewski, Igor; Dario, Paolo; Wang, Shuxin; Plevris, John N; Koulaouzidis, Anastasios; Ciuti, Gastone",Cancers (Basel),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/49a567fcfb775915b997c4e5321c7d666baa5eff.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7600666.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32998213/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12102775,222143533.0

Since many coronaviruses are sensitive to heat, heating inactivation of samples at 56°C prior to testing is considered a possible method to reduce the risk of transmission, but the effect of heating on the measurement of SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies is still unclear. METHODS: By comparing the levels of SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies before and after heat inactivation of serum at 56°C for 30 minutes using a quantitative fluorescence immunochromatographic assay RESULTS: We showed that heat inactivation significantly interferes with the levels of antibodies to SARS‐CoV‐2. The IgM levels of all the 34 serum samples (100%) from COVID‐19 patients decreased by an average level of 53.56%. The IgG levels were decreased in 22 of 34 samples (64.71%) by an average level of 49.54%. Similar changes can also be observed in the non–COVID‐19 disease group (n = 9). Of note, 44.12% of the detected IgM levels were dropped below the cutoff value after heating, suggesting heat inactivation can lead to false‐negative results of these samples. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that heat inactivation of serum at 56°C for 30 minutes interferes with the immunoanalysis of antibodies to SARS‐CoV‐2. Heat inactivation prior to immunoanalysis is not recommended, and the possibility of false‐negative results should be considered if the sample was pre‐inactivated by heating.",2020-06-28,"Hu, Xiumei; An, Taixue; Situ, Bo; Hu, Yuhai; Ou, Zihao; Li, Qiang; He, Xiaojing; Zhang, Ye; Tian, Peifu; Sun, Dehua; Rui, Yongyu; Wang, Qian; Ding, Dan; Zheng, Lei",J Clin Lab Anal,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/8f88a624c68c61f379fce0d3b9b90c087b498f38.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7361150.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32594577/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23411,220258058.0

Interestingly, early imaging studies documented that pulmonary vascular thickening was specifically associated with COVID-19 pneumonia, implying a potential tropism of the virus for the pulmonary vasculature. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with inflammation, hypoxia, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage and lung coagulopathy promoting endothelial dysfunction and microthrombosis. These features are strikingly similar to what is seen in pulmonary vascular diseases. Although the consequences of COVID-19 on the pulmonary circulation remain to be explored, several viruses have been previously thought to be involved in the development of pulmonary vascular diseases. Patients with preexisting pulmonary vascular diseases also appear at increased risk of morbidity and mortality.

Results show that MB degradation by the VUV/UV/PS process was significantly higher than that of the conventional UV/PS process, as the VUV photolysis of H(2)O and PS generated more reactive oxygen species (ROSs). HO(•) and SO(4)(•−), identified as the main ROSs, were mostly consumed by dissolved organic carbon and Cl(‒) in real waters, respectively. Additionally, the impacts of solution pH and the concentrations of PS, humic acid, and inorganic ions (HCO(3)(‒), Cl(‒), NO(3)(‒), SO(4)(2‒), Fe(II), and Fe(III)) were systematically evaluated. The solution pH significantly affected the photon absorption distributions, as well as the contributions of photolysis and oxidation to MB degradation, resulting in different variations in the degradation rate constant and total organic carbon removal ratio with increasing solution pH. At all tested pH levels (3.0–11.0), particularly under acidic conditions, HO(•) and SO(4)(•)(−) were two predominant contributors to MB degradation, while VUV and UV photolysis contributed more when the solution pH increased.

Although, Covid-19 commonly presents with marked respiratory symptoms in the form of cough and dyspnoea, a neurotropic presentation has been described of late as well. OBJECTIVE: In this brief communication we report four cases of Covid-19 who presented to our hospital with features suggestive of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). DISCUSSION: The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 causes neurologic damage are multifaceted, including direct damage to specific receptors, cytokine-related injury, secondary hypoxia, and retrograde travel along nerve fibres. The pathogenesis of GBS secondary to Covid-19 is not well understood. It is hypothesised that viral illnesses related GBS could be due to autoantibodies or direct neurotoxic effects of viruses.

Dark side of the heart: A simple approach for a forgotten structure,,,,unk,"PURPOSE: Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is currently the election method for initial screening of left ventricular papillary muscles (PM). However, diagnosis of borderline PM hypertrophy with TTE is not always feasible due to cumbersome interpretation of different PM diameters and the absence of precise normal ranges in the literature. The objective of this study was to obtain TTE normal cutoff values and to describe convenient indexes of PM dimensions. METHODS: Healthy volunteers with normal electrocardiogram were included for TTE assessment. Vertical (Vd) and horizontal (Hd) PM diameters were measured to obtain maximum diameter (Md) and areas of the anterolateral PM (APM) and posteromedial PM (PPM) to obtain PM total area (PMTA). RESULTS: A total of 82 patients were screened, and 6 (7.3%) with bifid PM were excluded from analysis. APM and PPM had similar Vd (APM: 8.3 ± 1.2, PPM: 7.9 ± 1.1 mm2 , P = NS) and Hd (APM: 8.2 ± 1.3, PPM: 8.3 ± 1.2 mm2 , P = NS). Finally, Md (9 ± 1.2 mm; P95 = 11 mm) and PMTA (106.5 ± 24.2 mm2 ; P95 = 150.8 mm2 ) were obtained. Correlation between PMTA and Md was positive (P < .001), and out-of-range values for Md and PMTA were similar (2.6% vs 5.3%); there was excellent agreement between both indexes (K = 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Maximum diameter and PMTA are convenient indexes to describe PM dimensions.

Still, the pathogenic mechanisms behind SARS-CoV-2 have been partially deciphered and the current therapies have not yet met the initial enthusiastic expectations. So far COVID-19 therapies have targeted various pathogenic mechanisms, namely the neutralization of ACE2 receptors or SARS-CoV-2 spike protein epitopes, the disruption of the endocytic pathways using hydroxychloroquine, arbidol, or anti-Janus kinase inhibitors, the inhibition of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase using nucleotide analogues such as remdesivir, immunosuppressive drugs or molecules acting on the immune response (corticoids, interferons, monoclonal antibodies against inflammatory cytokines, mesenchymal stem cells) and convalescent plasma administration together with numerous drugs with unproven effect against SARS-CoV-2 but with potential antiviral activities (antiretrovirals, antimalarial drugs, antibiotics, etc.).

The relationship between these parameters and the demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related indices of the regions under study was examined using both bivariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: COVID-19 prevalence was negatively associated with male-to-female sex ratio (defined as the number of females per 1000 male population) and positively associated with the presence of an international airport in a particular state. The crude mortality rate for COVID-19 was negatively associated with sex ratio and the statewise burden of diarrheal disease, and positively associated with the statewise burden of ischemic heart disease. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that the COVID-19 crude mortality rate was significantly and negatively associated with sex ratio. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the transmission and impact of COVID-19 in a given population may be influenced by a number of variables, with demographic factors showing the most consistent association.",2020-11-27,"Rajkumar, Ravi Philip",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,,,,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7717919.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33147164/; https://doi.org/10.2196/23083,226260174.0

The present study aimed to assess the demographic variables, causes, and patterns of maxillofacial injuries managed at a teaching hospital in Wuhan City during the transmission control measures in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. In this retrospective study, all patients treated for maxillofacial injuries in the hospital between January 23 and April 7 (2019 and 2020) were involved. Epidemiologic information, including the number of patients, gender, age, etiology, time since injury to the clinic visit, and type of maxillofacial injuries, was recorded. Data of the 2 periods (2019 and 2020) were compared and analyzed. A total of 337 patients had maxillofacial injuries at the 2-time intervals: 74 in 2020 and 263 in 2019. The characteristics of maxillofacial injuries had changes during the transmission control measures in the COVID-19 epidemic, which included the number of patients, gender, age, etiology, time since injury to the clinic visit, and type of maxillofacial injuries. The transmission control measures during the COVID-19 epidemic had a significant impact on the epidemiology of maxillofacial injuries in Wuhan City.",2021,"Yang, Yu-Ting; Xing, Xin; Sreekissoon, Senjeet; Li, Zhi",J. craniofac. surg,,#1020334,,,,,231576176.0

Design A prospective observational study. Setting A medical center in Taiwan. Participants Two hundred thirty HCWs. Intervention NPS examination for the presence of SARS-CoV by two nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. Measurements and results During the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), NPS polymerase chain reaction screening of HCWs for SARS-CoV was performed. SARS-CoV was examined by two nested RT-PCRs and a quantitative RT-PCR. Serum-specific antibodies were assessed by enzyme immunoassay and indirect immunofluorescence. We monitored 230 HCWs, including 217 first-line HCWs and 13 non–first-line HCWs. One hundred ninety first-line HCWs and 13 non–first-line HCWs had negative results in both nested RT-PCR assays. Two first-line HCWs who were positive on both nested RT-PCR assays had SARS. They had 16,900 ± 7,920 copies (mean ± SD) of RNA per milliliter in the NPS and had detectable anti-SARS antibodies. The remaining 25 first-line HCWs were negative for the first nested RT-PCR but positive for the second nested RT-PCR. Their corresponding titers were 338 ± 227 copies of RNA per milliliter; antibodies developed in none of these 25 HCWs. The expression and function of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 were not different among these HCWs. This study shows that colonization of SARS-CoV occurred in 25 of 217 well-protected first-line HCWs on a SARS-associated service, but they remained seronegative. Conclusion With the second RT-PCR assay more sensitive than the first RT-PCR assay, we are able to show that approximately 11.5% of well-protected HCWs exposed to SARS patients or specimens may have colonization without seroconversion. Only those with significant clinical symptoms or disease would have active immunity. Thus, regular NPS screening for nested RT-PCR assays in conjunction with a daily recording of body temperature in all first-line HCWs may provide an effective way of early detection.",2006-01-31,"Ho, Hsin-Tsung; Chang, Mau-Sun; Wei, Tsai-Yin; Hsieh, Wen-Shyang; Hung, Chia-Chien; Yang, Huei-Mei; Lu, Yen-Ta",Chest,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/1567b15f056268a550ea0d0409437f11b1167f3a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094471.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369215315270; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369215315270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16424418/,11026367.0

Prehospital and transport settings require fluid warmers to be small, energy efficient and independent of external power supply. We compared the warming properties and resistance to flow of currently available battery-operated fluid warmers. METHODS Fluid warming was evaluated at 50, 100 and 200 mL/min at a constant input temperature of 20°C and 10°C using a cardiopulmonary bypass roller pump and cooler. Output temperature was continuously recorded. RESULTS Performance of fluid warmers varied with flows and input temperatures. At an input temperature of 20°C and flow of 50 mL/min, the Buddy Lite, enFlow, Thermal Angel and Warrior warmed 3.4, 2.4, 1 and 3.6 L to over 35°C, respectively. However, at an input temperature of 10°C and flow of 200 mL/min, the Buddy Lite failed to warm, the enFlow warmed 3.3 L to 25.7°C, the Thermal Angel warmed 1.5 L to 20.9°C and the Warrior warmed 3.4 L to 34.4°C (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION We found significant differences between the fluid warmers: the use of the Buddy Lite should be limited to moderate input temperature and low flow rates. The use of the Thermal Angel is limited to low volumes due to battery capacity and low output temperature at extreme conditions. The Warrior provides the best warming performance at high infusion rates, as well as low input temperatures, and was able to warm the largest volumes in these conditions.",2018,"Lehavi, Amit; Yitzhak, Avraham; Jarassy, Refael; Heizler, Rami; Katz, Yeshayahu Shai; Raz, Aeyal",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2017-207112; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29880720/,46983373.0

TEP inguinal hernia repair affords the opportunity to repair any groin hernia through the same small incisions. US detects 96.6% of groin hernias with 84.4% specificity. METHODS 234 consecutive male patients with clinically unilateral and clinically bilateral hernia were enrolled; those with a clinically unilateral hernia were sent for groin US and if positive, a bilateral TEP groin hernia repair was performed (USBH). If negative, a unilateral TEP groin hernia repair was performed (UNIH). Carolina's comfort scales (CCS) and visual analogue scores (VAS) were recorded at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively, while a modified CCS (MCCS) was recorded for all patients preoperatively. RESULTS Bilateral TEP repair resulted in higher VAS scores than unilateral repair at 2 weeks but not 6 weeks. CCS were worse in the USBH group than UNIH group at 2 weeks but were similar by 6 weeks. Complications' rates were similar amongst all 3 groups. Factors contributing to worse scores were: smaller hernia, complications, worse preoperative MCCS results, recurrent hernia and bilateral rather than unilateral repair.

Existing research has provided mixed evidence concerning the diagnostic demarcation of AN and AAN. The aim of the present study was to identify research priorities for furthering the understanding of AN and AAN as diagnostic entities. METHOD: Employing the Delphi methodology, experts in the field were invited to suggest research questions that need to be explored in the demarcation of AN from AAN. This yielded 24 research areas, that were presented in subsequent rounds where panelists were asked to prioritize areas of primary interest. RESULTS: Fifty-three panelists completed all three Delphi rounds. Consensus was only reached on three items considered to be of primary interest: medical, neurobiological, and neurological factors; epidemiology and natural course; and treatment response in AAN compared to AN. In contrast, questions of premorbid weight and determining the need for and nature of a body mass index cutoff differentiating between AAN and AN were seen as being of low priority. DISCUSSION: These findings reveal a relatively low degree of consensus on the demarcation of AN from AAN in the field of eating disorders. A reason could be that the definition and use of the AAN category vary in research and clinical practice. In order to achieve further diagnostic clarity, research on the demarcation of AAN and AN should focus on the identified prioritized research areas.",2020,"Strand, Mattias; Zvrskovec, Johan; Hübel, Christopher; Peat, Christine M; Bulik, Cynthia M; Birgegård, Andreas",Int J Eat Disord,,#32735068,,,,,220891417.0

The impact of menopausal age on UIAs and treatment outcomes with endovascular therapy has not been well studied. We hypothesized that premenopausal age may have a protective effect on presentation size and treatment outcomes. Objective To evaluate the association of menopause with UIA size and outcome with endovascular therapy. Methods Retrospective analysis of consecutive female patients with UIAs treated with endovascular therapy at our academic tertiary care center. UIA characteristics, complications, and outcomes were recorded and compared. Results 117 patients were included: 23 patients in the premenopausal age (PRM) group and 94 in the postmenopausal age (POM) group. 93.6% of all aneurysms in the PRM group were in the internal carotid artery (ICA) segments (p < 0.05). Hence only ICA segment aneurysms were further studied. A total of 21 patients in the PRM group and 60 in the POM group were found to have ICA segment aneurysms. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. The mean size of the aneurysms in the PRM group was 8.6 ± 3.9 versus 10.8 ± 5.6 mm in the POM group (p = 0.055). There was a trend to higher aneurysm neck size seen in the POM group (4.7 ± 2.5 vs. 3.7 ± 1.7 mm; p = 0.07). The number of aneurysm lobes was higher in the PRM group (1.23 ± 0.54 vs. 1.07 ± 0.31; p = 0.18). In multivariate analysis, the PRM group had a significantly higher number of UIA lobes. Complications and endovascular therapy outcomes were similar between the 2 groups.

We use a mathematical model of viral coinfection to study SARS‐CoV‐2 coinfections, finding that SARS‐CoV‐2 replication is easily suppressed by many common respiratory viruses. According to our model, this suppression is because SARS‐CoV‐2 has a lower growth rate (1.8 /d) than the other viruses examined in this study.

In this framework, the aim of the present review was to summarize the results on the application of functional compounds from olive pomace in food products. Phenolics-rich extracts from olive pomace were added to vegetable oils, fish burgers, fermented milk and in the edible coating of fruit, in order to take advantage of their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Moreover, olive pomace was directly used in the formulation of pasta and baked goods, by exploiting polyunsaturated fatty acids, phenolic compounds and dietary fiber to obtain high-value added healthy foods and/or to extend their shelf-life. With the same scope, olive pomace was also added to animal feeds obtaining healthy-improved animal products. Furthermore, different authors used olive pomace to produce biodegradable materials and/or active packaging able to increase the content of bioactive compounds and the oxidative stability of foods. Overall, the results highlighted in most cases the effectiveness of the addition of olive pomace-derived functional compounds in improving the nutritional value, the quality and/or the shelf-life of foods. However, more challenging was found to be the direct addition of olive pomace, especially due to alterations of sensory and textural features of food. This article is protected by copyright.

In high burden HIV/TB countries, the spread of COVID-19 among people living with HIV is a well-founded concern. A thorough understanding of HIV/TB and COVID-19 pandemics is important as the three diseases interact. This may clarify HIV/TB/COVID-19 as a newly related field. However, several gaps remain in the knowledge of the burden of COVID-19 on patients with TB and HIV. This study was conducted to review different studies on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or COVID-19 associated with HIV/TB co-infection or only TB, to understand the interactions between HIV, TB and COVID-19 and its implications on the burden of the COVID-19 among HIV/TB co-infected or TB patients, screening algorithm and clinical management. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of potentially eligible studies published in English in the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials, PubMed, Medrxiv, Google scholar and Clinical Trials Registry databases. We included case studies, case series and observational studies published between January, 2002 and July, 2020 in which SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and COVID-19 co-infected to HIV/TB or TB in adults. We screened titles, abstracts and full articles for eligibility. Descriptive and meta-analysis were done and results have been presented in graphs and tables. RESULTS: After removing 95 duplicates, 58 out of 437 articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 14 studies were included for descriptive analysis and seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to the descriptive analysis, the meta-analysis showed strong evidence that current TB exposure was high-risk COVID-19 group (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.06–2.65, P = 0.03). The pooled of COVID-19/TB severity rate increased from OR 4.50 (95% CI 1.12–18.10, P = 0.03), the recovery rate was high among COVID-19 compared to COVID-19/TB irrespective of HIV status (OR 2.23, 95% CI 1.83–2.74, P < 0.001) and the mortality was reduced among non-TB group (P < 0.001).

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a routine investigation tool in intensive care unit and could enhance microaspiration. This study aimed at evaluating the impact of TEE on microaspiration and VAP in intubated critically ill adult patients. METHODS: It is a four-center prospective observational study. Microaspiration biomarkers (pepsin and salivary amylase) concentrations were quantitatively measured on tracheal aspirates drawn before and after TEE. The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients with TEE-associated microaspiration, defined as: (1) ≥ 50% increase in biomarker concentration between pre-TEE and post-TEE samples, and (2) a significant post-TEE biomarker concentration (> 200 μg/L for pepsin and/or > 1685 IU/L for salivary amylase). Secondary endpoints included the development of VAP within three days after TEE and the evolution of tracheal cuff pressure throughout TEE. RESULTS: We enrolled 100 patients (35 females), with a median age of 64 (53–72) years. Of the 74 patients analyzed for biomarkers, 17 (23%) got TEE-associated microaspiration. However, overall, pepsin and salivary amylase levels were not significantly different between before and after TEE, with wide interindividual variability. VAP occurred in 19 patients (19%) within 3 days following TEE. VAP patients had a larger tracheal tube size and endured more attempts of TEE probe introduction than their counterparts but showed similar aspiration biomarker concentrations. TEE induced an increase in tracheal cuff pressure, especially during insertion and removal of the probe. CONCLUSIONS: We could not find any association between TEE-associated microaspiration and the development of VAP during the three days following TEE in intubated critically ill patients. However, our study cannot formally rule out a role for TEE because of the high rate of VAP observed after TEE and the limitations of our methods.",2020-12-07,"Bagate, François; Rouzé, Anahita; Zerimech, Farid; Boissier, Florence; Labbe, Vincent; Razazi, Keyvan; Carteaux, Guillaume; de Prost, Nicolas; Balduyck, Malika; Maboudou, Patrice; Nseir, Saad; Mekontso Dessap, Armand",Crit Care,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/107631d276923b3698df47f531ed540ee54c6b3b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7719845.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7719845/,

Murine leukemia virions pseudotyped with Ebo-GP contain almost exclusively processed glycoprotein, indicating that this is the mature form of Ebo-GP. Mutational analysis identified a dibasic motif, reminiscent of furin-like protease processing sites, as the Ebo-GP cleavage site. However, analysis of Ebo-GP processing in LoVo cells that lack the proprotein convertase furin demonstrated that furin is not required for processing of Ebo-GP. In sharp contrast to other viral systems, we found that an uncleaved mutant of Ebo-GP was able to mediate infection of various cell lines as efficiently as the wild-type, proteolytically cleaved glycoprotein, indicating that cleavage is not required for the activation of Ebo-GP despite the conservation of a dibasic cleavage site in all filoviral envelope glycoproteins.",1999,"Wool-Lewis, R J; Bates, P",Journal of virology,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9882347/,22004732.0

DI particles and related satellite genomes of the plant RNA viruses are generated by a wide variety of animal, plant, and fungal viruses. The ubiquity of DI viruses was first clearly recognized by Huang and Baltimore. They proposed and defined the term “DI particle” to include defective viruses containing only some portion of the infectious virus genome, requiring homologous parental virus as a helper for the replication, containing virus structural proteins and antigens, and exhibiting the capacity to replicate preferentially at the expense of infectious helper virus in cells infected by both. Satellite RNAs of plants are small RNAs that usually share little or no homology with their helper viruses, although some do exhibit some sequence homology with their helper viruses, and thus resemble DI particles in at least a portion of their genomes. Depending on the leaving sites and resumption sites, DI particles can be produced that are simple internal deletions of the virus genome, simple deletions with a new terminus, or complex or bizarre genomes with multiple rearrangements of the virus segments. DI viruses and defective viruses generally are widespread in nature.

Limb prosthesis vendors thus desire to offer the leg-amputee a complete and well-organized training process, but they often fail to do so owing to the factors such as the limited support of human resource and financial condition of the amputee.

In real applications, time series are often labeled by an expert or by an imprecise process, leading to noisy classes. Several algorithms have been developed to handle uncertain labels in case of non-temporal data sets.

Although inflammation and its influence on plasticity in multiple neural systems has been extensively studied, its effects on plasticity of neural networks controlling vital life functions, such as breathing, are less understood. In this study, we investigated the signaling mechanisms whereby lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation impairs plasticity within the phrenic motor system-a major spinal respiratory motor pool that drives contractions of the diaphragm muscle. Here, we tested the hypotheses that lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation (1) blocks phrenic motor plasticity by a mechanism that requires cervical spinal okadaic acid-sensitive serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP) 1/2A activity and (2) prevents phosphorylation/activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen activated protein kinase (ERK1/2 MAPK)-a key enzyme necessary for the expression of phrenic motor plasticity. METHODS To study phrenic motor plasticity, we utilized a well-characterized model for spinal respiratory plasticity called phrenic long-term facilitation (pLTF). pLTF is characterized by a long-lasting, progressive enhancement of inspiratory phrenic nerve motor drive following exposures to moderate acute intermittent hypoxia (mAIH). In anesthetized, vagotomized and mechanically ventilated adult Sprague Dawley rats, we examined the effect of inhibiting cervical spinal serine/threonine PP 1/2A activity on pLTF expression in sham-vehicle and LPS-treated rats. Using immunofluorescence optical density analysis, we compared mAIH-induced phosphorylation/activation of ERK 1/2 MAPK with and without LPS-induced inflammation in identified phrenic motor neurons. RESULTS We confirmed that mAIH-induced pLTF is abolished 24 h following low-dose systemic LPS (100 μg/kg, i.p.). Cervical spinal delivery of the PP 1/2A inhibitor, okadaic acid, restored pLTF in LPS-treated rats. LPS also prevented mAIH-induced enhancement in phrenic motor neuron ERK1/2 MAPK phosphorylation. Thus, a likely target for the relevant okadaic acid-sensitive protein phosphatases is ERK1/2 MAPK or its upstream activators.

However, precise hemostatic changes in the very early stage of the disease are not completely studied. The aim of the study was to study von Willebrand factor (vWF) and coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) plasma levels and activity in the first hours (up to 24 h) of PAF clinical manifestation. Material and methods: We selected consecutively 51 non-anticoagulated patients (26 men, 25 women, mean age: 59.84 ±1.60) with PAF and 52 controls (26 men, 26 women, mean age: 59.50 ±1.46 years) corresponding in gender, accompanying diseases and conducted treatment. The indicators were examined using enzyme-linked immunoassays and photometric tests. Results: All patients were hospitalized between the 2nd and 24th h after the onset of arrhythmia (mean: 8.14 ±0.74 h). Higher FVIII levels (107.52 ±3.48% vs. 93.85 ±2.93%, p < 0.05) and activity (200.03 ±11.11% vs. 109.73 ±4.90%, p < 0.001) were found in the PAF group. vWF levels (178.40 ±12.95% vs. 119.53 ±6.12%, p < 0.001) and activity (200.92 ±12.45% vs. 110.80 ±5.14%, p < 0.001) were also higher. These changes did not depend on age, sex, body mass index or CHA2DS2-VASc score in the PAF group (p > 0.05). PAF duration was a significant predictor of increased FVIII levels and activity. Increased PAF duration was followed by increased values of the factors (r = 0.85, p < 0.001; r = 0.83, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The results presented an activated coagulation cascade and endothelial injury, suggesting hypercoagulability still in the early hours of PAF.

AIM To investigate patient preferences for treatment settings in the light of the current pandemic. METHODS Patients, who prior to the pandemic had attended two different outpatient clinics in a university hospital for their infusions or injections, were interviewed by telephone. The semi-structured interviews were analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods. RESULTS Out of 49 patients with either anti-inflammatory or immunoglobulin treatments (response rate: 83 %), 24 (49.0 %) switched from subcutaneous (sc) injections in the hospital to the community setting, 18 (36.7 %) from intravenous infusions (iv) in the hospital to sc administration at home and 7 (14.3 %) moved to iv at home. During the pandemic 38 (80.9 %) wanted to continue their treatment at home, but after the pandemic 22 (46.8 %) would opt to go back to the hospital. Satisfaction was high with both settings, slightly favoring drug administration in hospital. Qualitative data shows that patients while emphasizing the importance of the relationship with the healthcare team, had increased concerns about safety as a result of COVID-19.

202798,yy01n9c4,,WHO,Small Molecule Adjuvants Potentiate Colistin Activity and Attenuate Resistance Development in Escherichia coli by Affecting pmrAB System,,,,unk,"Background: Colistin is one of the last-resort antibiotics to treat multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacterial infections in humans. Further, colistin has been also used to prevent and treat Enterobacteriaceae infections in food animals. However, chromosomal mutations and mobile colistin resistance (mcr) genes, which confer resistance to colistin, have been detected in bacterial isolates from food animals and humans worldwide; thus, limiting the use of colistin. Therefore, strategies that could aid in ameliorating colistin resistance are critically needed. Objective: Investigate the adjuvant potential of novel small molecules (SMs) on colistin. Materials and Methods: Previously, we identified 11 membrane-affecting SMs with bactericidal activity against avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC). Here, we investigated the potentiation effect of those SMs on colistin using checkerboard assays and wax moth (Galleria mellonella) larval model. The impact of the SM combination on colistin resistance evolution was also investigated by analyzing whole genome sequences of APEC isolates passaged with colistin alone or in combination with SMs followed by quantitating pmrCAB and pmrH expression in those isolates. Results: The SM combination synergistically reduced the minimum bactericidal concentration of colistin by at least 10-fold. In larvae, the SM combination increased the efficacy of colistin by two-fold with enhanced (>50%) survival and reduced (>4 logs) APEC load. Further, the SM combination decreased the frequency (5/6 to 1/6) of colistin resistance evolution and downregulated the pmrCAB and pmrH expression. Previously unknown mutations in pmrB (L14Q, T92P) and pmrA (A80V), which were predicted deleterious, were identified in the colistin-resistant (ColR) APEC isolates when passaged with colistin alone but not in combination with SMs. Our study also identified mutations in hypothetical and several phage-related proteins in ColR APEC isolates in concurrent with pmrAB mutations. Conclusion: Our study identified two SMs (SM2 and SM3) that potentiated the colistin activity and attenuated the development of colistin resistance in APEC. These SMs can be developed as anti-evolution drugs that can slow down colistin resistance development.",2020,"Kathayat, Dipak; Antony, Linto; Deblais, Loic; Helmy, Yosra A; Scaria, Joy; Rajashekara, Gireesh",Infect Drug Resist,,#32764996,,,,,220970141.0

To address this, we developed and clinically validated the sensitivity and specificity of a real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay targeting the viral 5' noncoding region defined by sequences obtained from all 100 currently recognized HRV prototype strains and 85 recently circulating field isolates. The assay successfully amplified all HRVs tested and could reproducibly detect 50 HRV RNA transcript copies, with a dynamic range of over 7 logs. In contrast, a quantified RNA transcript of human enterovirus 68 (HEV68) that showed the greatest sequence homology to the HRV primers and probe set was not detected below a concentration of 5 x 10(5) copies per reaction.

Despite the scarcity of publicly available data, scientists around the world have made strides in estimating the magnitude of the epidemic, the basic reproduction number, and transmission patterns. Recently more evidence suggests that a substantial fraction of the infected individuals with the novel coronavirus show little if any symptoms, which suggest the need to reassess the transmission potential of this emerging disease. In this study, we derive estimates of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan City, China, by reconstructing the underlying transmission dynamics using multiple data sources. MethodsWe employ statistical methods and publicly available epidemiological datasets to jointly derive estimates of transmissibility and severity associated with the novel coronavirus. For this purpose, the daily series of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Wuhan City and epidemiological data of Japanese evacuees from Wuhan City on board government-chartered flights were integrated into our analysis. ResultsOur posterior estimates of basic reproduction number (R) in Wuhan City, China in 2019-2020 reached values as high as 5.20 (95%CrI: 5.04-5.47) and the enhanced public health intervention after January 23rd in 2020 was associated with a declined R at 0.58 (95%CrI: 0.51-0.64), with the total number of infections (i.e. cumulative infections) estimated at 1905526 (95%CrI: 1350283- 2655936) in Wuhan City, raising the proportion of infected individuals to 19.1% (95%CrI: 13.5-26.6%). We also found that most recent crude infection fatality ratio (IFR) and time-delay adjusted IFR is estimated to be 0.04% (95% CrI: 0.03%-0.06%) and 0.12% (95%CrI: 0.08-0.17%), which is several orders of magnitude smaller than the crude CFR estimated at 4.19% ConclusionsWe have estimated key epidemiological parameters of the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China during January-February, 2020 using an ecological modelling approach.

It is necessary to identify indicators that can be used as optimal predictors for clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: The clinical information from 126 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were collected from Wuhan Fourth Hospital. Specific clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes were analyzed from patients hospitalized for treatment from 1 February to 15 March 2020, and subsequently died or were discharged. A random forest (RF) algorithm was used to predict the prognoses of COVID-19 patients and identify the optimal diagnostic predictors for patients’ clinical prognoses. RESULTS: Seven of the 126 patients were excluded for losing endpoints, 103 of the remaining 119 patients were discharged (alive) and 16 died in the hospital. A synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was used to correct the imbalanced distribution of clinical patients. Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was used to select the optimal subset for analysis. Eleven clinical parameters, Myo, CD8, age, LDH, LMR, CD45, Th/Ts, dyspnea, NLR, D-Dimer and CK were chosen with AUC approximately 0.9905. The RF algorithm was built to predict the prognoses of COVID-19 patients based on the best subset, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the test data was 100%. Moreover, two optimal clinical risk predictors, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and Myoglobin (Myo), were selected based on the Gini index. The univariable logistic analysis revealed a substantial increase in the risk for in-hospital mortality when Myo was higher than 80 ng/ml (OR = 7.54, 95% CI [3.42–16.63]) and LDH was higher than 500 U/L (OR = 4.90, 95% CI [2.13–11.25]). CONCLUSION: We applied an RF algorithm to predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients with high accuracy and identified LDH higher than 500 U/L and Myo higher than 80 ng/ml to be potential risk factors for the prognoses of COVID-19 patients in the early stage of the disease.",2020-09-09,"Wang, Jie; Yu, Heping; Hua, Qingquan; Jing, Shuili; Liu, Zhifen; Peng, Xiang; Cao, Cheng’an; Luo, Yongwen",PeerJ,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/38606f1fca2838a6c31ac0e3cb81e62ce07d0720.json; document_parses/pdf_json/761d6f7419d8ea832f10e2caee05e01ffff77f37.json; document_parses/pdf_json/5f7236c0c6d98e51e27930c2c86bee0b7cf10e34.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7486830.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32974109/,221858281.0

The sphere radius of the acetabulum, the sphere radius of the femoral head, and the deviation of the centre of rotation of the femoral head from that of the acetabulum were analysed. RESULTS: The sphere radii of the acetabulum and femoral head were significantly larger in dysplastic hips. Distances between the centre of rotation of the acetabulum and that of the femoral head were significantly larger in dysplastic group than in control group. The centre of rotation of the femoral head was significantly deviated anterosuperiorly in dysplastic hips.

Besides the threat posed by the global proliferation of BW technologies, there are numerous emerging and reemerging ID agents with significant public health consequences. Further compounding this already complicated situation are the estimated 600 million international tourists annually, many with the potential to the spread disease globally in a matter of hours. While clinical laboratories have key roles in the detection and identification of potential ID/BW agents, most staff are unfamiliar with these agents because of their rarity and the often laborious conventional methodologies needed to identify them. To meet this challenge, a vast array of rapid assay strategies has been developed for use in clinical diagnostics and environmental detection. Technologies have been developed or adapted to the challenges posed by these agents, permitting detection and identification in several minutes to hours. In particular, the development of improved reagents and detection systems has led to dramatic improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of immunological and nucleic acid-based systems, allowing an ever-increasing range of analytes to be identified and quantitated. In the accompanying articles, we have brought together experts from the many overlapping aspects of this arena in order to present a comprehensive and critical analysis of these technologies.",2003,"Peruski, Leonard F; Peruski, Anne Harwood",BioTechniques,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14579750/,23678172.0

The presence of respiratory syncitial virus (RSV), human Metapneumoviruses (hMPVs), human Bocaviruses (hBoVs), and human Coronaviruses (hCoVs) was assayed by molecular detection and clinical symptoms evaluated. Nasopharyngeal aspirates from 150 of the 322 infants (46.6%) tested positive for at least one pathogen. Ninety samples (28.0%) tested positive for RSV RNA (61.5% genotype A and 38.5% genotype B), 46 (14.3%) for hMPV RNA (71.7% subtype A and 28.3% subtype B), 28 (8.7%) for hCoV RNA (39.3% hCoV‐OC43, 35.7% hCoV‐NL63, 21.4% hCoV‐HKU1, and 3.6% hCoV‐229E), and 7 (2.2%) for hBoV DNA (of the 6 typed, 50% subtype 1 and 50% subtype 2); 21/150 samples revealed the presence of 2 or more viruses. Co‐infection rates were higher for hMPVs, hCoVs, and hBoV (38.3%, 46.4%, and 57.1%,) and lower for RSV (23.3%). RSV was associated with the presence of complications (P < 0.001) and hypoxia (P < 0.015). When the presence of RSV alone and the RSV‐hMPV co‐infections were considered, RSV mono‐infected patients resulted to have longer hospitalization and higher hypoxia (P < 0.001). The data highlight that (i) RSV has a central role as a respiratory pathogen of infants, (ii) the wide circulation of recently identified viruses does not reduce the clinical and epidemiological importance of RSV, and that (iii) recently identified agents (hMPVs, hBoVs, and hCoVs) act as primary pathogens or co‐pathogens.

Methods: Three methods were used to assess changes in responses to COVID-19. First, website visits and call centre traffic were compared across two time periods: the “comparison period” (1 to 28 September 2019), and during the early weeks of the “COVID-19 pandemic” (19 March to 15 April 2020). Second, demographic and symptom data were compared across all patients who started an assessment during the comparison (n = 1650) and the COVID-19 period (n = 1668). Third, responses to questions about the impact of COVID-19 introduced to the assessment from 19 March 2020, and reports from treating therapists were examined. Results: There was an 89% increase in website visits and a 90% increase in telephone calls to the clinic in the early COVID-19 period compared to the comparison period. There was a higher proportion of females in the COVID-19 sample (76.9% vs. 72.9%), and a lower proportion reported being in employment (52.8% vs. 60.8%). There was a small but significant increase in the severity of anxiety symptoms, and an increase in the number of people reporting recent onset of anxiety and depression. However, there were no differences between groups in severity of symptoms of distress or depression. Most people (94%) reported concern about the impact of COVID-19, and 88% reported making changes in lifestyle. Older adults had higher levels of concern about COVID-19. Therapists reported that patients were concerned about how to access testing, manage quarantine, financial security and the effect of social isolation. Conclusions: COVID-19 has resulted in a significant increase in contact with an established DMHS, but we have not yet detected increases in baseline symptom severity.

It is therefore possible to control viral infections by manipulating host factors that are critical for viral replication. Given that host genes may play essential roles in certain cellular processes, any successful manipulations for virus control should cause no or mild effects on host fitness. We previously showed that a group of positive-strand RNA viruses enrich phosphatidylcholine (PC) at the sites of viral replication. Specifically, brome mosaic virus (BMV) replication protein 1a interacts with and recruits a PC synthesis enzyme phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase, Cho2p, to the viral replication sites that are assembled on the perinuclear ER membrane. Deletion of the CHO2 gene inhibited BMV replication by 5-fold, however, slowed down cell growth as well. Here, we show that an engineered Cho2p mutant supports general PC synthesis and normal cell growth but blocks BMV replication. This mutant interacts and co-localizes with BMV 1a but prevents BMV 1a from localizing to the perinuclear ER membrane. The mislocalized BMV 1a fails to induce the formation of viral replication complexes.

We retrospectively compared the pancreato-jejunostomy technique with the hand-sewn closure of the pancreatic stump after DP, and analyzed clinical outcomes between the two groups, focusing on PF rate. METHODS Thirty-six patients undergoing open DP at our institution between May 2005 and December 2011 were included. They were divided in two groups depending on pancreatic remnant management: in 24 cases the stump was closed by hand-sewn suture (Group A), while in 12 earlier cases a pancreato-jejunostomy was performed (Group B). We analyzed postoperative data in terms of mortality, morbidity and length of hospital stay between the two groups. RESULTS PF occurred in 7 of 24 (29.1%) cases of group A (control group) compared to zero fistula rate in group B (anastomosis group) (p=0.005). Operative time was significantly higher in the anastomosis group (p=0.024). Mortality rate was 0% in both groups. Other postoperative outcomes such as hemorrhages, infections, medical complications and length of hospital stay were not significant between the two groups.

Thirty-four women underwent major gynaecological surgery with isoflurane/air and atracurium. Eleven women responded on 32 occasions with appropriate hand movements to commands given during surgery, of which the bispectral index detected 17 (sensitivity 53%). The bispectral index suggested consciousness 660 times in the absence of any movement responses (specificity 69%). The positive predictive value of the bispectral index was 3%.

Recent trials in low- and middle-income countries showed that CRP testing could safely reduce antibiotic use in patients with non-severe acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and fever in primary care. The studies, however, were conducted in a research-oriented context, with research staff closely monitoring healthcare behaviour thus potentially influencing healthcare workers’ prescribing practices. For policy-makers to consider wide-scale roll-out, a pragmatic implementation study of the impact of CRP point of care (POC) testing in routine care is needed. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A pragmatic, cluster-randomised controlled trial, with two study arms, consisting of 24 commune health centres (CHC) in the intervention arm (provision of CRP tests with additional healthcare worker guidance) and 24 facilities acting as controls (routine care). Comparison between the treatment arms will be through logistic regression, with the treatment assignment as a fixed effect, and the CHC as a random effect. With 48 clusters, an average of 10 consultations per facility per week will result in approximately 520 over 1 year, and 24 960 in total (12 480 per arm). We will be able to detect a reduction of 12% to 23% or more in immediate antibiotic prescription as a result of the CRP POC intervention. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patient consultations for ARI resulting in immediate antibiotic prescription. Secondary endpoints include the proportion of all patients receiving an antibiotic prescription regardless of ARI diagnosis, frequency of re-consultation, subsequent antibiotic use when antibiotics are not prescribed, referral and hospitalisation. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was approved by the Oxford University Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OxTREC, Reference: 53–18), and the ethical committee of the National Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Vietnam (Reference:07/HDDD-NDTW/2019).

296170,wy9q7txv,,WHO,The sweat glands' maximum ion reabsorption rates following heat acclimation in healthy older adults,,,,unk,"NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question to this study? Do the sweat glands' maximum ion reabsorption rates increase following heat acclimation in healthy older individuals and is this associated with elevated aldosterone concentrations? What is the main finding and its importance? Sweat gland maximum ion reabsorption rates improved heterogeneously across body sites, which occurred without any changes in aldosterone concentration following a controlled hyperthermic heat acclimation protocol in healthy older individuals. ABSTRACT: We examined whether the eccrine sweat glands' ion reabsorption rates improved following heat acclimation (HA) in older individuals. Ten healthy older adults (>65 years) completed a controlled hyperthermic (+0.9°C rectal temperature, Tre ) HA protocol for nine non-consecutive days. Participants completed a passive heat stress test (lower leg 42°C water submersion) pre-HA and post-HA to assess physiological regulation of sweat gland ion reabsorption at the chest, forearm and thigh. The maximum ion reabsorption rate was defined as the inflection point in the slope of the relation between galvanic skin conductance and sweat rate (SR). We explored the responses again after a 7-day decay. During passive heating, the Tb thresholds for sweat onset on the chest and forearm were lowered after HA (P < 0.05). However, sweat sensitivity (i.e. the slope), the SR at a given Tre and gross sweat loss did not improve after HA (P > 0.05). Any changes observed were lost during the decay. Pilocarpine-induced sudomotor responses to iontophoresis did not change after HA (P &#8805; 0.801). Maximum ion reabsorption rate was only enhanced at the chest (P = 0.001) despite unaltered aldosterone concentration after HA. The data suggest that this adaptation is lost after 7 days' decay. The HA protocol employed in the present study induced partial adaptive sudomotor responses. Eccrine sweat gland ion reabsorption rates improved heterogeneously across the skin sites. It is likely that aldosterone secretion did not alter the chest sweat ion reabsorption rates observed in the older adults.",2020,"Gerrett, Nicola; Amano, Tatsuro; Inoue, Yoshimitsu; Kondo, Narihiko",Exp. physiol,,#33006218,,,,,222161390.0

In terms of breast cancer care, this has led to a restricted provision of reconstruction with autologous free tissue transfer. A primary concern is the risk of mortality in elective surgery patients who develop COVID-19. The aim of this report is to describe the observed physiological impact of the virus on our patient, and to address how outpatient care after autologous free tissue transfer can be delivered to COVID-19 positive patients. In March 2020, we performed a bilateral breast reconstruction with a deep inferior epigastric perforator flap and a superficial inferior epigastric perforator flap. The patient became symptomatic on day three post-operatively, tested positive for COVID-19 and was discharged home. Drain and dressing management was continued through the use of telemedicine. Two weeks following the operation, a breast seroma formed that was drained semi-electively in the COVID-19 positive area of the Emergency Department. The patient visited the dressing clinic twice in total and healed after three weeks. Despite undergoing complex surgery and having pre-operative chemotherapy, our patient suffered a mild form of the virus limited to upper respiratory symptoms. Physiologically we did not see any significant difference to that of the normal post-operative course. This case demonstrates the possibility of managing autologous breast reconstruction patients using telemedicine. Although COVID-19 can complicate, or even be fatal, in the perioperative course, our patient thankfully suffered no discernable negative outcome from her infection.",2020,"Sharp, O; Masud, D",J. plast. reconstr. aesthet. surg,,#912072,,,,,226274090.0

We fitted the meteorological data and influenza mortality data from 2002 to 2009 in a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model. From the results, air temperature was a common significant driver of seasonal patterns and cold temperature was associated with an increase in transmission intensity for most of the influenza epidemics.

Concentrations varied with substantial differences among pollutants and also among the three studied monitoring stations. CO levels showed the most significant reductions (30.3-48.5%) since they were related to light-duty vehicular emissions. NO2 also showed reductions while PM10 levels were only reduced in the first lockdown week. In April, an increase in vehicular flux and movement of people was observed mainly as a consequence of the lack of consensus about the importance and need of social distancing and lockdown. Ozone concentrations increased probably due to the decrease in nitrogen oxides level. When comparing with the same period of 2019, NO2 and CO median values were 24.1-32.9 and 37.0-43.6% lower.

A recent unbiased genomics-guided tracing of the SARS-CoV-2 targets in human cells identified vitamin D among the three top-scoring molecules manifesting potential infection mitigation patterns. Growing pre-clinical and epidemiological observational data support this assumption. We hypothesized that vitamin D supplementation may improve the prognosis of COVID-19. The aim of this trial is to compare the effect of a single oral high dose of cholecalciferol versus a single oral standard dose on all-cause 14-day mortality rate in COVID-19 older adults at higher risk of worsening. METHODS: The COVIT-TRIAL study is an open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled superiority trial. Patients aged &#8805; 65 years with COVID-19 (diagnosed within the preceding 3 days with RT-PCR and/or chest CT scan) and at least one worsening risk factor at the time of inclusion (i.e., age &#8805; 75 years, or SpO2 &#8804; 94% in room air, or PaO2/FiO2 &#8804; 300 mmHg), having no contraindications to vitamin D supplementation, and having received no vitamin D supplementation > 800 IU/day during the preceding month are recruited. Participants are randomized either to high-dose cholecalciferol (two 200,000 IU drinking vials at once on the day of inclusion) or to standard-dose cholecalciferol (one 50,000 IU drinking vial on the day of inclusion). Two hundred sixty participants are recruited and followed up for 28 days. The primary outcome measure is all-cause mortality within 14 days of inclusion. Secondary outcomes are the score changes on the World Health Organization Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement (OSCI) scale for COVID-19, and the between-group comparison of safety. These outcomes are assessed at baseline, day 14, and day 28, together with the serum concentrations of 25(OH)D, creatinine, calcium, and albumin at baseline and day 7. DISCUSSION: COVIT-TRIAL is to our knowledge the first randomized controlled trial testing the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the prognosis of COVID-19 in high-risk older patients. High-dose vitamin D supplementation may be an effective, well-tolerated, and easily and immediately accessible treatment for COVID-19, the incidence of which increases dramatically and for which there are currently no scientifically validated treatments.

However, the results of studies on the effect of COVID-19 on male reproduction are controversial. OBJECTIVE: To summarize current research on the effects of COVID-19 on male reproduction. METHODS: A systematic review of English literature was performed using PubMed and Ovid Embase up to August 18, 2020. Research articles on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen, the effects of the virus on semen parameters, and any pathological changes in the testes were evaluated. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included in this review. Six of 176 survivors (3.4%) and 1 of 13 decedents (7.7%) in 2 of 12 studies were positive for viral RNA in semen and testicular tissue, respectively. After stratification of patient groups, we found that the virus was detected in the relatively early stage of infection, 6-16 days after disease onset, in semen from survivors. Two of 3 studies reported that some participants had substandard semen quality after COVID-19, and 1 study found that COVID-19 may impair semen quality in a severity-related manner. Pathological analyses showed that injuries to the seminiferous tubule occurred in all decedents (N=11). Another study found that orchitic and testis fibrin microthrombi occurred in patients with fatal disease (100%, N=2). Scrotal discomfort of orchiepididymitis or spermatic cord inflammation has also been reported in COVID-19 patients.

The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), adapts and evolves rapidly in nature. With the availability of 16,092 SARS‐CoV‐2 full genomes in GISAID as of 13 May, we removed the poor‐quality genomes and performed mutational profiling analysis for the remaining 11,183 viral genomes. Global analysis of all sequences identified all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the whole genome and critical SNPs with high mutation frequency that contributes to five‐clade classification of global strains. A total of 119 SNPs were found with 74 non‐synonymous mutations, 43 synonymous mutations and two mutations in intergenic regions. Analysis of geographic pattern of mutational profiling for the whole genome reveals differences between each continent. A transition mutation from C to T represents the most mutation types across the genome, suggesting rapid evolution and adaptation of the virus in host. Amino acid (AA) deletions and insertions found across the genome results in changes in viral protein length and potential function alteration. Mutational profiling for each gene was analysed, and results show that nucleocapsid gene demonstrates the highest mutational frequency, followed by Nsp2, Nsp3 and Spike gene.

Understanding the taxonomic profile of microorganisms in the impacted systems is required to establish taxa that are bio-indicators of toxicants, and provide possible taxa for mitigating ecotoxicity of the HWWs. Geochemistry, pollution status and ecotoxicity of heavy metals (HMs) in HWW-impacted sewer (LU) were assessed. The microbiome profiling was based on 16S rDNA and ITS of 18S rDNA metagenomes. The degree of HMs contamination exceeded 50 and HMs pollution load index of LU was severe (1,084), which consequently exerted severe risk (1,411,575 toxic response factors) with very high toxic responses of Co, Cu, Pb, and Cd. Eco-toxicological impact of the HMs on LU skewed microbiome towards Proteobacteria (43%), Actinobacteria (18%), and about 5% apiece for Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Plantomycetes, and Bacteroidetes. Likewise, the relative abundance of in LU inclined towards Ascomycota (59%), Basidiomycota (17%) and unclassified Eukarya_uc_p (16%). Exclusively found in LU sediments were 44,862 bacterial species and 42,881 fungi taxa, while 72,877 and 53,971 species of bacteria and fungi, respectively, were found missing. Extinction and emergence of bacteria and fungi taxa in LU were in response to HMs ecotoxicity and the need for natural attenuation processes respectively.

However, the hemodynamic effect of recruitment maneuvers remain poorly documented in this setting. Material and Methods This was a prospective observational study performed in operating theatre including patients scheduled for major vascular surgery. Patients were monitored with invasive arterial pressure and esophageal doppler. After induction of general anesthesia, before surgery began, preload optimization based on stroke volume (SV) variation following fluid challenge was performed. Then, an alveolar recruitment maneuver (ARM) through stepwise increase in positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was performed. Hemodynamic data were noted before, during, and after the alveolar recruitment maneuver. Results ARM through stepwise increase in PEEP and CPAP were applied in 22 and 14 preload independent patients, respectively. Relative changes in SV during ARMs were significantly greater in the ARMCPAP group (-39 ± 20%) as compared to the ARMPEEP group (-15 ± 22%; P = 0.002). The difference (95% CI) in relative decrease in SV between ARMCPAP and ARMPEEP groups was -24% (-38 to -9; P = 0.001). Changes in arterial pressure, cardiac index, pulse pressure variation, peak velocity, and corrected flow time measures were not different between groups. Conclusion During anesthesia, in preload independent patients, ARMs through CPAP resulted in a significantly greater decrease in SV than stepwise increase in PEEP.

These tools have grown in use together with the rise in enrollments in computer science programs and the widespread availability of code on-line. Educators rely on the robustness of plagiarism detection tools; the working assumption is that the effort required to evade detection is as high as that required to actually do the assigned work. This paper shows this is not the case. It presents an entirely automatic program transformation approach, Mossad, that defeats popular software plagiarism detection tools. Mossad comprises a framework that couples techniques inspired by genetic programming with domain-specific knowledge to effectively undermine plagiarism detectors. Mossad is effective at defeating four plagiarism detectors, including Moss and JPlag. Mossad is both fast and effective: it can, in minutes, generate modified versions of programs that are likely to escape detection. More insidiously, because of its non-deterministic approach, Mossad can, from a single program, generate dozens of variants, which are classified as no more suspicious than legitimate assignments. A detailed study of Mossad across a corpus of real student assignments demonstrates its efficacy at evading detection. A user study shows that graduate student assistants consistently rate Mossad-generated code as just as readable as authentic student code. This work motivates the need for both research on more robust plagiarism detection tools and greater integration of naturally plagiarism-resistant methodologies like code review into computer science education.",2020-10-04,"Devore-McDonald, Breanna; Berger, Emery D.",,,,2010.01700,document_parses/pdf_json/12d0b223bdf3387a692f8b9de7d61faad8328f5b.json,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01700v1.pdf,222132841.0

Therefore, there is a dire need to develop antiviral agents for the treatment of ALV infections and RNA interference (RNAi) is considered an effective antiviral strategy. RESULTS: In this study, the avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) proviral genome, including the gag genes, were treated as targets for RNAi. Four pairs of miRNA sequences were designed and synthesized that targeted different regions of the gag gene. The screened target (i.e., the gag genes) was shown to effectively suppress the replication of ALV-J by 19.0-77.3%. To avoid the generation of escape variants during virus infection, expression vectors of multi-target miRNAs were constructed using the multi-target serial strategy (against different regions of the gag, pol, and env genes). Multi-target miRNAs were shown to play a synergistic role in the inhibition of ALV-J replication, with an inhibition efficiency of viral replication ranging from 85.0-91.2%.

The goal of this study was to indicate transition boundaries from healthy tissue to tumors, namely, hepatic carcinoma, based on the real-time feedback derived from the optical measurements. MATERIALS AND METHODS Five woodchucks with hepatic carcinoma were used for this study. The woodchucks were imaged with contrast-enhanced cone beam computed tomography with a flat panel detector C-arm system to visualize the carcinoma in the liver. In each animal, 3 insertions were performed, starting from the skin surface toward the hepatic carcinoma under image guidance. In 2 woodchucks, each end point of the insertion was confirmed with pathologic examination of a biopsy sample. While advancing the needle in the animals under image guidance such as fluoroscopy overlaid with cone beam computed tomography slice and ultrasound, optical spectra were acquired at the distal end of the needles. Optical tissue characterization was determined by translating the acquired optical spectra into clinical parameters such as blood, water, lipid, and bile fractions; tissue oxygenation levels; and scattering amplitude related to tissue density. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to study the difference in the derived clinical parameters from the measurements performed within the healthy tissue and the hepatic carcinoma. Kurtoses were calculated to assess the dispersion of these parameters within the healthy and carcinoma tissues. RESULTS Blood and lipid volume fractions as well as tissue oxygenation and reduced scattering amplitude showed to be significantly different between the healthy part of the liver and the hepatic carcinoma (P < 0.05) being higher in normal liver tissue. A decrease in blood and lipid volume fractions and tissue oxygenation as well as an increase in scattering amplitude were observed when the tip of the needle crossed the margin from the healthy liver tissue to the carcinoma. The kurtosis for each derived clinical parameter was high in the hepatic tumor as compared with that in the healthy liver indicating intracarcinoma variability. CONCLUSIONS Tissue blood content, oxygenation level, lipid content, and tissue density all showed significant differences when the needle tip was guided from the healthy tissue to the carcinoma and can therefore be used to identify tissue boundaries during percutaneous image-guided interventions.",2015,"Nachabé, Rami; Hendriks, Benno H W; Schierling, Ross; Hales, Jasmine; Racadio, Judy M; Rottenberg, Sven; Ruers, Theo J M; Babic, Drazenko; Racadio, John M",Investigative radiology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1097/rli.0000000000000149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25783227/,41139189.0

Carrying out such war, some governments try to redefine the distinction between the private sphere and the public sphere in their people's lives. Even sexual life, the most private sphere in people's lives, may be exposed to various forms of supervision and control from their states in the name of the national ""war effort."" In particular, the government in war does not hesitate to scrutinize the most private sphere of their people's lives when certain aspects of their lives do considerable harm to ""war effort"" or ""national efficiency."" The British society in the First World War intensively experienced some kind of ""social control"" due to the increasing spread of venereal disease (VD) both among civilians and troops. Like British society as a whole, the British army, who had primary responsibility to fight the war in the field, had to fight another hard battle against an enemy within VD, throughout the war. During the First World War, VD caused 416,891 hospital admissions among British and Dominion troops. Excluding readmissions for relapses, approximately five percent of all the men who served in Britain's armies in the course of the war became infected. During the war, at least a division was constantly out of action because so many troops had to treat VD. This disease caused a huge drain on the British army's human and material resources and consequently undermined, to a considerable extent, its military efficiency. However, a series of measures of the British Army to improve the high rate of infection among their troops have been simply considered ineffective by both contemporaries and subsequent researchers. This article aims to provide a more balanced perspective on the efforts of the British Army to fight VD during the war and reconsider the existing understandings in regard to their general effectiveness. It argues that the overall measures of the British Army regarding VD have to be examined in the context of the national efforts of British society to fight against VD as a whole. Their supposed ineffectiveness well-reflected the indecisiveness of the overall British society in terms of both how to view VD and how to fight against it.",2020,"Kang, Changboo",Uisahak,,#32937645,,,,,221769024.0

In this study, we compared the capacity of porcine IFN-alpha, -beta and -gamma, or a combination of them, to protect IBRS-2 cells (porcine kidney cells) from infection with pseudorabies virus (PRV). The results demonstrated that porcine IFN-beta (PoIFN-beta) was the most efficient of the three IFNs in conferring resistance PRV infection; 100 U/mL PoIFN-beta inhibited PRV plaque formation 5.3-fold. Compared with PoIFN-beta, porcine IFN-gamma (PoIFN-gamma) was less capable of inhibiting PRV plaque formation (3.3-fold inhibition). Porcine IFN-alpha (PoIFN-alpha) had the least capability of the three PoIFNs, and inhibited PRV plaque formation only 1.26-fold. The inhibitory capacity increased to only 2.3-fold with a treatment of 12,800 U/mL PoIFN-alpha. A combination of PoIFN-gamma and PoIFN-alpha or PoIFN-beta inhibited PRV plaque formation 12.8-fold or 100-fold, respectively. Treatment of IBRS-2 cells with PoIFN-alpha/beta and PoIFN-gamma inhibited PRV replication 29- or 146-fold. Additionally, real-time PCR analyses of the PRV immediate early (IE) gene revealed that IE mRNA expression was profoundly decreased in cells stimulated with PoIFN-alpha/beta and PoIFN-gamma (23.8-133.0-fold) compared with vehicle-treated cells. All the findings indicate that PoIFN-gamma acts synergistically with other PoIFNs (PoIFN-alpha and -beta) to potently inhibit PRV replication in vitro.",2007,"Yao, Qingxia; Qian, Ping; Cao, Yi; He, Yannan; Si, Youhui; Xu, Zhuofei; Chen, Huanchun",European cytokine network,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17594939/,26212850.0

The objective of our study is to understand the current status of hospitals preparedness for infectious disease outbreaks in Beijing and to provide basic information for infectious disease prevention and control in hospitals. Methods One hundred fifty-two secondary and tertiary care hospitals in Beijing were surveyed by a standardized questionnaire. Data related to hospital demographic information and their emergency plans, laboratory diagnosis capacity, medical treatment procedures for infectious diseases, stockpiles of drugs and personal protective equipment, and staff training were collected. Results Responses were received from 134 (88.2%) of the 152 hospitals surveyed. Overall, hospitals reported that the number of physicians and nurses in infectious disease accounted for only 1.8% of the total physicians and 2.5% of the total nurses, and surgery beds accounted for 8.5% of all the fixed beds. Approximately 93.3% of the hospitals surveyed reported that they had an emergency plan, and none of those reported that their laboratories were able to isolate and identify all 8 kinds of common pathogens of infectious diseases: 22.4% of the hospitals had medical treatment procedures for all these infectious diseases, 23.1% had stored specific drugs for treatment, 2.2% had all personal protective equipment, and 30.6% reported that their health care staff had been trained in hospital emergency preparedness for infectious diseases. In general, emergency preparedness for infectious diseases in tertiary care hospitals was better than that in secondary care hospitals; the preparedness at general hospitals was better than that at specialized hospitals; and that at teaching hospitals was better than that at nonteaching hospitals. Conclusion Emergency preparedness for infectious disease at hospitals in Beijing was in an early stage of development during this survey.

The solar system is littered, however, with distorted polyhedra-shards of rock and ice produced by ubiquitous fragmentation. We apply the theory of convex mosaics to show that the average geometry of natural two-dimensional (2D) fragments, from mud cracks to Earth's tectonic plates, has two attractors: ""Platonic"" quadrangles and ""Voronoi"" hexagons. In three dimensions (3D), the Platonic attractor is dominant: Remarkably, the average shape of natural rock fragments is cuboid. When viewed through the lens of convex mosaics, natural fragments are indeed geometric shadows of Plato's forms. Simulations show that generic binary breakup drives all mosaics toward the Platonic attractor, explaining the ubiquity of cuboid averages.

A growing body of basic science, clinical research, and population health evidence points to the benefits of healthy behaviors, environments and policies to maintain health and prevent, treat, and reverse the root causes of common chronic diseases. Similarly, innovations in research methodologies, standards of evidence, emergence of unique study cohorts, and breakthroughs in data analytics and modeling create new possibilities for producing biomedical knowledge and clinical translation. To understand these advances and inform future directions research, The Lifestyle Medicine Research Summit was convened at the University of Pittsburgh on December 4–5, 2019. The Summit's goal was to review current status and define research priorities in the six core areas of lifestyle medicine: plant-predominant nutrition, physical activity, sleep, stress, addictive behaviors, and positive psychology/social connection. Forty invited subject matter experts (1) reviewed existing knowledge and gaps relating lifestyle behaviors to common chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, many cancers, inflammatory- and immune-related disorders and other conditions; and (2) discussed the potential for applying cutting-edge molecular, cellular, epigenetic and emerging science knowledge and computational methodologies, research designs, and study cohorts to accelerate clinical applications across all six domains of lifestyle medicine. Notably, federal health agencies, such as the Department of Defense and Veterans Administration have begun to adopt “whole-person health and performance” models that address these lifestyle and environmental root causes of chronic disease and associated morbidity, mortality, and cost. Recommendations strongly support leveraging emerging research methodologies, systems biology, and computational modeling in order to accelerate effective clinical and population solutions to improve health and reduce societal costs. New and alternative hierarchies of evidence are also be needed in order to assess the quality of evidence and develop evidence-based guidelines on lifestyle medicine. Children and underserved populations were identified as prioritized groups to study. The COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately impacts people with chronic diseases that are amenable to effective lifestyle medicine interventions, makes the Summit's findings and recommendations for future research particularly timely and relevant.",2020-12-22,"Vodovotz, Yoram; Barnard, Neal; Hu, Frank B.; Jakicic, John; Lianov, Liana; Loveland, David; Buysse, Daniel; Szigethy, Eva; Finkel, Toren; Sowa, Gwendolyn; Verschure, Paul; Williams, Kim; Sanchez, Eduardo; Dysinger, Wayne; Maizes, Victoria; Junker, Caesar; Phillips, Edward; Katz, David; Drant, Stacey; Jackson, Richard J.; Trasande, Leonardo; Woolf, Steven; Salive, Marcel; South-Paul, Jeannette; States, Sarah L.; Roth, Loren; Fraser, Gary; Stout, Ron; Parkinson, Michael D.",Front Med (Lausanne),,,,document_parses/pdf_json/e2788f08adbcc6c94bceb9caa7ed13b6b03bbfd8.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7783318.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33415115/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.585744,229344634.0

We also compared the number of consultations and non-attendances with the pre-COVID era. Seventy percent of patients replied to the questionnaire, and 79% wanted to continue with telephone appointments. Eighty-two percent felt that despite COVID-19, their urological care was unaffected. Generally, the reason that telephone appointments were unacceptable for patients was a preference for face-to-face interaction. The majority expressed a lack of enthusiasm for potential video consultations with only 43% interested in this. Over 95% of patients who required investigations still had these tests performed. There was a reduction in patients who 'did not attend (DNAs)' from 7.5% prior to COVID-19 to 3% during the peak of the pandemic.

While elective activity has halted across the board nationally, the slow plateau of COVID-19 case rates is prompting the question of timing of resumption of clinical activity. We sought to prospectively predict geographical “hot zones” for otolaryngological exposure to COVID-19 based on procedural volumes data from 2013 to 2017. METHODS: Otolaryngologic CPT codes were stratified based on risk-level, according to recently published specialty-specific guidelines. Using the Medicare POSPUF database, aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) were mapped based on hospital referral regions, against up-to-date COVID-19 case distribution data, as of April 24, 2020. RESULTS: The most common AGPs were diagnostic flexible laryngoscopy, diagnostic nasal endoscopy, and flexible laryngoscopy with stroboscopy. The regions with the most AGPs per otolaryngologist were Iowa City, IA, Detroit, MI, and Burlington, VT, while the states with the most COVID-19 cases as of April 24th are New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides a model for predicting possible “hot zones” for otolaryngologic exposure based on both COVID-19 case density and AGP-density.

Plastic mulching (PM) is widely used in China aiming to the increase of crop productivity. However, the impact of PM on reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions and nitrogen (N) footprint has not been explicitly described. In this study, we collected 4051 observations from 394 published papers for potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and used meta-analysis to investigate how PM affected crop yield, net economic return, Nr emissions, and N footprints including nitrogen footprint per unit of output energy (NFo) and nitrogen footprint per unit of net economic return (NFe) at regional scale and across a range of precipitation and N fertilization gradients in China. The meta-analysis showed that compared to non-PM practice, PM increased grain yield by 25, 27, and 20% in potato, maize, and wheat, respectively, and enhanced net economic return by 19, 29, and 22%, respectively, with corresponding reduction in NFo of 24, 36, and 18% and NFe of 19, 37, and 19%, respectively. Potato and maize had greater energy output and net economic return than wheat. Plastic mulching was more effective in improving net economic return (or energy output) and reducing N footprints (i.e., NFe and NFo) in the semiarid region (i.e., annual precipitation <600 mm) when N was applied at 100-200 kg N ha-1, especially in potato and maize. Our analysis suggests that the use of PM enhanced grain yield and net economic return while lowering the N footprint without increasing Nr emission. Therefore, PM has great potential to mitigate Nr loss in China when crop species, N fertilization rate, and local environmental factors (i.e., growing region and annual precipitation) are appropriately considered.",2020-08-06,"Wang, Linlin; Coulter, Jeffrey A; Li, Lingling; Luo, Zhuzhu; Chen, Yinglong; Deng, Xiping; Xie, Junhong",The Science of the total environment,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141479; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818896/,221220556.0

This analysis was aimed at tracing a trend related to death counts expected at the 5th and 6th week of the COVID-19 in India. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Validated database was used to procure global and Indian data related to coronavirus and related outcomes. Multiple regression and linear regression analyses were used interchangeably. Since the week 6 death count data was not correlated significantly with any of the chosen inputs, an auto-regression technique was employed to improve the predictive ability of the regression model. RESULTS: A linear regression analysis predicted average week 5 death count to be 211 with a 95% CI: 1.31–2.60). Similarly, week 6 death count, in spite of a strong correlation with input variables, did not pass the test of statistical significance. Using auto-regression technique and using week 5 death count as input the linear regression model predicted week 6 death count in India to be 467, while keeping at the back of our mind the risk of over-estimation by most of the risk-based models.

While neonates are a special population, little is known about the neonatal outcomes. This study aimed to investigate the outcomes in COVID-19 positive neonates and incidence of vertical transmission of the virus by reviewing available literature. Study Design This study is a narrative review of available literature on “COVID-19 in neonates,” for which PubMed and Google Scholar were used to search the published articles. Results We summarized the data from 39 published studies that are comprised of 326 COVID-19 positive peripartum mothers with respective neonatal outcomes. Twenty-three neonates have been reported to be COVID-19 positive. Male neonates were affected significantly more (79%) than female neonates. Approximately 3% neonates acquired infection through suspected vertical transmission. Strict infection prevention measures during the perinatal time can significantly reduce the chance of horizontal transmission of the virus. Overall, neonates were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic regardless of gestational age at birth and required only supportive measures. There was 0% mortality in COVID-19 positive neonates. Conclusion From available published data to date, we can conclude that the prognosis of COVID-19 positive neonates is good with no mortality. There appears to be minimal vertical transmission of the infection. Key Points: Majority of COVID-19 positive neonates showed mild clinical signs and symptoms with no mortality. Most COVID-19 positive neonates require only supportive measures.

Measures have been taken to reduce the spread of the virus, including school closures and widespread lockdowns. Physical isolation combined with economic instability, fear of infection, and uncertainty for the future has had a profound impact on global mental health. For adolescents, the effects of this stress may be heightened due to important developmental characteristics. Canadian adolescents (n = 1,054; M age= 16.68, SD = 0.78) completed online surveys and responded to questions on stress surrounding the COVID-19 crisis, feelings of loneliness and depression, as well as time spent with family, virtually with friends, doing schoolwork, using social media, and engaging in physical activity. Results showed that adolescents are very concerned about the COVID-19 crisis and are particularly worried about schooling and peer relationships. COVID-19 stress was related to more loneliness and more depression, especially for adolescents who spend more time on social media. Beyond COVID-19 stress, more time connecting to friends virtually during the pandemic was related to greater depression, but family time and schoolwork was related to less depression. For adolescents with depressive symptoms, it may be important to monitor the supportiveness of online relationships. Results show promising avenues to stave off loneliness, as time with family, time connecting to friends, as well as physical activity were related to lower loneliness, beyond COVID-19 stress.

Although not much was known about the new virus, the first outbreaks in China and Italy showed that potentially a large number of people worldwide could fall critically ill in a short period of time. A shortage of ventilators and intensive care resources was expected in many countries, leading to concerns about restrictions of medical care and preventable deaths. In order to be prepared for this challenging situation, national triage guidance has been developed or adapted from former influenza pandemic guidelines in an increasing number of countries over the past few months. In this article, we provide a comparative analysis of triage recommendations from selected national and international professional societies, including Australia/New Zealand, Belgium, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Pakistan, South Africa, Switzerland, the United States, and the International Society of Critical Care Medicine. We describe areas of consensus, including the importance of prognosis, patient will, transparency of the decision-making process, and psychosocial support for staff, as well as the role of justice and benefit maximization as core principles. We then probe areas of disagreement, such as the role of survival versus outcome, long-term versus short-term prognosis, the use of age and comorbidities as triage criteria, priority groups and potential tiebreakers such as 'lottery' or 'first come, first served'. Having explored a number of tensions in current guidance, we conclude with a suggestion for framework conditions that are clear, consistent and implementable.

While sickness and the need for transfusions are very much in place, the gap of demand against blood collection has widened. Additionally, with the monsoon season at hand, and the categorical challenges of a dengue outbreak, the subsequent need for blood components especially the platelet concentrates is going to rise. Some of the criteria laid for deferring a blood donor from his or her WBD need a categorical revision, considering these unprecedented times. We, therefore, critically analyzed the blood donor selection criteria and hereby, suggest an updating regarding the pre-donation haemoglobin, sexually transmitted diseases, lactation, pregnancy and many such subheadings.

Study design Prospective cohort study conducted from January 15, 2012 to January 31, 2013. Infants in the NICU were enrolled if they were inborn, had never been discharged home, and were evaluated for sepsis (at >72 hours of age) and antibiotic therapy was initiated. Infants had a nasopharyngeal specimen collected for detection of respiratory viruses by multiplex polymerase chain reaction within 72 hours of the initiation of antibiotic therapy. Their medical records were reviewed for demographic, clinical, radiographic, and laboratory data until NICU discharge. Results During the 13-month study, 8 of 100 infants, or 8 (6%) of the 135 sepsis evaluations, had a respiratory virus detected by polymerase chain reaction (2, enterovirus/rhinovirus; 2, rhinovirus; 2, coronaviruses; and 2, parainfluenza-3 virus).

Infection rates among employees are infrequently described. OBJECTIVE: To describe SARS-CoV-2 rates among SNF employees and residents during a non-outbreak time period, we measured cross-sectional SARS-CoV-2 prevalence across multiple sites in the Seattle area. DESIGN: SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed for SNF employees and residents using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. A subset of employees completed a sociodemographic and symptom questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS: Between March 29 and May 13, 2020, we tested 1583 employees and 1208 residents at 16 SNFs for SARS-CoV-2. MAIN MEASURE: SARS-CoV-2 testing results and symptom report among employees and residents. KEY RESULTS: Eleven of the 16 SNFs had one or more resident or employee test positive. Overall, 46 (2.9%) employees had positive or inconclusive testing for SARS-CoV-2, and among those who completed surveys, most were asymptomatic and involved in direct patient care. The majority of employees tested were female (934, 73%), and most employees were Asian (392, 30%), Black (360, 28%), or white (360, 28%). Among the 1208 residents tested, 110 (9.1%) had positive or inconclusive results. There was no association between the presence of positive residents and positive employees within a SNF (p = 0.62, McNemar's test).

They are abundant in the human peripheral blood and also enriched in mucosal layers and in the lungs, SARS-CoV-2's main ports of entry. Once activated, MAIT cells produce inflammatory cytokines and cytolytic effector molecules quickly and copiously. MAIT cells are best known for their antibacterial and antifungal properties. However, they are also activated during viral infections, typically in a cytokine-dependent manner, which may promote antiviral immunity. On the other hand, it is plausible to assume active roles for MAIT cells in infection-provoked cytokine storms and tissue damage. SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic, mild, severe, or even fatal, depending on sex, age, the presence of preexisting morbidities, and the individual's immunological competence, or lack thereof, among other factors. Based on the available literature, I propose that MAIT cells regulate the host response to SARS-CoV-2 and constitute attractive targets in the prevention or clinical management of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and some of its complications. Unlike mainstream T cells, MAIT cells are restricted by a monomorphic antigen-presenting molecule called MHC-related protein 1 (MR1).

Therefore, the identification of the causative viruses and bacteria is only feasible using multiplex PCR or several monoplex PCR tests in parallel. METHODS: The analytical sensitivity of three multiplex PCR assays, RespiFinder-19, RespiFinder-SMART-22 and xTAG-Respiratory-Virus-Panel-Fast-Assay (RVP), were compared to monoplex real-time PCR with quantified standardized control material. All assays include the most common respiratory pathogens. RESULTS: To compare the analytical sensitivity of the multiplex assays, samples were inoculated with 13 different quantified viruses in the range of 10(1) to 10(5) copies/ml. Concordant results were received for rhinovirus, whereas the RVP detected influenzavirus, RSV and hMPV more frequently in low concentrations. The RespiFinder-19 and the RespiFinder-SMART-22 showed a higher analytical sensitivity for adenoviruses and coronaviruses, whereas the RVP was incapable to detect adenovirus and coronavirus in concentrations of 10(4) copies/ml. The RespiFinder-19 and RespiFinder-SMART-22A did not detect influenzaviruses (10(4) copies/ml) and RSV (10(3) copies/ml). The detection of all 13 viruses in one sample was only achieved using monoplex PCR. To analyze possible competitive amplification reactions between the different viruses, samples were further inoculated with only 4 different viruses in one sample. Compared to the detection of 13 viruses in parallel, only a few differences were found. The incidence of respiratory viruses was compared in tracheal secretion (TS) samples (n = 100) of mechanically ventilated patients in winter (n = 50) and summer (n = 50). In winter, respiratory viruses were detected in 32 TS samples (64%) by RespiFinder-19, whereas the detection rate with RVP was only 22%. The most frequent viruses were adenovirus (32%) and PIV-2 (20%). Multiple infections were detected in 16 TS samples (32%) by RespiFinder-19. Fewer infections were found in summer (RespiFinder-19: 20%; RVP: 6%). All positive results were verified using monoplex PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Multiplex PCR tests have a broad spectrum of pathogens to test at a time.

During viral encephalomyelitis, the absence of CD4 T cells decreases CD8 T cell activity and impedes viral control in the central nervous system (CNS). By contrast, the absence of B7-H1 enhances CD8 T-cell function and accelerates viral control, but increases morbidity. However, the relative contribution of CD4 T cells to CD8 function in the CNS, in the absence of B7-H1, remains unclear. METHODS: Wild-type (WT) and B7-H1(−/−) mice were infected with a gliatropic coronavirus and CD4 T cells depleted to specifically block T helper function in the CNS. Flow cytometry and gene expression analysis of purified T-cell populations from lymph nodes and the CNS was used to directly monitor ex vivo T-cell effector function. The biological affects of altered T-cell responses were evaluated by analysis of viral control and spinal-cord pathology. RESULTS: Increased anti-viral activity by CD8 T cells in the CNS of B7-H1(−/−) mice was lost upon depletion of CD4 T cells; however, despite concomitant loss of viral control, the clinical disease was less severe. CD4 depletion in B7-H1(−/−) mice also decreased inducible nitric oxide synthase expression by microglia and macrophages, consistent with decreased microglia/macrophage activation and reduced interferon (IFN)-γ. Enhanced production of IFN-γ, interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-21 mRNA was seen in CD4 T cells from infected B7-H1(−/−) compared with WT mice, suggesting that over-activated CD4 T cells primarily contribute to the increased pathology. CONCLUSIONS: The local requirement of CD4 T-cell help for CD8 T-cell function is not overcome if B7-H1 inhibitory signals are lost. Moreover, the increased effector activity by CD8 T cells in the CNS of B7-H1(−/−) mice is attributable not only to the absence of B7-H1 upregulation on major histocompatibility complex class I-presenting resident target cells, but also to enhanced local CD4 T-cell function. B7-H1-mediated restraint of CD4 T-cell activity is thus crucial to dampen both CD8 T-cell function and microglia/macrophage activation, thereby providing protection from T-cell-mediated bystander damage.",2012-12-14,"Phares, Timothy W; Stohlman, Stephen A; Hinton, David R; Bergmann, Cornelia C",J Neuroinflammation,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c59d6e789176b928523129adb96ca495720a3b4a.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3545890.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-2094-9-269; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23237504/,3264205.0

To initiate replication, viruses have developed powerful evasion strategies to counteract host IFN responses. In the present study, we found that the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) NS5 protein could inhibit double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-induced IFN-β expression in a dose-dependent manner. Our data further demonstrated that JEV NS5 suppressed the activation of the IFN transcriptional factors IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NF-κB. However, there was no defect in the phosphorylation of IRF3 and degradation of IκB, an upstream inhibitor of NF-κB, upon NS5 expression, indicating a direct inhibition of the nuclear localization of IRF3 and NF-κB by NS5. Mechanistically, NS5 was shown to interact with the nuclear transport proteins KPNA2, KPNA3, and KPNA4, which competitively blocked the interaction of KPNA3 and KPNA4 with their cargo molecules, IRF3 and p65, a subunit of NF-κB, and thus inhibited the nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-κB. Furthermore, overexpression of KPNA3 and KPNA4 restored the activity of IRF3 and NF-κB and increased the production of IFN-β in NS5-expressing or JEV-infected cells. Additionally, an upregulated replication level of JEV was shown upon KPNA3 or KPNA4 overexpression. These results suggest that JEV NS5 inhibits the induction of type I IFN by targeting KPNA3 and KPNA4.IMPORTANCE JEV is the major cause of viral encephalitis in South and Southeast Asia, with high mortality. However, the molecular mechanisms contributing to the severe pathogenesis are poorly understood. The ability of JEV to counteract the host innate immune response is potentially one of the mechanisms responsible for JEV virulence. Here we demonstrate the ability of JEV NS5 to interfere with the dsRNA-induced nuclear translocation of IRF3 and NF-κB by competitively inhibiting the interaction of IRF3 and NF-κB with nuclear transport proteins. Via this mechanism, JEV NS5 suppresses the induction of type I IFN and the antiviral response in host cells. These findings reveal a novel strategy for JEV to escape the host innate immune response and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of JEV.",2017,"Ye, Jing; Chen, Zheng; Li, Yunchuan; Zhao, Zikai; He, Wen; Zohaib, Ali; Song, Yunfeng; Deng, Chenglin; Zhang, Bo; Chen, Huanchun; Cao, Shengbo",Journal of virology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00039-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28179530/,4521740.0

Recently, suture material has been developed characterized by barbs projecting from a monofilament base. Claimed advantages for barbed sutures are a shortened wound closure time and reduced maximum wound tension. It has also been suggested that these sutures would be advantageous microbiologically. The aim of this study was to test the microbiological characteristics of the barbed Quill in comparison to the monofilament Ethilon II and the braided sutures Vicryl and triclosan-coated Vicryl Plus. In our study, sutures were cultivated on color-change agar with Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the halo size was measured. In a second study arm with longer cultivation bacterial growth was followed by antibiotic treatment. Ethilon II and Quill showed good comparable results, whereas large halos were found around Vicryl. Vicryl Plus results depended on triclosan sensitivity. After longer bacterial cultivation and antibiotic treatment, halos were up to 3.6 times smaller on Quill than on Vicryl (p < 0.001), but 1.4 times larger than on Ethilon II (p < 0.001) regarding S. aureus. Confocal microscopy analysis showed bacterial colonization between the braided filaments on Vicryl and beneath the barbs on Quill. From a microbiological perspective, barbed sutures can be recommended in aseptic surgery, but should only be used carefully in septic surgery. © 2016 Orthopaedic Research Society.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 10 female pigs (weight 45 kg) underwent TR (n = 5) or TV (n = 5) NOTES PN. The pneumoperitoneum was created by a periumbilical 12-mm trocar, through which a laparoscope was advanced for intra-abdominal visualization. For TV-NOTES PN, a gastroscope was used to obtain TV peritoneal access. For TR-NOTES PN, a horizontal incision was made 2 cm above the dentate line, and a submucosal tunnel was created in the posterior rectal wall. The gastroscope was advanced through the submucosal tunnel and retroperitoneum to the kidney, and a peritoneal window was created. For both TR- and TV-NOTES PN, the gastroscope was exchanged for the SPIDER Surgical System. Flexible dissecting instruments and hook cautery introduced through the SPIDER Surgical System were used to mobilize the kidney. A harmonic scalpel introduced periumbilically was used to excise a portion of the lower pole. LAPRA-TY-secured sutured renorrhaphy was performed, followed by TR or TV specimen extraction. RESULTS TR- and TV-NOTES PN was successfully performed in all 10 pigs. A comparison of TR- and TV-NOTES PN revealed no significant differences in the mean access time (29.2 vs 29.6 minutes, P = .944), operative time (196.0 vs 183.0 minutes, P = .631), and estimated blood loss (59.0 vs 54.0 mL, P = .861).

Correlation data for proteins and DNA labeled with tetramethylrhodamine were fitted with three to four exponential decays describing flickering dynamics on a time scale between 0.5 and 100 μs. We investigated the nature of these processes by performing experiments under different experimental conditions and for different samples. On the basis of how their population and lifetime change with viscosity, the oxygen content of the solution, the laser irradiance, and the detection geometry, we assigned these states, in the order of increasing lifetimes, to a triplet state, a hybrid between twisted-intramolecular-charge-transfer state and a ground state lactonic state, a lactonic state, and a photoionized state, respectively. Our data suggests that none of the observed sub-diffusion correlation decays can be directly assigned to the intramolecular dynamics of the labeled biomolecules. However, we found evidence that the intrinsic conformational dynamics of the biomolecule appears in the correlation curves as a modulation of the photophysics of the dye label. This shows the importance of accurate control measurements and appropriate modeling of the dye photophysics in fluorescence correlation studies, and it cautions against direct assignments of dark-state relaxation times to folding kinetics in proteins and nucleic acids.",2013,"Mazouchi, Amir; Bahram, Abdullah; Gradinaru, Claudiu C",The journal of physical chemistry.

Our center is located in the south of Italy where the infection rates were low and the clusters of COVID-19 positive patients were small and inhomogeneous. The aim of this short report is to share our experience as a starting point for the management of the steady state of the pandemic. METHODS: The safety of the patients and department staff required a strict plan to minimize the risk of infection between operators whose absence would have made it impossible to carry out the radiotherapy treatments. The head of the radiotherapy unit and members of the Hospital Crisis Unit have put in place a series of measures to manage the emergency. RESULTS: A ""clean"" team has been established whose members are kept out of the radiotherapy unit for 2 weeks on rotation. Several separate work areas have been made in order to reduce direct contact between the staff. Each staff member has to wear protective equipment if close contact with patients is required. Before confirming a radiotherapy consult or a follow-up visit, telephone clinical and epidemiological screening is performed by nurses through a questionnaire regarding the presence of respiratory symptoms or eventual social contacts with COVID-19 positive people. Once the patients arrive in the hospital, a triage point at the entrance to the hospital performs a second screening and a temperature check. CONCLUSIONS: This management experience of a radiotherapy unit in Southern Italy could serve as a useful example for the future. In fact, in the steady state of infection many centers may face epidemiologically contagious numbers similar to those that we currently have in our region. These numbers require the maintenance of alert and precautionary measures which in our case seem to have worked.",2020,"Pezzulla, Donato; Macchia, Gabriella; Taccari, Francesco; Sticca, Giovanna; Deodato, Francesco",Int J Gynecol Cancer,,#375372,,,,,218874133.0

We performed a systematic literature search in December 2015 (updated in December 2016). We included randomised, controlled and cluster-randomised trials of women in labour with planned vaginal delivery receiving patient-controlled remifentanil compared principally with other parenteral and patient-controlled opioids, epidural analgesia and continuous remifentanil infusion or placebo. The primary outcomes were patient satisfaction with pain relief and the occurrence of adverse events for mothers and newborns. We assessed risk of bias for each included study and applied the GRADE approach for the quality of evidence. We included total zero event trials, using a constant continuity correction of 0.01 and a random-effect meta-analysis. Twenty studies were included in the qualitative analysis; within these, 3713 participants were randomised and 3569 analysed. Most of our pre-specified outcomes were not studied in the included trials.

This study examined whether serum Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) level is a useful biomarker for evaluating the severity of COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively examined patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the Japanese Red Cross Medical Center between February 1, 2020, and May 15, 2020. Patients were divided into four categories based on clinical and radiological findings: mild, moderate, severe, and critical. Patients who presented with a mild or moderate illness and patients who started with or worsened to a severe or critical illness were classified as the non-severe and severe groups, respectively. The two groups were compared for patient characteristics, including serum KL-6 levels. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to define the optimum cut-off value of serum KL-6 level to evaluate COVID-19 severity. RESULTS: A total of 54 patients were enrolled, including 33 in the non-severe group and 21 in the severe group, of which four died. Compared with those in the non-severe group, more patients in the severe group were significantly older and had comorbidities. Serum KL-6 levels were significantly higher in the severe group than in the non-severe group both at diagnosis (median, 338 U/mL) and at peak levels within one week after diagnosis (median, 781 U/mL) (both p < 0.001).

We present two simulation-based optimization models for developing dynamic predictive resource distribution strategies for cross-regional pandemic outbreaks. In both models, the underlying simulation mimics the disease and population dynamics of the affected regions. The quantity-based optimization model generates a progressive allocation of limited quantities of mitigation resources, including vaccines, antiviral, administration capacities, and social distancing enforcement resources. The budget-based optimization model strives instead allocating a total resource budget. Both models seek to minimize the impact of ongoing outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks. The models incorporate measures of morbidity, mortality, and social distancing, translated into the societal and economic costs of lost productivity and medical expenses. The models were calibrated using historic pandemic data and implemented on a sample outbreak in Florida, with over four million inhabitants. The quantity-based model was found to be inferior to the budget-based model, which was advantageous in its ability to balance the varying relative cost and effectiveness of individual resources.

The results showed that cloth masks and other fabric materials tested in the study had 40–90% instantaneous penetration levels against polydisperse NaCl aerosols employed in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health particulate respirator test protocol at 5.5 cm s(−1). Similarly, varying levels of penetrations (9–98%) were obtained for different size monodisperse NaCl aerosol particles in the 20–1000 nm range. The penetration levels of these fabric materials against both polydisperse and monodisperse aerosols were much higher than the penetrations for the control N95 respirator filter media. At 16.5 cm s(−1) face velocity, monodisperse aerosol penetrations slightly increased, while polydisperse aerosol penetrations showed no significant effect except one fabric mask with an increase.

In this work, mass spectral profiling, a new tool for data processing is proposed to help a lot in solving this problem as gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy (GC–MS) is used to detect both the active and non-active ingredients buried in HMs. The main idea of mass spectral profiling is employment of target m/z points of GC–MS data on the extraction of chromatographic profiles of pure and/or mixed compositions concerned. Further, the absolute or relative abundance at these m/z points can be utilized for results interpretation. With the help of this tool, the qualitative and quantitative information of chemical components within complicated HMs will be mined out effectively. It can then be recommended as reference indices to assess the importance of target compositions in HMs, such as efficacy evaluation on disease treatment of the active constituents. Mass spectral profiling with less data points significantly improves the possibility to get the rich information with no strong requirements of data preprocessing procedures, like alignment of shift of retention times among different chromatographic profiles. It is powerful for quality control of HMs coupled with pattern recognition techniques on high-throughput data sets. In this study, a commonly used herbal medicine, Houttuynia cordata Thunb and its finished injection products, were used to deliver the strategies. Absolutely, the working principles can be extended to the investigation of metabonomics with gas chromatography–time-of-flight–mass spectrometry (GC–MS–TOF).

The effect of lockdown measures on SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is currently uncertain. In this article, we analyse the effects of the lockdown measures on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in one of the epicentres in SA. OBJECTIVES: To measure the effects of lockdown measures introduced in SA on SARS-CoV-2 attack rates (ARs, the percentage of individuals who tested positive in a specified time period) in Gauteng Province during a 4-month period (March - June 2020). METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we used a comprehensive database from an independent pathology laboratory in Gauteng. We analysed trends of positivity rates of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests done during the 4-month period. The ARs are reported over time (unweighted and age-weighted 14-day moving averages) by age groups, gender, and different regions/districts in Gauteng. RESULTS: A total of 162 528 tests were performed at a private laboratory between 5 March and 30 June 2020, of which 20 574 were positive (overall AR 12.7%). These positive tests constituted 44.8% of all positive cases in the province (20 574/45 944). Sixty-two percent of all tests were done in June during lockdown level 3. There was an exponential increase in the AR in June (18.3%) when lockdown was eased to level 3, in comparison with 4.2% (March), 2.2% (April) and 3.3% (May). The increase in June was seen in all the age groups, although it was more pronounced in the 21 - 60 years age groups than the younger (0 - 20 years) and older (&gt;60 years) age groups. The AR was significantly higher in males (13.2%) compared with females (12.1%) (&#967;2 test, p&lt;0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study testify to the rapid increase in ARs resulting from easing of the lockdown regulations, especially to level 3 in June.

Pollen are documented to invoke strong immune responses and might create an environmental factor that makes it more difficult for flu-like viruses to survive outside a host. This Dutch study confirms that there is a (highly) significant inverse correlation between pollen count and weekly changes in medical flu consults, and that there is a highly significant inverse correlation between hay fever incidence, as measured by prescribed medication revenues, and weekly flu consults. This supports the idea that pollen are a direct or indirect factor in the seasonality of flu-like epidemics.

We aim to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID‐19 children with different severities and allergic status. METHODS: Data extracted from the electronical medical records, including demographics, clinical manifestations, comorbidities, laboratory and immunological results and radiological images of 182 hospitalized COVID‐19 children were summarized and analyzed. RESULTS: The median age was 6 years old, ranging from 3 days to 15 years, and there were more boys (male‐female ratio about 2:1) within the studied 182 patients. Most of the children were infected by family members. Fever (43.4%) and dry cough (44.5%) were common symptoms, and gastrointestinal manifestations accounted for 11.0%, including diarrhea, abdominal discomfort and vomiting. 71.4% had abnormal chest computed tomography (CT) scan images, and typical signs of pneumonia were ground‐glass opacity and local patchy shadowing on admission. Laboratory results were mostly within normal ranges, and only a small ratio of lymphopenia (3.9%) and eosinopenia (29.5%) were observed. The majority (97.8%) of infected children were not severe, and 24 (13.2%) of them had asymptomatic infections. Compared to children without pneumonia(manifested as asymptomatic and acute upper respiratory infection), children with pneumonia were associated with higher percentages of the comorbidity history, symptoms of fever and cough, and increased levels of serum procalcitonin, alkaline phosphatase and serum interleukins (IL)‐2, IL‐4, IL‐6, IL‐10 and TNF‐α.There were no differences of treatments, duration of hospitalization, time from first positive to first negative nucleic acid testing and outcomes between children with mild pneumonia and without pneumonia. All the hospitalized COVID‐19 children had recovered except one death due to intussusception and sepsis.

Demographics and clinical features were not significantly different between allergic and non‐allergic groups. Allergic patients showed less increase in acute phase reactants, procalcitonin, D‐dimer and aspartate aminotransferase levels compared to all patients. Immunological profiles including circulating T, B and NK lymphocyte subsets, total immunoglobulin and complement levels and serum cytokines did not show any difference in allergic and pneumonia groups. Neither eosinophil counts nor serum total immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels showed a significant correlation with other immunological measures, such as other immunoglobulins, complements, lymphocyte subsets numbers and serum cytokine levels. CONCLUSION: Pediatric COVID‐19 patients tended to have a mild clinical course. Patients with pneumonia had higher proportion of fever and cough and increased inflammatory biomarkers than those without pneumonia. There was no difference between allergic and non‐allergic COVID‐19 children in disease incidence, clinical features, laboratory and immunological findings. Allergy was not a risk factor for developing and severity of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and hardly influenced the disease course of COVID‐19 in children.",2020-06-10,"Du, Hui; Dong, Xiang; Zhang, Jin‐jin; Cao, Yi‐yuan; Akdis, Mubeccel; Huang, Pei‐qi; Chen, Hong‐wei; Li, Ying; Liu, Guang‐hui; Akdis, Cezmi A; Lu, Xiao‐xia; Gao, Ya‐dong",Allergy,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/da0505e55b70c7dfcd30a54016957910357548f6.json,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32524611/; https://doi.org/10.1111/all.14452,219587884.0

These challenges occur largely because behavior courses, like most organismal biology courses, often stress experiential learning through laboratories that involve live animals, as well as a lecture component that emphasizes formative assessment, discussion, and critical thinking. Although online behavior courses may be remote, they can still be interactive and social, and designed with inclusive pedagogy. Here, we discuss some of the key decisions that instructors should consider, provide recommendations, and point out new opportunities for student learning that stem directly from the move to online instruction. Specific topics include challenges related to generating an inclusive and engaging online learning environment, synchronous versus asynchronous formats, assignments that enhance student learning, testing format and execution, grade schemes, design of laboratory experiences including opportunities for community science, design of synthetic student projects, and workload balance for students and instructors. We designed this primer both for animal behavior instructors who need to quickly transition to online teaching in the midst of a pandemic, and for those facing such transitions in upcoming terms.

Increased patient access to medical information and education has elicited interest in minimally invasive surgical techniques that obtain improved surgical outcomes and cosmesis. Because of these factors, there is a growing interest in single-incision surgery. Laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) single-incision hernia repair technique has been reported with different meshes used in a tack fixation system. Recently, self-fixating mesh technology has offered the possibility of avoiding tack fixation and potentially avoiding chronic postoperative pain. Self-fixating mesh technology employs monofilament polylactic acid (PLA) creating a microgrip system that provides self-adherence of the mesh to adjacent tissue. This tack-free fixation system provides coverage over the entire myopectineal orifice and surrounding areas where traditional tacks cannot be placed. Self-fixating mesh has also been safely applied in laparoscopic TEP procedures, but this mesh has not been described in single site TEP surgery; possibly because of the potential difficulty with mesh deployment. We sought to determine the technical feasibility of a single-site laparoscopic TEP repair of inguinal hernias and to discuss our techniques and patient short-term outcomes. METHODS Review of a prospectively maintained database of patients who received single-site laparoscopic TEP herniorrhaphy from August 2012 through August 2015. Patient characteristics and demographics and perioperative and postoperative data were analyzed. RESULTS Thirty-four patients (aged 55.2 ±14.2; 17.6% women) with a mean body mass index of 26.2 ± 3.9 were analyzed. Mean operative time was 99.5 ± 30.5 minutes, 41.2% were left-side repairs, and 50% were bilateral. Estimated blood loss was 18.4 ± 14.1 mL. Recurrent hernias accounted for 14.7% of cases; 32.4% of cases were combination surgeries, most commonly a concurrent umbilical hernia repair. The most common short-term postoperative complication was urinary retention (4 patients). The median length of follow-up was 25 days (IQR 18.75-61.75). Complications occurring at >30 days included hydrocele (2 patients) and stitch abscess (1 patient). Eight (23.5%) patients had complications (surgical or during follow-up). No recurrences or deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS With comparable operative times, perioperative outcomes, and safety profile, SS-TEP appears to be a safe and effective surgical approach for the management of inguinal hernias in the short term. Furthermore, SS-TEP with a self-fixating mesh is a feasible approach.",2017,"Guerron, Alfredo D; Lee, Hui-Jie; Yoo, Jin; Seymour, Keri; Sudan, Ranjan; Portenier, Dana; Park, Chan",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2016.00103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28701857/,3742235.0

METHODS: We searched for articles in PubMed and Google Scholar databases till 02 April 2020, with the following keywords: “SARS-CoV-2”, “COVID-19”, “infection”, “pathogenesis”, “incubation period”, “transmission”, “clinical features”, “diagnosis”, “treatment”, “diabetes”, with interposition of the Boolean operator “AND”. RESULTS: The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure and death. Older age, diabetes and other comorbidities are reported as significant predictors of morbidity and mortality. Chronic inflammation, increased coagulation activity, immune response impairment, and potential direct pancreatic damage by SARS-CoV-2 might be among the underlying mechanisms of the association between diabetes and COVID-19. No conclusive evidence exists to support the discontinuation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers because of COVID-19 in people with diabetes. Caution should be taken to potential hypoglycemic events with the use of chloroquine in these subjects. Patient tailored therapeutic strategies, rigorous glucose monitoring and careful consideration of drug interactions might reduce adverse outcomes.

Importantly, ICAC can be subtyped into a medial or intimal pattern that may differentially influence the effect of EVT in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Methods- All 500 patients included in the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical trial of Endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke in the Netherlands) were evaluated. Volume (mm3) and location pattern (tunica intima or tunica media) of ICAC could be determined on baseline noncontrast computed tomography in 344 patients. Functional outcome at 90 days was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale. Next, we investigated the association of ICAC volume and pattern with functional outcome using adjusted ordinal logistic regression models. Effect modification by EVT was assessed with an interaction term between treatment allocation and ICAC aspect. Results- We found evidence for treatment effect modification by ICAC pattern ( P interaction=0.04). Patients with predominantly medial calcification had better functional outcome with EVT than without this treatment (adjusted common odds ratio, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.23-4.39), but we observed no effect of EVT in patients with predominantly intimal calcifications (adjusted common odds ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.40-1.68). We did not find an association of ICAC volume with functional outcome (adjusted common odds ratio per unit increase ICAC volume 1.01 (95% CI, 0.89-1.13). Moreover, we found no evidence for effect modification by ICAC volume ( P interaction=0.61). Conclusions- The benefit of EVT in acute ischemic stroke patients with a medial calcification pattern is larger than the benefit in patients with an intimal calcification pattern.

CFS is also an essential criterion for determining ceilings of care in people with COVID-19. Our aims were to assess the prevalence of frailty in older patients hospitalised with COVID-19, their sex and age distribution, and the completion rate of the CFS tool in evaluating frailty. Methods: Data were collected from thirteen sites. CFS was assessed routinely at the time of admission to hospital and ranged from 1 (very fit) to 9 (terminally ill). The completion rate of the CFS was assessed. The presence of major comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease was noted. Results: A total of 1277 older patients with COVID-19, aged ≥ 65 (79.9 ± 8.1) years were included in the study, with 98.5% having fully completed CFS.

Among the domestic animals, domestic pig (Sus scrofa f. domestica) suffers most frequently from the disease in human environment. This is a typical animal-borne disease observed mainly in occupational groups employed in agriculture, farming (of animals and birds), fishing and manufacturing industry. METHODS: We are presenting the clinical course of infection (E. rhusiopathiae) and discuss clinical forms. E. rhusiopathiae in humans may have the following clinical course: mild form of skin infection diagnosed as local erythema (erysipeloid), disseminated form of skin infection and the most serious form of infection of systemic course (endocarditis and sepsis). Mild skin infection and local erythema are the most common forms. Very rare case of animal-borne infection course has been presented in which after initial phase the disease was generalised to the abscesses formation in paravertebral space, spondylitis and empyema formation in spinal canal. In the presented clinical case, the patient was suffering from diabetes. It was probably an additional risk factor of the disease generalisation. Patient underwent drainage of empyema in spinal canal, after which his neurological status gradually improved. Antibiotic therapy was implemented and continued for 8 weeks.

METHODS After composition of the research group, a Delphi consensus was initiated to identify and rate all features, which may be relevant to assess UIAs and their treatment by using ranking scales and analysis of inter-rater agreement (IRA) for each factor. IRA was categorized as very high, high, moderate, or low. RESULTS Ultimately, 39 specialists from 4 specialties agreed (high or very high IRAs) on the following key factors for or against UIA treatment decisions: (1) patient age, life expectancy, and comorbid diseases; (2) previous subarachnoid hemorrhage from a different aneurysm, family history for UIA or subarachnoid hemorrhage, nicotine use; (3) UIA size, location, and lobulation; (4) UIA growth or de novo formation on serial imaging; (5) clinical symptoms (cranial nerve deficit, mass effect, and thromboembolic events from UIAs); and (6) risk factors for UIA treatment (patient age and life expectancy, UIA size, and estimated risk of treatment). However, IRAs for features rated with low relevance were also generally low, which underlined the existing controversy about the natural history of UIAs. CONCLUSIONS Our results highlight that neurovascular specialists currently consider many features as important when evaluating UIAs but also highlight that the appreciation of natural history of UIAs remains uncertain, even within a group of highly informed individuals.",2014,"Etminan, Nima; Beseoglu, Kerim; Barrow, Daniel L; Bederson, Joshua; Brown, Robert D; Connolly, E Sander; Derdeyn, Colin P; Hänggi, Daniel; Hasan, David; Juvela, Seppo; Kasuya, Hidetoshi; Kirkpatrick, Peter J; Knuckey, Neville; Koivisto, Timo; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Lawton, Michael T; LeRoux, Peter; McDougall, Cameron G; Mee, Edward; Mocco, J; Molyneux, Andrew; Morgan, Michael K; Mori, Kentaro; Morita, Akio; Murayama, Yuichi; Nagahiro, Shinji; Pasqualin, Alberto; Raabe, Andreas; Raymond, Jean; Rinkel, Gabriel J E; Rüfenacht, Daniel; Seifert, Volker; Spears, Julian; Steiger, Hans-Jakob; Steinmetz, Helmuth; Torner, James C; Vajkoczy, Peter; Wanke, Isabel; Wong, George K C; Wong, John H; Macdonald, R Loch",Stroke,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.114.004519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24668202/,11331257.0

The comparison with direct simulations reveals a higher correlation compared to the shortest-path approach used previously.

PRF efficiency can vary enormously between different stimulatory structures, but the features that lead to efficient PRF stimulation remain uncertain. To address this question, we studied the structural dynamics of the frameshift signal from West Nile virus (WNV), which stimulates -1 PRF at very high levels and has been proposed to form several different structures, including mutually incompatible pseudoknots and a double hairpin. Using optical tweezers to apply tension to single mRNA molecules, mimicking the tension applied by the ribosome during PRF, we found that the WNV frameshift signal formed an unusually large number of different metastable structures, including all of those previously proposed. From force-extension curve measurements, we mapped 2 mutually exclusive pathways for the folding, each encompassing multiple intermediates. We identified the intermediates in each pathway from length changes and the effects of antisense oligomers blocking formation of specific contacts. Intriguingly, the number of transitions between the different conformers of the WNV frameshift signal was maximal in the range of forces applied by the ribosome during -1 PRF. Furthermore, the occupancy of the pseudoknotted conformations was far too low for static pseudoknots to account for the high levels of -1 PRF. These results support the hypothesis that conformational heterogeneity plays a key role in frameshifting and suggest that transitions between different conformers under tension are linked to efficient PRF stimulation.",2019,"Halma, Matthew T J; Ritchie, Dustin B; Cappellano, Tonia R; Neupane, Krishna; Woodside, Michael T",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1905258116; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31409714/,199574815.0

A narrative review,10.14814/phy2.14615,PMC7749581,33340275.0,cc-by,"Recent reports suggest that high‐altitude residence may be beneficial in the novel coronavirus disease (COVID‐19) implicating that traveling to high places or using hypoxic conditioning thus could be favorable as well. Physiological high‐altitude characteristics and symptoms of altitude illnesses furthermore seem similar to several pathologies associated with COVID‐19. As a consequence, high altitude and hypoxia research and related clinical practices are discussed for potential applications in COVID‐19 prevention and treatment. We summarize the currently available evidence on the relationship between altitude/hypoxia conditions and COVID‐19 epidemiology and pathophysiology. The potential for treatment strategies used for altitude illnesses is evaluated. Symptomatic overlaps in the pathophysiology of COVID‐19 induced ARDS and high altitude illnesses (i.e., hypoxemia, dyspnea…) have been reported but are also common to other pathologies (i.e., heart failure, pulmonary embolism, COPD…). Most treatments of altitude illnesses have limited value and may even be detrimental in COVID‐19. Some may be efficient, potentially the corticosteroid dexamethasone. Physiological adaptations to altitude/hypoxia can exert diverse effects, depending on the constitution of the target individual and the hypoxic dose. In healthy individuals, they may optimize oxygen supply and increase mitochondrial, antioxidant, and immune system function. It is highly debated if these physiological responses to hypoxia overlap in many instances with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and may exert preventive effects under very specific conditions. The temporal overlap of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and exposure to altitude/hypoxia may be detrimental. No evidence‐based knowledge is presently available on whether and how altitude/hypoxia may prevent, treat or aggravate COVID‐19. The reported lower incidence and mortality of COVID‐19 in high‐altitude places remain to be confirmed. High‐altitude illnesses and COVID‐19 pathologies exhibit clear pathophysiological differences. While potentially effective as a prophylactic measure, altitude/hypoxia is likely associated with elevated risks for patients with COVID‐19. Altogether, the different points discussed in this review are of possibly some relevance for individuals who aim to reach high‐altitude areas. However, due to the ever‐changing state of understanding of COVID‐19, all points discussed in this review may be out of date at the time of its publication.",2020-12-19,"Millet, Grégoire P.; Debevec, Tadej; Brocherie, Franck; Burtscher, Martin; Burtscher, Johannes",Physiol Rep,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ca37dfdc853ee8f93ed8a2fb033d966609f1e592.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7749581.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33340275/; https://doi.org/10.14814/phy2.14615,229324903.0

However, the impact of extracellular ATP on chemoresistance and the mechanisms behind ATP pro-invasion and pro-chemoresistance remain unclear. Here we aimed to determine the molecules or signaling pathways involved. cDNA microarray was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes before and after ATP treatment. As a result, Sex-determining region Y-box 9 (SOX9) was up-regulated after ATP treatment in breast cancer cells. In vitro invasion and migration assays demonstrated that knocking down SOX9 attenuated ATP-driven invasive capability. Mass spectrometry and co-IP revealed that SOX9 interacted with Janus kinase 1 (JAK1). Afterward, IL-6-JAK1-STAT3 signaling was demonstrated to promote SOX9 expression and invasion following ATP treatment. Notably, ATP-IL-6-SOX9 signaling was shown to stimulate chemoresistance in breast cancer cells. ChIP assays identified some potential SOX9 target genes, among which carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5/6 (CEACAM5/6) was demonstrated to mediate ATP pro-invasive function, while ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) mediated ATP-driven chemoresistance. In addition, SOX9-knockdown and apyrase (an ATP hydrolase)-treated MDA-MB-231 cells illustrated decreased tumor growth and enhanced drug sensitivity in nude mice. In vitro spheroid formation assays also proved the significance of ATP-SOX9 in mediating chemoresistance.

The aims of this study were (1) to summarise the reported risk of VTE associated with COVID-19 infections and (2) to summarise guidance documents on thromboprophylaxis in COVID-19 patients, in a systematic review. METHODS We systematically searched for peer-reviewed evidence on the risk of VTE in patients with COVID-19, in PubMed, Embase and Twitter, and for guidelines or guidance documents for thromboprophylaxis, from international or national societies relevant to the field of thrombosis and haemostasis, up to April 30 2020. RESULTS We found 11 studies (1 clinical trial, 7 retrospective cohorts and 3 prospective cohorts), which included a range of 16 to 388 in patients with COVID-19 (total of 1369 inpatients). The diagnoses of COVID-19 and VTE were of high quality, but the follow-up was often unclear. Most studies reported universal in-hospital thromboprophylaxis. Among all inpatients and among intensive care unit (ICU) inpatients with COVID-19, reported risks of VTE were 4.4–8.2% (three studies) and 0–35.3% (six studies), respectively. Two studies at least partially screened for VTE in ICU inpatients with COVID-19, and found risks of 24.7–53.8%. We found 12 guidelines for thromboprophylaxis of COVID-19 patients. The majority suggested universal pharmacological thromboprophylaxis in all COVID-19 inpatients, but there was heterogeneity in the suggested intensity of thromboprophylaxis: seven advised considering intensified doses of heparin according to the clinical or biological severity of the disease, especially in the ICU setting. CONCLUSIONS Venous thromboembolism very commonly complicates the clinical course of inpatients with COVID-19, despite thromboprophylaxis. The risk appears highest among critically ill inpatients. We found no estimates of risks among outpatients. Many questions remain unresolved, as delineated by the heterogeneity of national and international guidelines.

The airline transportation network in particular shrinks the geographical space by reducing travel time between the world's most populated areas and defines the main channels along which emergent diseases will spread. In this paper, we investigate the role of the large-scale properties of the airline transportation network in determining the global propagation pattern of emerging diseases. We put forward a stochastic computational framework for the modeling of the global spreading of infectious diseases that takes advantage of the complete International Air Transport Association 2002 database complemented with census population data. The model is analyzed by using for the first time an information theory approach that allows the quantitative characterization of the heterogeneity level and the predictability of the spreading pattern in presence of stochastic fluctuations. In particular we are able to assess the reliability of numerical forecast with respect to the intrinsic stochastic nature of the disease transmission and travel flows. The epidemic pattern predictability is quantitatively determined and traced back to the occurrence of epidemic pathways defining a backbone of dominant connections for the disease spreading.

However, empirical evidence around its effectiveness lacks clarity. This review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of goal-setting interventions on diabetes outcomes and to determine which behaviour change techniques (BCTs) are frequently used within these interventions. METHODS A systematic search identified 14 studies, describing 12 interventions targeting diabetic-control which incorporated goal-setting as the main intervention strategy. Study characteristics, outcome measures and effect sizes of the included studies were extracted and checked by two authors. The BCT taxonomy v1 was used to identify intervention content. Meta-analyses were conducted to assess intervention effects on the primary outcome of average blood glucose levels (HbA1c) and on body-weight. Psycho-social and behavioural outcomes were summarised in narrative syntheses. RESULTS Significant post-intervention improvements in HbA1C were found (-.22, 95% CI, -.40, -.04) across studies. No other main effects were identified. The BCT 'goal-setting (behaviour)' was most frequently implemented and was identified in 84% of the interventions. CONCLUSIONS Goal-setting interventions appear to be associated with reduced HbA1C levels. However, the low numbers of studies identified and the risk biases across studies suggest more research is needed to further explore goal-setting BCTs in diabetes self-management.",2018,"Fredrix, Milou; McSharry, Jenny; Flannery, Caragh; Dinneen, Sean; Byrne, Molly",Psychology & health,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2018.1432760; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29498547/,3615154.0

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, several antimicrobial drugs have lost their efficacy and are no longer useful to treat life-threatening infections. Since the exacerbation of antimicrobial resistance is likely to be another casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a pressing need to develop innovative strategies to minimize the risk of antimicrobial resistance. Areas covered: Focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic, I have briefly summarized the current knowledge and challenges in our understanding of antimicrobial resistance, emphasizing quorum sensing and quorum quenching. Our understanding of bacterial communication by quorum sensing to acquire virulence has paved the way to reduce bacterial pathogenicity through quorum quenching. Availability of clinically viable quorum quenching agents would likely to diminish bacterial virulence to create a microenvironment for the host phagocytic cells to reduce bacterial infection. Expert opinion: Future studies that aim to generate clinically useful quorum quenching agents need to be considered. An important benefit of such agents may be a diminished risk of antimicrobial resistance.",2020,"Razzaque, Mohammed S",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,,#978557,,,,,229283311.0

Cardiovascular diseases and diabetes are important risk factors for a lethal outcome of COVID-19.

COVID-19 is caused by a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The aim of the study is to contribute to the surveillance of the pandemic by bringing new knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity among healthcare workers. It seeks to evaluate whether certain job functions are associated with a higher risk of being infected and to clarify if such association is mediated by the number of individuals that employees meet during a workday. In addition, we investigate regional and national differences in seroprevalence. METHODS This research involved a bi-national prospective observational cohort study including 3272 adults employed at Falck in Sweden and Denmark. Participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies every second week for a period of 8 weeks from 22 June 2020 until 10 August 2020. Descriptive statistics as well as multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied. RESULTS Of the 3272 Falck employees participating in this study, 159 (4.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The seroprevalence was lower among Danish Falck employees than among those from Sweden (2.8% in Denmark and 8.3% in Sweden). We also found that the number of customer or patient contacts during a workday was the most prominent predictor for seropositivity and that ambulance staff was the most vulnerable staff group.

204152,7bu0gxp6,,WHO,Maxim Integrated Smartphone Sensor With App Meets FDA/ISO Standards for Clinical Pulse Oximetry and Can Be Reliably Used by a Wide Range of Patients,,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Millions of smartphones contain a photoplethysmography (PPG) biosensor (Maxim Integrated) that accurately measures pulse oximetry. No clinical use of these embedded sensors is currently being made, despite the relevance of remote clinical pulse oximetry to the management of chronic cardiopulmonary disease, and the triage, initial management, and remote monitoring of people affected by respiratory viral pandemics, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or influenza. To be used for clinical pulse oximetry the embedded PPG system must be paired with an application (app) and meet US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) requirements. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does this smartphone sensor with app meet FDA/ISO requirements? Are measurements obtained using this system comparable to those of hospital reference devices, across a wide range of people? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed laboratory testing addressing ISO and FDA requirements in 10 participants using the smartphone sensor with app. Subsequently, we performed an open-label clinical study on 320 participants with widely varying characteristics, to compare the accuracy and precision of readings obtained by patients with those of hospital reference devices, using rigorous statistical methodology. RESULTS: ""Breathe down"" testing in the laboratory showed that the total root-mean-square deviation of oxygen saturation (Spo2) measurement was 2.02%, meeting FDA/ISO standards. Clinical comparison of the smartphone sensor with app vs hospital reference devices determined that Spo2 and heart rate accuracy were 0.48% points (95% CI, 0.38-0.58; P < .001) and 0.73 bpm (95% CI, 0.33-1.14; P < .001), respectively; Spo2 and heart rate precision were 1.25 vs reference 0.95 points (P < .001) and 5.99 vs reference 3.80 bpm (P < .001), respectively. These small differences were similar to the variation found between two FDA-approved reference instruments for Spo2: accuracy, 0.52 points (95% CI, 0.41-0.64; P < .001) and precision, 1.01 vs 0.86 (P < .001). INTERPRETATION: Our findings support the application for full FDA/ISO approval of the smartphone sensor with app tested for use in clinical pulse oximetry. Given the immense and immediate practical medical importance of remote intermittent clinical pulse oximetry to both chronic disease management and the global ability to respond to respiratory viral pandemics, the smartphone sensor with app should be prioritized and fast-tracked for FDA/ISO approval to allow clinical use.

Cuts to essential services, coupled with a growing homeless population, create a challenging environment to tackle this public health crisis. In this paper, we highlight an underexplored environmental constraint faced by people living and injecting drugs on the streets. Access to water for injection is restricted in the UK, due to legislative and financial barriers. Austerity measures, such as public toilet closures, further restrict the ability of people made homeless to access clean water and protect themselves from health harms. METHODS: We generated questionnaire (n = 455) and in-depth qualitative interview (n = 32) data with people who inject drugs in London for the Care and Prevent study. Participants provided detail on their life history; drug use, injecting and living environments; health conditions and care seeking practices. FINDINGS: A high proportion of the survey sample reported lifetime history of street homelessness (78%), bacterial infections (65%) and related hospitalisation (30%). Qualitative accounts highlight unsafe, potentially dangerous, injection practices in semi-public spaces. Multiple constraints to sourcing sterile water for injection preparation were reported. Alternatives to sterile water included puddle water, toilet cistern water, whisky, cola soda and saliva. Participants who injected heroin and crack cocaine together unanimously reported adding water at two stages during injection preparation: first, adding water as a vehicle for heroin (which was then heated); second, adding cold water to the heroin mixture prior to adding the crack cocaine. This new finding of a stage addition of solvent may represent an additional risk of infection. CONCLUSION: Currently, harm reduction equipment and resources for safe injecting are not meeting the needs of people who inject drugs who are street homeless or unstably housed. Preparation of injections with non-sterile water sources could precipitate bacterial and fungal infections, particularly when used without the application of heat. It is crucial that water for injection, also skin cleaning, is made available for the unstably housed and that harm reduction messaging is tailored to speak to the everyday realities of people who prepare and inject drugs in public spaces.",2020-04-10,"Harris, Magdalena; Scott, Jenny; Hope, Vivian; Wright, Talen; McGowan, Catherine; Ciccarone, Daniel",Harm Reduct J,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/62503f1644ab37642dbc887d28642c76c288bf09.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7145770.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32276626/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-020-00369-0,215565689.0

It is very important to determine the efficacy of these tests in the diagnosis of the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus due to the global spread of this new influenza virus. METHODS: We evaluated 4 rapid influenza diagnostic tests (Binax Now Influenza A&B, BD Directigen EZ Flu A+B, Fujirebio Espline Influenza A&B-N, and BioTracer Influenza A&B Test) for their ability to detect the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus and compared these results with the diagnostic sensitivity obtained following real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the same samples. RESULTS: Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of 252 specimens identified 176 influenza A (H1N1) positive samples. Of these, between 29 and 62 also tested positive using the 4 rapid tests examined, demonstrating the sensitivity of the respective tests was 16.5%–35.2% with specificities of 100%. However, the 4 rapid tests were 77.3%–100% sensitive when samples contained high influenza A (H1N1) virus titers, suggesting the sensitivity of these detection kits was dependent on viral loads. Finally, the sensitivity of the 4 detection kits tested was higher when samples from children were examined compared with samples from adults. CONCLUSIONS: Data presented in this report indicated the sensitivity of the respective influenza antigen detection test kits examined was low compared to the sensitivity observed following RT-PCR. Nonetheless, they are useful tools during early outbreak investigations of influenza-like illnesses, particularly in the screening of critically ill patients and pediatric patients.

Consequently, it has become necessary to provide guidance for triaging interventional pain procedures, or related elective surgery restrictions during a pandemic. OBJECTIVES: The aim of these guidelines is to provide education and guidance for physicians, healthcare administrators, the public and patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our goal is to restore the opportunity to receive appropriate care for our patients who may benefit from interventional techniques. METHODS: The American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) has created the COVID-19 Task Force in order to provide guidance for triaging interventional pain procedures or related elective surgery restrictions to provide appropriate access to interventional pain management (IPM) procedures in par with other elective surgical procedures. In developing the guidance, trustworthy standards and appropriate disclosures of conflicts of interest were applied with a section of a panel of experts from various regions, specialties, types of practices (private practice, community hospital and academic institutes) and groups. The literature pertaining to all aspects of COVID-19, specifically related to epidemiology, risk factors, complications, morbidity and mortality, and literature related to risk mitigation and stratification was reviewed. The evidence -- informed with the incorporation of the best available research and practice knowledge was utilized, instead of a simplified evidence-based approach. Consequently, these guidelines are considered evidence-informed with the incorporation of the best available research and practice knowledge. RESULTS: The Task Force defined the medical urgency of a case and developed an IPM acuity scale for elective IPM procedures with 3 tiers. These included urgent, emergency, and elective procedures. Examples of urgent and emergency procedures included new onset or exacerbation of complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), acute trauma or acute exacerbation of degenerative or neurological disease resulting in impaired mobility and inability to perform activities of daily living. Examples include painful rib fractures affecting oxygenation and post-dural puncture headaches limiting the ability to sit upright, stand and walk. In addition, emergency procedures include procedures to treat any severe or debilitating disease that prevents the patient from carrying out activities of daily living. Elective procedures were considered as any condition that is stable and can be safely managed with alternatives. LIMITATIONS: COVID-19 continues to be an ongoing pandemic. When these recommendations were developed, different stages of reopening based on geographical regulations were in process. The pandemic continues to be dynamic creating every changing evidence-based guidance. Consequently, we provided evidence-informed guidance. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges in IPM creating needless suffering for pain patients. Many IPM procedures cannot be indefinitely postponed without adverse consequences. Chronic pain exacerbations are associated with marked functional declines and risks with alternative treatment modalities. They must be treated with the concern that they deserve. Clinicians must assess patients, local healthcare resources, and weigh the risks and benefits of a procedure against the risks of suffering from disabling pain and exposure to the COVID-19 virus.",2020,"Gharibo, Christopher; Sharma, Amit; Soin, Amol; Shah, Shalini; Diwan, Sudhir; Buenaventura, Ricardo; Nampiaparampil, Devi E; Aydin, Steve; Bakshi, Sanjay; Abdi, Salahadin; Jha, Sachin Sunny; Cordner, Harold; Kaye, Alan D; Abd-Elsayed, Alaa; Candido, Kenneth D; Knezevic, Nebojsa Nick; Atluri, Sairam; Wargo, Bradley W; Sanapati, Mahendra R; Datta, Sukdeb; Hirsch, Joshua A; Manchikanti, Laxmaiah; Rajput, Kartic",Pain Physician,,#777067,,,,,221788870.0
212622,ej48zkfl,,WHO,Implementing Group Parent Training in Telepsychology: Lessons Learned During the COVID-19 Pandemic,,,,unk,"OBJECTIVE: We recently transitioned from in-person delivery of a brief behavioral parent intervention to telepsychology delivery to meet families' needs during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this topical review, we describe how we used treatment fidelity as a guiding principle to orient adaptations for telepsychology, as well as preliminary findings and early lessons learned in this implementation. Methods: Using rapid-cycle quality improvement methods, we adapted a brief parent training group (Bootcamp for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder; BC-ADHD) to three groups of caregivers (i.e., 5-7 families) of school-aged children with ADHD (n = 20; 85% males). Families were from the following ethnic backgrounds: 75% White non-Hispanic, 15% White Hispanic, and 10% Black. Clinicians completed measures on their implementation experience. Observers completed measures on content/process fidelity and attendance. Caregivers completed measures on demographics, treatment satisfaction, and telepsychology experience. RESULTS: Telepsychology BC-ADHD can be implemented with comparably high levels of content and process fidelity and treatment satisfaction to in-person groups; and it appears to be feasible and acceptable to caregivers. Caregiver and clinician qualitative feedback revealed themes of appreciating the convenience of telepsychology, while experiencing some challenges in relating to others and sharing over video. CONCLUSIONS: When treatment fidelity is used as a guiding tool, telepsychology parent training groups can be delivered with high fidelity and appear to be acceptable and feasible to caregivers and clinicians. Future research using larger and more diverse samples, multimethod and multi-informant measurement approaches, and controlled designs is needed to further assess the generalizability and efficacy of telepsychology parent training groups.",2020,"Fogler, Jason M; Normand, Sébastien; O039,; Dea, Nicole; Mautone, Jennifer A; Featherston, Marilyn; Power, Thomas J; Nissley-Tsiopinis, Jenelle",J Pediatr Psychol,,#780412,,,,,221770381.0

Community-wide genetic diversity of Metarhizium species among 480 soil isolates from 14 states of western USA was investigated to assess the contributions of clonality and recombination in determining each species' population structure. Seven species, varying >100-fold in relative abundance, were identified by phylogenetic analysis of 5' EF1-α (5TEF), including M. robertsii (n=372), M. guizhouense (n=37), M. brunneum (n=37), M. lepidiotae (n=14), M. pemphigi (n=11), M. anisopliae (n=7) and M. pingshaense (n=2). Analyses of composite multilocus genotypes integrating 5TEF sequences, multilocus microsatellites and mating type idiomorphs conducted on a subset of 239 isolates revealed that all species populations display pronounced clonal structure. Following clone-correction procedures to remove redundant clonal genotypes and collapse clonal lineages, each species' population sample was determined to be composed of a dozen or fewer genetically unique individuals. Thus, the Metarhizium community inhabiting western USA is conservatively estimated to comprise as few as 34 distinct genetic individuals, with a single, geographically ubiquitous clonal lineage of M. robertsii constituting 45% of total isolates. M. robertsii was the only population determined to be in linkage equilibrium. However, the high proportion of private alleles differentiating most M. robertsii clonal lineages argues against contemporary panmixia, thus the recombination signal detected may be historical. Nevertheless, within M. robertsii, M. brunneum and M. guizhouense there are closely related genotypes of opposite mating type, which suggests that if recombination is contemporary, it likely occurs between closely related individuals. The restricted number of genetic individuals observed throughout western North American Metarhizium species may signify these represent peripheral populations descended from limited numbers of founders among whom there has been little recombination relative to the extent of clone expansion and within-clone genetic divergence.",2020-10-15,"Rehner, Stephen A",Journal of invertebrate pathology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2020.107491; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069670/,224782252.0

In soccer, practitioners are concerned about the effects of long-term detraining on players' conditioning, and caution is required when activities return. This study assessed body composition, jump and sprint performance, hamstring eccentric strength, and intermittent cardiorespiratory fitness of 23 male professional soccer players who returned to training activities after 63 days of quarantine. The results were compared with their physical condition assessed before a pre-season phase as soon as they returned to training after a regular 24-day off-season period. In comparison with after off-season assessments, the quarantine induced significant increases in body mass, body fat mass, 10- and 20-m sprint times as well as decreases in countermovement jump height (p < 0.05). There were no significant changes in hamstring eccentric strength, squat jump height, and cardiorespiratory fitness (p > 0.05). In summary, we showed that 63 days of quarantine impaired several physical performance measures compared with regular off-season in soccer players.

Disruption is rarely defined and almost never measured Equally, the influence of the hype around disruption is hard to gauge The authors do not know to what extent hype is driving management action This is worrisome as the disruption “noise level” can lead to unhealthy collective thinking and bad business decision-making Some rigour is required To craft winning strategies, executives should take a more evidence-based approach for managing disruption FindingsThe authors’ failed to find evidence of any correlation between the hype around an industry disruption and actual disruption within that industry So the important conclusion for executives is “do not believe the hype” We found some surprising differences by industry between actual disruption and the hype by industry Research limitations/implicationsDisruption is one of the most talked about subject in the field of strategy, yet there is little quantification With this research, the authors’ aim is to advance the fact-based understanding of disruption Disruption hype is never measured but has a strong influence on executives The authors have quantified hype using online, search, social media and survey sources Much more is needed to be able to measure hype more accurately Practical implicationsThe authors’ recommend a set of practical guidelines for executives to support fact-based strategy formulation: analysis of actual disruption, scenario planning and strategic responses Social implicationsThe “noise” around industry disruption is so high that it is assumed to happen Much of what is written is quasi-fake news The authors need to rebalance the debate with fact-based analysis Originality/valueTo authors’ knowledge, there has never been any fact-based analysis of both actual and hype disruption levels",2020,"Wade, Michael; Bonnet, Didier C.

Several studies report that ABO blood group polymorphism may be related to COVID-19 susceptibility and clinical outcomes; however, the results are controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate whether ABO blood groups are associated with increased COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. A total of 715 articles were retrieved from seven databases. Ten articles were selected for meta-analysis after removal of duplicates and two levels of screenings. Overall, individuals with blood group A [odds ratio (OR) = 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 1.56] and B (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.13) had a substantially higher risk of COVID-19, whereas this was not the case for blood group AB (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.30). Individuals with blood group O was not prone to develop the disease (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.84). Moreover, the risk of COVID-19 was significantly associated with the Rh-positive blood group (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.50). A meta-analysis of 5 studies suggested that blood group A was associated with a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.52). Mild publication bias was found in the included studies. This systematic review and meta-analysis indicated that blood groups A and B may be risk factors for COVID-19, whereas the blood group O appears to be protective. Blood group A may be related to unfavourable outcomes.

While interventionist approaches and incentives have been adopted in many countries to curb these problems, a punitive measure is used in Hong Kong instead. The Housing Department launched the Marking Scheme for Tenancy Enforcement in Public Housing Estates immediately after the SARS epidemic. The scheme operates as a penalty-point system where sitting tenants will be expelled from public housing if they receive sixteen points for the misdeeds they have committed. Yet, the marking scheme itself was put onto the stage without any prior public consultation. Besides, it has been criticised for its unfair and tenure-biased enforcement. Also, whether the scheme is widely accepted is highly doubtful. Against this background, this study aims to explore the tenants’ views regarding residents’ unacceptable behaviour and the marking scheme in Hong Kong’s public housing.

But it's likely that, once disruption and uncertainty fade, the rebound in activity will be strong. It's important for firms to position themselves for such a recovery. ▪ Historical evidence supports this view. In the past 200 years, short recessions have typically been followed by robust recovery. Long‐term impacts from natural disasters have generally only been evident for specific hazards. Except for AIDS, longer‐term pandemic effects also appear to have been contained. ▪ Surveys during the 2003 SARS and 2009 influenza outbreaks highlight one explanation for time‐limited impacts. Public fears increased alongside rising infection rates, but they dissipated promptly as outbreaks came under control. ▪ Our modelling is consistent with these stylised facts. In our coronavirus pandemic scenario, global growth grinds to a halt in Q2 2020 but then rebounds to a rapid pace within a year. With much of the initial output loss recovered in a relatively short period of time, long‐term impacts are limited. ▪ But there are risks to this view. The period of disruption could be longer than anticipated, depending on the potential spread and seasonality of COVID‐19 and policy actions to mitigate the fallout. Opinion polls also highlight the potential risk of larger, more persistent effects for some countries. ▪ Moreover, coronavirus‐related weakness and associated financial distress could expose other key vulnerabilities ‐ for example related to deteriorating corporate sector balance sheets and fragile trade relations.

Cytoplasmic fluorescent discrete protein structures were observed in infected cells, corresponding to the vesicles containing the viral RNA replication complex. The vesicles were motile and aligned with microfilaments. Intracellular movement of the vesicles was inhibited when cells were infiltrated with latrunculin B, an inhibitor of microfilament polymerization. It was also observed that viral accumulation in the presence of this drug was reduced. These data indicate that microfilaments are used for vesicle movement and are necessary for virus production. Biogenesis of the vesicles was further investigated by infecting cells with two recombinant TuMV strains: one expressed 6K2GFP and the other expressed 6K2mCherry. Green- and red-only vesicles were observed within the same cell, suggesting that each vesicle originated from a single viral genome. There were also vesicles that exhibited sectors of green, red, or yellow fluorescence, an indication that fusion among individual vesicles is possible. Protoplasts derived from TuMV-infected N. benthamiana leaves were isolated. Using immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy, viral RNA synthesis sites were visualized as punctate structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm.

METHODS: We distributed an electronic questionnaire using the popular social application WeChat to adults from any province of China except Hubei Province, the epicenter of the outbreak. The questionnaire asked for demographic information, body weight, physical activity, and lifestyle factors before and during the quarantine. RESULTS: Of 376 questionnaires returned, 339 were valid (90.2%). During the period of semi-lockdown, both females and males with BMI <24 gained weight, males with BMI ≥24 lost weight, and females with BMI ≥24 gained weight. The average steps per day and the average moderate or vigorous-intensity exercise declined significantly for both males and females during the semi-lockdown. Changes in body weight inversely correlated with changes in steps per day and moderate or vigorous-intensity exercise during the quarantine.

As part of broader big data and digital humanitarianism discourses, there is an emerging interest in data produced through mobile phone communications for enhancing the data environment in such circumstances. This paper assembles user perspectives and critically examines existing evidence and future potential of mobile phone data derived from call detail records (CDRs) and two-way short message service (SMS) platforms, for managing and responding to humanitarian disasters caused by communicable disease outbreaks. We undertake a scoping review of relevant literature and in-depth interviews with key informants to ascertain the: (i) information that can be gathered from CDRs or SMS data; (ii) phase(s) in the disease disaster management cycle when mobile data may be useful; (iii) value added over conventional approaches to data collection and transfer; (iv) barriers and enablers to use of mobile data in disaster contexts; and (v) the social and ethical challenges. Based on this evidence we develop a typology of mobile phone data sources, types, and end-uses, and a decision-tree for mobile data use, designed to enable effective use of mobile data for disease disaster management. We show that mobile data holds great potential for improving the quality, quantity and timing of selected information required for disaster management, but that testing and evaluation of the benefits, constraints and limitations of mobile data use in a wider range of mobile-user and disaster contexts is needed to fully understand its utility, validity, and limitations.",2016-08-24,"Cinnamon, Jonathan; Jones, Sarah K.; Adger, W.

There are important roles for higher quality district hospital care within these systems. These hospitals are also sources of information of considerable importance to health systems, but this role, as with the wider roles of district hospitals, has been neglected. KEY MESSAGES: As we make efforts to develop higher quality health systems in LMIC we highlight the critical importance of district hospitals focusing here on how data on hospital mortality offers value: i) in understanding disease burden; ii) as part of surveillance and impact monitoring; iii) as an entry point to exploring system failures; and iv) as a lens to examine variability in health system performance and possibly as a measure of health system quality in its own right. However, attention needs paying to improving data quality by addressing reporting gaps and cause of death reporting. Ideally enabling the collection of basic, standardised patient level data might support at least simple case-mix and case-severity adjustment helping us understand variation. Better mortality data could support impact evaluation, benchmarking, exploration of links between health system inputs and outcomes and critical scrutiny of geographic variation in quality and outcomes of care. Improved hospital information is a neglected but broadly valuable public good. CONCLUSION: Accurate, complete and timely hospital mortality reporting is a key attribute of a functioning health system. It can support countries’ efforts to transition to higher quality health systems in LMIC enabling national and local advocacy, accountability and action.",2018-03-01,"English, Mike; Mwaniki, Paul; Julius, Thomas; Chepkirui, Mercy; Gathara, David; Ouma, Paul O.; Cherutich, Peter; Okiro, Emelda A.; Snow, Robert W.",BMC Med,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/61472699f26e3bedce001d84f6e4791ac50652f0.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5833062.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29495961/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-018-1024-8,3615508.0

This study aimed to evaluate the anti-bacterial effects of a previously designed peptide named PVP towards the clinical strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in vitro. Secondary structure, cytotoxicity, and membrane-permeabilizing effects of the peptide were also assessed. PVP had a tendency to adopt alpha-helical conformation based upon structural predictions and circular dichroism spectroscopy (in 50% trifluoroethanol). The peptide showed MIC values ranging from 1 to 16 µg/mL against 10 strains of MRSA. In contrast to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin, PVP at sub-lethal concentration (1 µg/mL) did not provoke the development of peptide resistance after 14 serial passages. Remarkably, 1 h of exposure to 4 × MBC of PVP (8 µg/mL) was sufficient for total bacterial clearance, whereas 4 × MBC of vancomycin (8 µg/mL) failed to totally eradicate bacterial cells, even after 8 h. PVP showed negligible cytotoxicity against human dermal fibroblasts at concentrations required to kill the MRSA strains. The results of flow cytometric analysis and fluorescence microscopy revealed that PVP caused bacterial membrane permeabilization, eventually culminating in cell death. Owing to the potent anti-bacterial activity, fast bactericidal kinetics, and negligible cytotoxicity, PVP has the potential to be used as a candidate antibiotic for the topical treatment of MRSA infections.",2020-10-21,"Memariani, Hamed; Memariani, Mojtaba; Robati, Reza Mahmoud; Nasiri, Soheila; Abdollahimajd, Fahimeh; Baseri, Zohre; Moravvej, Hamideh",World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11274-020-02948-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083940/,224823633.0

It is composed of 3 different subdimensions: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and reduced personal accomplishment (PA). In the last years, interest in BS in the neurosurgical community has increased. Here we investigated burnout among neurosurgeons and residents in neurosurgery. METHODS: A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed following PRISMA guidelines. A search of bibliographic databases was conducted from study inception to February 2020. A total of 16,377 studies were found. Six articles were included in our final analysis. Their references were checked for additional studies, but none were found. RESULTS: From the initial 16,377 studies identified, only 6 met our inclusion criteria. These studies included a total of 3310 physicians. The general prevalence of BS was 48%. The prevalence in neurosurgeons was 51.1%, higher than that recorded in neurosurgical residents (45.4%). Regarding subdimensions, personal accomplishment seemed to be the most influential factor for burnout development among neurosurgeons (42.57%) and residents (51.56%) alike. CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgery is a rewarding career choice, but numerous challenges and stressors can lead to lower levels of satisfaction and dangerously increased levels of burnout. We hope that our results will generate discussion, raise awareness, stimulate further studies, and lead to programs designed to mitigate excessive stress and burnout in neurosurgeons.",2020,"Zaed, Ismail; Jaaiddane, Youssef; Chibbaro, Salvatore; Tinterri, Benedetta",World neurosurgery (Online),,#702556,,,,,221091355.0

Here, we report the clinical characteristics and outcomes for both patients with COVID-19 and the anaesthetists who provided their spinal anaesthesia. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with radiologically confirmed COVID-19 for Caesarean section or lower-limb surgery undergoing spinal anaesthesia in Zhongnan Hospital, Wuhan, China participated in this retrospective study. Clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes were recorded. For anaesthesiologists exposed to patients with COVID-19 by providing spinal anaesthesia, the level of personal protective equipment (PPE) used, clinical outcomes (pulmonary CT scans), and confirmed COVID-19 transmission rates (polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) were reviewed. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients with COVID-19 requiring supplementary oxygen before surgery had spinal anaesthesia (ropivacaine 0.75%), chiefly for Caesarean section (45/49 [91%]). Spinal anaesthesia was not associated with cardiorespiratory compromise intraoperatively. No patients subsequently developed severe pneumonia. Of 44 anaesthetists, 37 (84.1%) provided spinal anaesthesia using Level 3 PPE. Coronavirus disease 2019 infection was subsequently confirmed by PCR in 5/44 (11.4%) anaesthetists.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) converts angiotensin II to angiotensin (1-7) and thus, may protect against effects of angiotensin II. We hypothesized that ACE2 deficiency increases oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in cerebral arteries and examined the role of ACE2 in age-related cerebrovascular dysfunction. METHODS Endothelial function, expression of angiotensin system components, NADPH oxidase subunits, and proinflammatory cytokines were examined in cerebral arteries from adult (12 months old) and old (24 months old) ACE2 knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice. The superoxide scavenger tempol was used to examine the role of oxidative stress on endothelial function. RESULTS Vasodilatation to acetylcholine was impaired in adult ACE2 KO (24±6% [mean±SE]) compared with WT mice (52±7%; P<0.05). In old mice, vasodilatation to acetylcholine was impaired in WT mice (29±6%) and severely impaired in ACE2 KO mice (7±5%). Tempol improved endothelial function in adult and old ACE2 KO and WT mice. Aging increased mRNA for tumor necrosis factor-α in WT mice, and significantly increased mRNA levels of NAPDH oxidase 2, p47(phox), and Regulator of calcineurin 1 in both ACE2 KO and WT mice. mRNA levels of angiotensin system components did not change during aging.

Methods: From February 5 to March 8, 2020, 73 patients (male to female, ratio of 43:30; mean age, 51 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were retrospectively enrolled and followed up until discharge from three institutions in China. The patients were divided into the severe and non-severe groups according to treatment option. The patterns and distribution of lung abnormalities, total CT scores, single ground-glass opacity (GGO) CT scores, single consolidation CT scores, single reticular CT scores and the amounts of zones involved were reviewed by 2 radiologists. These features were analyzed for temporal changes. Results: In non-severe group, total CT scores (median, 9.5) and the amounts of zones involved were slowly increased and peaked in disease week 2. In the severe group, the increase was faster, with scores also peaking at 2 weeks (median, 20). In both groups, the later parameters began to decrease in week 4 (median values of 9 and 19 in the non-severe and severe groups, respectively). In the severe group, the dominant residual lung lesions were reticular (median single reticular CT score, 10) and consolidation (median single consolidation CT score, 7). In the non-severe group, the dominant residual lung lesions were GGO (median single GGO CT score, 7) and reticular (median single reticular CT score, 4). In both non-severe and severe groups, the GGO pattern was dominant in week 1, with a higher proportion in the severe group compared with the non-severe group (72% vs. 65%). The consolidation pattern peaked in week 2, with 9 (32%) and 19 (73%) in the non-severe and severe groups, respectively; the reticular pattern became dominant from week 4 (both group >40%).

This makes amyloid fibrils a challenging focus for inhibition studies because the peptides and proteins that form amyloid fibrils cannot be targeted based on a sequence motif. Most peptide inhibitors that target specific amyloidogenic proteins rely heavily on sequence recognition to ensure that the inhibitory peptide is able to bind its target. This approach is limited to targeting one amyloidogenic protein at a time. However, there is increasing evidence of cross-reactivity between amyloid-forming polypeptides. It has therefore become more useful to study the similarities between these proteins that goes beyond their sequence homology. Indeed, the observation that amyloidogenic proteins adopt similar secondary structures along the pathway to fibril formation opens the way to an interesting investigation: the development of inhibitors that could be universal amyloid traps. The review below will analyze two specific amyloidogenic proteins, α-synuclein and human amylin, and introduce a small number of peptides that have been shown to be capable of inhibiting the amyloidogenesis of both of these very dissimilar polypeptides. Some of the inhibitory peptide motifs may indeed, be applicable to Aβ and other amyloidogenic systems.",2019-03-30,"Sivanesam, Kalkena; Andersen, Niels",Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/023907d5dbdb76f3e1c3b38622cb60fe98c17479.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7094768.xml.json,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003986118307379; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707943/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003986118307379; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.abb.2019.01.032,73414101.0

AIMS: This was an observational retrospective cohort from electronic medical records of hospitalized patients (n = 2655) with confirmed COVID-19 between February 15, 2020, and April 15, 2020, in 182 hospitals from a large health system in the USA. The review of data yielded to a total of 79 patients in 20 hospitals who had CSF analysis. METHODS: Outcomes during hospitalization, including hospital length of stay, disease severity, ventilator time, and in-hospital death were recorded. Independent variables collected included patient demographics, diagnoses, laboratory values, and procedures. RESULTS: A total of 79 patients underwent CSF analysis. Of these, antigen testing was performed in 73 patients. Ten patients had CSF analysis for general markers such as total protein, cell count, glucose, clarity, and color. Seven of the 10 cases (70%) had normal total cell count and normal white blood cell count in CSF. Sixty-three percent (5/8) had elevated total protein. Two patients had normal levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and 1 patient had significantly elevated (fourfold) neuron-specific enolase (NSE) level in CSF. CONCLUSION: Unlike bacterial infections, viral infections are less likely to cause remarkable changes in CSF glucose, cell count, or protein. Our observations showed no pleocytosis, but mild increase in protein in the CSF of the COVID-19 patients. The fourfold elevation of NSE may have diagnostic/prognostic value as a biomarker in CSF for COVID-19 patients who have altered mental status.",2020,"Toklu, Hale; Ganti, Latha; Crimi, Ettore; Cintron, Cristobal; Hagan, Joshua; Serrano, Enrique",Int J Emerg Med,,#969685,,,,,227930233.0

Without a pharmaceutical solution, governments have been forced to implement regulations and public policies to control social behavior and prevent the spread of the virus. There is dramatic evidence of the social and economic effects of these measures and their disparate impact on vulnerable communities. Individuals living in urban informal settlements are in a structurally disadvantaged position to cope with a health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper examines the socioeconomic impact of the crisis brought by the pandemic in informal settlements in Chile. We use a three-wave panel study to compare the situation in informal settlements before and during the health crisis. We show that households living in informal settlements are paying a high toll. Their employment loss is dramatic, substantially larger than the loss reported in the general population, and has particularly affected the inmigrant population. We also find that the pandemic has triggered neighborhood cooperation within the settlements. Targeted government assistance programs have reached these communities; however, this group's coverage is not enough to counteract the magnitude of the crisis. Our results suggest that governments, the non-profit sector, and the community need to urgently provide economic support and protections to individuals living in informal settlements and consider this opportunity for long-term improvements in these marginalized communities.",2021-01-20,"Gil, D.; Dominguez, P.; Undurraga, E.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety and identify risk and protective factors associated with the presence of anxiety symptoms in the face of COVID-19 among adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in adults from March 2nd to March 16th 2020. The self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) was used to measure the status of anxiety. Unconditional multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the factors associated with anxiety. RESULTS: Among the 7144 respondents, 9.3% met the criteria for anxiety risk based on the SAS. Symptoms of anxiety were more prevalent among farmer (OR=1.43, 95%CI: 1.03-1.99), respondents lived in urban out of Beijing during the COVID-19 outbreak (OR=1.73, 95%CI: 1.14-2.63), and slept less than six hours per day (OR=2.64, 95%CI: 1.96-3.57). Compared to participants who didn’t exercise, a lower risk of anxiety was observed in those exercised 30-60 minutes/day (OR=0.62, 95%CI: 0.41-0.94) and more than 60 minutes/day (OR=0.57, 95%CI: 0.37-0.88).

Studies of postmortem COVID-19 lungs largely report diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and capillary fibrin thrombi, but we have also observed other patterns. OBJECTIVE: To report demographic and radiographic features along with macroscopic, microscopic, and microbiologic postmortem lung findings in patients with COVID-19 infections. DESIGN: Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection and postmortem examination (3/2020-5/2020) were included. Clinical findings were abstracted from medical records. Lungs were microscopically reviewed independently by 4 thoracic pathologists. Imaging studies were reviewed by a thoracic radiologist. RESULTS: Eight patients (7 men, 87.5%; median age of 79 years, range, 69-96) died within a median of 17 days (range, 6-100) from onset of symptoms. The median lung weight was 1,220 g (range, 960-1,760); consolidations were found in 5 of 8 (62.5%) patients; gross thromboemboli were noted in one of 8 (12.5%) patient. Histologically, all patients had acute bronchopneumonia, 6 of 8 (75%) patients had also DAD. Two of 8 (25%) patients had aspiration pneumonia in addition. Thromboemboli, usually scattered and rare, were identified in 5 of 8 (62.5%) patients in small vessels and in two of these patients also in pulmonary arteries. Four of (50%) patients had perivascular chronic inflammation. Postmortem bacterial lung cultures were positive in 4 of 8 (50%) patients. Imaging studies (available in 4 patients) were typical (N=2, 50%), indeterminate (N=1, 25%), or negative (N=1, 25%) for COVID-19 infection.

It begins with a brief review of published scientific studies in support of different causes of seasonality in infectious diseases of humans, identifying four principal mechanisms and their association with different routes of transmission. It then describes the consequences of seasonality for R0, disease outbreaks, endemic dynamics and persistence.

Combinations of markers, as opposed to single ones, may improve diagnosis and thereby survival. We therefore compared the diagnostic characteristics of novel and routinely used biomarkers of sepsis alone and in combination. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome who were suspected of having community-acquired infections. It was conducted in a medical emergency department and department of infectious diseases at a university hospital. A multiplex immunoassay measuring soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator (suPAR) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (sTREM)-1 and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was used in parallel with standard measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and neutrophils. Two composite markers were constructed – one including a linear combination of the three best performing markers and another including all six – and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to compare their performance and those of the individual markers. RESULTS: A total of 151 patients were eligible for analysis. Of these, 96 had bacterial infections. The AUCs for detection of a bacterial cause of inflammation were 0.50 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40 to 0.60) for suPAR, 0.61 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.71) for sTREM-1, 0.63 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.72) for MIF, 0.72 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.79) for PCT, 0.74 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.81) for neutrophil count, 0.81 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.86) for CRP, 0.84 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.91) for the composite three-marker test, and 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.92) for the composite six-marker test. The AUC of the six-marker test was significantly greater than that of the single markers. CONCLUSION: Combining information from several markers improves diagnostic accuracy in detecting bacterial versus nonbacterial causes of inflammation.

Laparoscopic conversion to gastric bypass has been recommended as the procedure of choice. This single-center retrospective study aimed to evaluate the long-term results of revisional gastric bypass after failed adjustable gastric banding. METHODS The study included 108 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic conversion of gastric banding to gastric bypass from 2002 to 2012. Indications for surgery, operative data, weight development, morbidity, and mortality were analyzed. The median follow-up period was 3.4 years (maximum, 10 years). RESULTS The most common indications for band removal were band migration, insufficient weight loss, and pouch dilation. The median interval between gastric banding and gastric bypass was 6.6 years. In 52 % of the cases, band removal and gastric bypass surgery were performed simultaneously as a single-stage laparoscopic procedure. The early postoperative morbidity rate was 10.2 %. The body mass index before gastric banding (43.3 kg/m(2)) decreased significantly to 37.9 kg/m(2) before gastric bypass and to 28.8 kg/m(2) 5 years after gastric bypass.

In this paper, we use a text-to-speech (TTS) engine to provide synthetic audio for out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. We aim to boost the recognition accuracy of a recurrent neural network transducer (RNN-T) on OOV words by using those extra audio-text pairs, while maintaining the performance on the non-OOV words. Different regularisation techniques are explored and the best performance is achieved by fine-tuning the RNN-T on both original training data and extra synthetic data with elastic weight consolidation (EWC) applied on encoder.

Widespread COVID-19 transmission on cruise ships has been reported as well (3). Passengers on certain cruise ship voyages might be aged &#8805;65 years, which places them at greater risk for severe consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection (4). During February-March 2020, COVID-19 outbreaks associated with three cruise ship voyages have caused more than 800 laboratory-confirmed cases among passengers and crew, including 10 deaths. Transmission occurred across multiple voyages of several ships. This report describes public health responses to COVID-19 outbreaks on these ships. COVID-19 on cruise ships poses a risk for rapid spread of disease, causing outbreaks in a vulnerable population, and aggressive efforts are required to contain spread.

While several respiratory illnesses are known to seriously impact pregnant women and newborns, preliminary data on the novel SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus suggest that these groups are no more at-risk than the general population. Here, we review the available literature on newborns born to infected mothers and show that newborns of mothers with positive/suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection rarely acquire the disease or show adverse clinical outcomes. With this evidence in mind, it appears that strict postnatal care policies, including separating mothers and newborns, discouraging breastfeeding, and performing early bathing, may be more likely to adversely impact newborns than they are to reduce the low risk of maternal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 or the even lower risk of severe COVID-19 disease in otherwise healthy newborns.",2020,"Kyle, Margaret H; Glassman, Melissa E; Khan, Adrita; Fernández, Cristina R; Hanft, Erin; Emeruwa, Ukachi N; Scripps, Tessa; Walzer, Lauren; Liao, Grace V; Saslaw, Minna; Rubenstein, David; Hirsch, Daniel S; Keown, M Kathleen; Stephens, Ashley; Mollicone, Isabelle; Bence, Mary L; Gupta, Archana; Sultan, Sally; Sibblies, Caroline; Whittier, Susan; Abreu, Wanda; Akita, Francis; Penn, Anna; Orange, Jordan S; Saiman, Lisa; Welch, Martha G; Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia; Stockwell, Melissa S; Dumitriu, Dani",Semin Perinatol,,#664334,,,,,220688068.0

A Retrospective Nonrandomized Comparative Multicenter Study.,10.1177/1553350618765871,,29577831.0,unk,"BACKGROUND A totally laparoscopic right colectomy could be perceived as a more challenging procedure over a laparoscopic-assisted right colectomy owing to the difficulty of intracorporeal anastomosis and the closure of the enterotomy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the barbed auto-locking absorbable suture for the closure of an anastomotic stapler-access enterotomy during a totally laparoscopic right colectomy. METHODS From January 2010 to April 2016, data from patients who had undergone a laparoscopic right colectomy in 2 different departments of 2 institutions (the Department of General and Minimally Invasive Surgery, San Camillo Hospital in Trento and the Department of Surgical Specialties and Nephrology, University Federico II in Naples) were retrospectively analyzed. We compared the data of patients in whom the stapler-access enterotomy was closed through a conventional absorbable suture (Group A), with the data of patients in whom a stapler-access enterotomy was closed through a V-Loc 180 suture (Group B). Biometric features and intraoperative and postoperative data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS The 2 groups (Group A: 40 patients; Group B: 40 patients) were comparable for biometric features and postoperative outcomes. The anastomosing time was lower in Group B. A statistically significant difference was noted in the mean operative time between Groups A and B (Group A = 134.92 ± 34.17; Group B = 120.92 ± 23.27, P = .035). Only one anastomotic leakage per group was recorded, each treated with an anastomosis redo. During the reoperations, we find in both groups an intact stapler-access enterotomy. CONCLUSION On retrospective analysis, barbed suture appears to be safe and efficient for closure of the stapler-access enterotomy during totally laparoscopic right colectomy.",2018,"Bracale, Umberto; Merola, Giovanni; Cabras, Francesco; Andreuccetti, Jacopo; Corcione, Francesco; Pignata, Giusto",Surgical innovation,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350618765871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29577831/,4330537.0

Reliable forecasts could also aid in the selection and implementation of interventions to reduce morbidity and mortality due to influenza illness.

We discuss the various approaches, in addition to the variability in measures of accuracy and precision of predicted measures. PubMed and Google Scholar searches for articles on influenza forecasting retrieved sixteen studies that matched the study criteria. We focused on studies that aimed at forecasting influenza outbreaks at the local, regional, national, or global level. The selected studies spanned a wide range of regions including USA, Sweden, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, United Kingdom, Canada, France, and Cuba. The methods were also applied to forecast a single measure or multiple measures. Typical measures predicted included peak timing, peak height, daily/weekly case counts, and outbreak magnitude. Due to differences in measures used to assess accuracy, a single estimate of predictive error for each of the measures was difficult to obtain. However, collectively, the results suggest that these diverse approaches to influenza forecasting are capable of capturing specific outbreak measures with some degree of accuracy given reliable data and correct disease assumptions.

A partial cDNA clone of the M segment which contains G1 and G2 glycoprotein coding sequences but lacks most of the NSM sequences was inserted into the genome of vaccinia virus under the control of an early vaccinia promoter. Cells infected with the recombinant virus were found to synthesize two polypeptides with molecular weights of 65,000 (G1) and 55,000 (G2) that reacted specifically with antibody against PTV. Studies using indirect immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that these proteins accumulated intracellularly in the perinuclear region. The results of endoglycosidase H digestion of these glycoproteins suggested that both G1 and G2 glycoproteins were transported from the RER to the Golgi complex. These proteins were not chased out from the Golgi region during a 6-hr incubation in the presence of cycloheximide.

To determine whether the 3'-end sequence is also involved in subgenomic mRNA transcription, we have constructed MHV defective interfering (DI) RNAs which contain a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene placed behind an intergenic sequence and a 3'-end sequence with various degrees of internal deletions. The DI RNAs were transfected into MHV-infected cells, and CAT activities, which represent subgenomic mRNA transcription from the intergenic site, were determined. The results demonstrated that the deletions of sequence upstream of the 350 nt at the 3'-end, which include the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), of MHV genomic RNA did not affect subgenomic mRNA transcription. However, deletions that reduced the 3'-end sequences to 270 nt or less completely abolished the mRNA transcription despite the fact that all of these clones synthesized minus-strand RNAs. These results indicated that mRNA transcription from an intergenic site in the MHV DI RNA requires most of the 3'-UTR as a cis-acting signal, which likely exerts its effects during plus-strand RNA synthesis. A substitution of the corresponding bovine coronavirus sequence for the MHV sequence within nt 270 to 305 from the 3'-end abrogated the CAT gene expression, suggesting a very rigid sequence requirement in this region. The deletion of a putative pseudoknot structure within the 3'-UTR also abolished the CAT gene expression.

METHODS: Factors that contributed to the emergence of recent outbreaks have been reviewed. Known, major outbreaks over the past two decades were reviewed. RESULTS: We identified at least four major drivers of emergent infections: (i) increasing density of the human population; (ii) stress from farmland expansion on the environment; (iii) globalization of the food market and manufacturing; (iv) environmental contamination. The factors creating new opportunities for emerging infections include: (i) population growth; (ii) spread in health care facilities; (iii) an ageing population; (iv) international travel; (v) changing and expanding vector habitats. CONCLUSIONS: Emerging infections are unpredictable. In this review we argue that to discover new trends in infectious diseases, the clinicians have to look for the unusual and unexpected and ensure proper diagnostics and that syndromic surveillance must be supported by highly specialized laboratory services. Mathematical modeling has not been able to predict outbreaks More emphasis on the biology of evolution is needed.

Several governments issued restrictions on inbound flights to mitigate such risk. But with the pandemic controlled in many countries, some decide to reopen the economy by relaxing the international air travel bans. As the virus has still been prevailing in many regions, this relaxation raises the alarm to import overseas cases and results in the revival of local pandemic. This study proposes a risk index to measure one country's imported case risk from inbound international flights. The index combines both daily dynamic international air connectivity data and the updating global COVID-19 data. It can measure the risk at the country, province and even specific route level. The proposed index was applied to China, which is the first country to experience and control COVID-19 pandemic but later becoming exposed to high imported case risk after the pandemic centers switched to Europe and the US afterward. The calculated risk indexes for each Chinese province or region show both spatial and temporal patterns from January to April 2020. It is found that China's strict restriction on inbound flights since March 26 was very effective to reduce the imported case risk by half than doing nothing. But the overall index level kept rising because of the deteriorating pandemic around the world. Hong Kong and Taiwan are the regions facing the highest imported case risk due to their superior international air connectivity and looser restriction on inbound flights. Shandong Province had the highest risk in February and early March due to its well-developed air connectivity with South Korea and Japan when the pandemic peaked in these two countries. Since mid-March, the imported case risk from Europe and the US dramatically increased. Last, we discuss policy implications for the relevant stakeholders to use our index to dynamically adjust the international air travel restrictions.

METHODS: In order to address this need, we created a downloadable pedagogical video content through first-person point-of-view to rapidly train users on COVID-19 procedures in the Revinax® Handbook mobile App. Eight new tutorials were designed through this technology platform to assist healthcare workers/responders caring for COVID-19 patients. A survey was then sent to assess their interest. RESULTS: In one-month since the App was created, it was downloaded by 12,516 users and a feedback survey determined that the users valued the tutorials in helping them learn COVID-19 procedures efficiently in real-time. The fast-growing number of downloads and positive user feedback evidences that we created a valuable educational tool with an emergent- and growing-demand. DISCUSSION: The 71.48% App user response rate, showed largely positive feedback of the COVID-19 tutorial. The fact that these healthcare workers/responders took the time to complete the survey during a pandemic was indicative of its immediate value. Further, the App users indicated that they FPV tutorial was rather helpful in addressing their training needs regarding their roles in COVID-19 patient care during the pandemic.

This provides challenges for the use of secondary prevention measures in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this Position Statement is to review the implications for effective delivery of secondary prevention strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. CHALLENGES: The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced limitations for many patients to access standard health services such as visits to health care professionals, medications, imaging and blood tests as well as attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. In addition, the pandemic is having an impact on lifestyle habits and mental health. Taken together, this has the potential to adversely impact the ability of practitioners and patients to adhere to treatment guidelines for the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events. RECOMMENDATIONS: Every effort should be made to deliver safe, ongoing access to health care professionals and the use of evidenced based therapies in individuals with CVD. An increase in use of a range of electronic health platforms has the potential to transform secondary prevention. Integrating research programs that evaluate the utility of these approaches may provide important insights into how to develop more optimal approaches to secondary prevention beyond the pandemic.",2020,"Nicholls, Stephen J; Nelson, Mark; Astley, Carolyn; Briffa, Tom; Brown, Alex; Clark, Robyn; Colquhoun, David; Gallagher, Robyn; Hare, David L; Inglis, Sally; Jelinek, Michael; O039,; Neil, Adrienne; Tirimacco, Rosy; Vale, Margarite; Redfern, Julie",Heart Lung Circ,,#155330,,,,,216929758.0

These observations raise the possibility that the recruitment of mononuclear cells into the CNS may play a critical role in survival from a lethal CNS infection. Transient DTH response to nonviral antigens induced an accumulation of monocytes in the CNS that was maximal at 48 h post-challenge and virtually resolved by 5 days post-challenge. By contrast the induction of prolonged DTH responses resulted in the accumulation of a large number monocytes that persisted in the CNS for at least 5 days post-challenge.

The projections containing high resolution information are usually very noisy. This paper proposes a new method, based on weighted-projection matching in wavelet space for virus orientation determination. In order to speed the retrieval of the best match between projections from a model and real virus particle, a hierarchical correlation matching method is also proposed. RESULTS: A data set of 600 HSV-1 capsid particle images in different orientations was used to test the proposed method. An initial model of about 40 Å resolutions was used to generate projections of an HSV-1 capsid. Results show that a significant improvement, in terms of accuracy and speed, is obtained for the initial orientation estimates of noisy herpes virus images. For the bacteriophage (P22), the proposed method gave the correct reconstruction compared to the model, while the classical method failed to resolve the correct orientations of the smooth spherical P22 viruses. CONCLUSION: This paper introduces a new method for orientation determination of low contrast images and highly noisy virus particles. This method is based on weighted projection matching in wavelet space, which increases the accuracy of the orientations. A hierarchical implementation of this method increases the speed of orientation determination. The estimated number of particles needed for a higher resolution reconstruction increased exponentially. For a 6 Å resolution reconstruction of the HSV virus, 50,000 particles are necessary. The results show that the proposed method reduces the amount of data needed in a reconstruction by at least 50 %. This may result in savings 2 to 3 man-years invested in acquiring images from the microscope and data processing. Furthermore, the proposed method is able to determine orientations for some difficult particles like P22 with accuracy and consistency.

To this effect, we employed three sets of primers specifically designed for amplification of nucleic acids under isothermal conditions. After optimization of reaction conditions, M. hyopneumoniae could be successfully detected at 63°C in 45 min through use of the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. A positive reaction was identified visually as white precipitate and confirmed by gel electrophoresis. The detection limit for this assay was 10 copies/μL, as observed by electrophoretic analysis. The accuracy of the LAMP reaction was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion as well as by direct sequencing of the amplified product. This method can specifically detect M. hyopneumoniae; other species with high homology and other bacterial and virus strains gave negative results. To test the utility of this procedure, the LAMP assay was applied to 40 clinical samples collected from swine lung tissues experimentally challenged with M. hyopneumoniae isolates, and compared to the results from a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay.

Here we propose a neurophysiological account attributing these perceptual capacity limits directly to limits on cerebral cellular metabolism. We hypothesized that overall cerebral energy supply remains constant, irrespective of mental task demand, and therefore an attention mechanism is required to regulate cellular metabolism levels in line with task demands. Increased perceptual load in a task (imposing a greater demand on neural computations) should thus result in increased metabolism underlying attended processing, and reduced metabolism mediating unattended processing. We tested this prediction measuring oxidation states of cytochrome c oxidase (oxCCO), an intracellular marker of cellular metabolism. Broadband near-infrared spectroscopy was used to record oxCCO levels from human visual cortex while participants (both sexes) performed a rapid sequential visual search task under either high perceptual load (complex feature-conjunction search) or low load (feature pop-out search). A task-irrelevant, peripheral checkerboard was presented on a random half of trials. Our findings showed that oxCCO levels in visual cortex regions responsive to the attended-task stimuli were increased in high versus low perceptual load, while oxCCO levels related to unattended processing were significantly reduced. A negative temporal correlation of these load effects further supported our metabolism trade-off account. These results demonstrate an attentional compensation mechanism that regulates cellular metabolism levels according to processing demands. Moreover, they provide novel evidence for the widely-held stipulation that overall cerebral metabolism levels remain constant irrespective of mental task demand and establish a neurophysiological account for capacity limits in perception.Significance StatementWe investigated whether capacity limits in perception can be explained by the effects of attention on the allocation of limited cellular metabolic energy for perceptual processing. We measured the oxidation state of cytochrome c oxidase, an intracellular measure of metabolism, in human visual cortex during task performance. The results showed increased levels of cellular metabolism associated with attended processing and reduced levels of metabolism underlying unattended processing when the task was more demanding. A temporal correlation between these effects supported an attention-directed metabolism trade-off. These findings support an account for inattentional blindness grounded in cellular biochemistry. They also provide novel evidence for the claim that cerebral processing is limited by a constant energy supply, which thus requires attentional regulation.",2020-07-24,"Bruckmaier, Merit; Tachtsidis, Ilias; Phan, Phong; Lavie, Nilli",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2368-19.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747442/,221324435.0

Here, we studied 181 COVIDpos and 7,775 COVIDneg patients subjected to 1.3 million laboratory tests across 194 assays during a two-month observation period centered around their SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing dates. We found that compared to COVIDneg at the time of clinical presentation and diagnostic testing, COVIDpos patients tended to have higher plasma fibrinogen levels and similarly low platelet counts, with approximately 25% of patients in both cohorts showing outright thrombocytopenia. However, these measures show opposite longitudinal trends as the infection evolves, with declining fibrinogen and increasing platelet counts to levels that are lower and higher compared to the COVIDneg cohort, respectively. Our EHR augmented curation efforts suggest a minority of patients develop thromboembolic events after the PCR testing date, including rare cases with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), with most patients lacking the platelet reductions typically observed in consumptive coagulopathies. These temporal trends present, for the first time, fine-grained resolution of COVID-19 associated coagulopathy (CAC), via a digital framework that synthesizes longitudinal lab measurements with structured medication data and neural network-powered extraction of outcomes from the unstructured EHR.

The attitude towards performing surgery is influenced by the pandemic. Setting special recommendations for safe cardiothoracic surgery is of extreme importance. METHODS: This was an observational cross-sectional survey that included 77 Egyptian cardiothoracic surgeons. The survey consisted of a self-administered constructed questionnaire with six sections, and was delivered as a Google Forms questionnaire (https://www.google.com/forms/about) that was sent to individuals via social networks and email. RESULTS: More than 80% of Egyptian cardiothoracic surgeons believe they and their patients are at risk. Out of all participants, none had actually been infected with COVID-19 but 26% had encountered a positive COVID-19 person in their surgical team. Although 51% were testing patients before surgery, they reported 9 confirmed cases postoperatively. Computed tomography was the most recommended investigation prior to surgery (by 69%). Most had postponed elective surgeries and only one-third of all surgeons recommended performing elective surgeries cautiously with pretesting for COVID-19 and maximizing protective measures, while more than 40% recommended not performing high-risk elective surgeries. CONCLUSION: We are committed to the safety of our patients, ourselves, our staff, and our families.

Although HCQ is generally considered safe during pregnancy based on studies in patients with systemic lupus erythematous and other rheumatic conditions, there may still be reluctance to institute this antimalarial during pregnancy for the sole purpose of antiviral therapy. Methods - To provide data regarding any potential fetal/neonatal cardiotoxicity, we leveraged a unique opportunity in which neonatal electrocardiograms (ECGs) and HCQ blood levels were available in a recently completed study evaluating the efficacy of HCQ 400mg daily to prevent the recurrence of congenital heart block associated with anti-SSA/Ro antibodies. Results - Forty-five ECGs were available for QTc measurement, and levels of HCQ were assessed during each trimester of pregnancy and in the cord blood, providing unambiguous assurance of drug exposure. Overall, there was no correlation between cord blood levels of HCQ and the neonatal QTc (R = 0.02, P = 0.86) or the mean of HCQ values obtained throughout each individual pregnancy and the QTc (R = 0.04, P = 0.80). In total 5 (11%; 95% CI: 4% - 24%) neonates had prolongation of the QTc > 2SD above historical healthy controls (2 markedly and 3 marginally) but ECGs were otherwise normal.

Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the psychological impact of lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic on the general public with an objective to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, well-being, and other psychological issues. Materials and Methods: It was an online survey conducted under the aegis of the Indian Psychiatry Society. Using the Survey Monkey platform, a survey link was circulated using the Whatsapp. The survey questionnaire included perceived stress scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale to assess perceived stress, anxiety, depression, and mental well-being, respectively. The survey link was circulated starting from April 6, 2020 and was closed on April 24, 2020. Results: During the survey, a total of 1871 responses were collected, of which 1685 (90.05%) responses were analyzed. About two-fifth (38.2%) had anxiety and 10.5% of the participants had depression. Overall, 40.5% of the participants had either anxiety or depression. Moderate level of stress was reported by about three-fourth (74.1%) of the participants and 71.7% reported poor well-being. Conclusions: The present survey suggests that more than two-fifths of the people are experiencing common mental disorders, due to lockdown and the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic. This finding suggests that there is a need for expanding mental health services to everyone in the society during this pandemic situation.",2020,"Grover, Sandeep; Sahoo, Swapnajeet; Mehra, Aseem; Avasthi, Ajit; Tripathi, Adarsh; Subramanyan, Alka; Pattojoshi, Amrit; Rao, G Prasad; Saha, Gautam; Mishra, K K; Chakraborty, Kaustav; Rao, Naren P; Vaishnav, Mrugesh; Singh, Om Prakash; Dalal, P K; Chadda, Rakesh K; Gupta, Ravi; Gautam, Shiv; Sarkar, Siddharth; Sathyanarayana Rao, T S; Kumar, Vinay; Janardran Reddy, Y C",Indian J Psychiatry,,#738100,,,,,220923352.0

Proteolytic processing of the RV NSP ORF translation product p200 is essential for viral replication. Processing of p200 to two mature products (p150 and p90) in the order NH(2)-p150-p90-COOH is carried out by an RV-encoded protease residing in the C-terminal region of p150. The RV nonstructural protease (NS-pro) belongs to a viral papain-like protease family that cleaves the polyprotein both in trans and in cis. A conserved X domain of unknown function was found from previous sequence analysis to be associated with NS-pro. To define the domains responsible for cis- and trans-cleavage activities and the function of the X domain in terms of protease activity, an in vitro translation system was employed. We demonstrated that the NSP region from residue 920 to 1296 is necessary for trans-cleavage activity. The domain from residue 920 to 1020 is not required for cis-cleavage activity. The X domain located between residues 834 and 940, outside the regions responsible for both cis- and trans-cleavage activities of NS-pro, was found to be important for NS-pro trans-cleavage activity but not for cis-cleavage activity.

However, the underlying mechanism remains to be further clarified. Here, we have identified that M1, an alphavirus isolated in 1960s, targeted C6 malignant glioma cells for apoptosis. Flow cytometry analysis showed that more cells enter S-phase post M1 infection, and subsequently undergo a classic apoptosis. To elucidate the mechanism of S-phase arrest and its relationship to apoptosis, we tested the expression of several critical cell cycle regulatory proteins and found elevated phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), decreased expression of cyclin A and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Notably, the protein level of p21(WAF1/CIP1) was downregulated earliest and most effectively among all tested changes of cell cycle regulators, though its mRNA level was strongly upregulated. To evaluate the role of p21(WAF1/CIP1) in S-phase accumulation and subsequent apoptosis, we confirmed that exogenous p21(WAF1/CIP1) overexpression or treatment with roscovitine (a selective chemical inhibitor of CDK2) efficiently protected against apoptosis with a reduced S-phase accumulation. Thus, it is indicated that the downregulation of p21(WAF1/CIP1) mediated C6 apoptosis via overactivation of CDK2. In addition, confocal microscopy showed that p21(WAF1/CIP1) totally translocated to nucleolus during M1-induced C6 apoptosis. Altogether, downregulation and nucleolar translocation of the p21(WAF1/CIP1) protein played an active role in M1-induced C6 apoptosis.",2009,"Hu, Jun; Cai, Xiao-Feng; Yan, Guangmei",Cell cycle,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19770587/,11866993.0

STUDY DESIGN: Using online searches, we collected state-level documents from all 50 states and the District of Columbia discussing reopening plans for K-12 schools in the 2020-2021 academic year. We examined whether these documents explicitly mentioned equity as a concern, as well as if and how they addressed the following equity issues: food insecurity and child nutrition, homelessness or temporary housing, lack of access to Internet/technology, students with disabilities or special needs, English-language learners, students involved with or on the verge of involvement with the Department of Children and Family Services or an equivalent agency, mental health support, students/staff at greater risk of severe illness from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and students/staff living with someone at greater risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Forty-four of 51 states (86%) explicitly mentioned equity as a concern or guiding principle. At least 90% of states offered guidance for 7 equity issues. Fewer than 75% of states addressed homelessness or temporary housing, students involved with or on the verge of involvement with Department of Children and Family Services or an equivalent agency, and students/staff living with someone at greater risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection.

More than half of the MSM PrEP users in Taiwan prefer on-demand PrEP; however, on-demand PrEP involves a complicated dosing regimen because it requires precoital and postcoital dosing and sex events are hard to anticipate. Although there are a growing number of mobile apps designed to improve access to HIV prevention services and HIV medication adherence, few mobile apps focus on adherence to PrEP or are designed to accommodate a complicated, on-demand PrEP dosing schedule. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this project is to evaluate the usability of a newly developed mobile app (UPrEPU) to assist MSM PrEP users to self-monitor their adherence to either daily or on-demand PrEP using a user-centered scheme. METHODS: This research will be conducted in 2 phases: app development and usability study. In the app development phase, we will first conduct formative research with end users and stakeholders through in-depth interviews; the results will provide PrEP users’ and PrEP navigators’ personas as material used in the app conceptualization stage. PrEP navigators are individuals in the health care system that help HIV-negative individuals who need assistance in accessing PrEP care. A low-fidelity prototype of the app feature will be formatted by applying a participatory design approach to engage PrEP users, designers, and app developers in the design process of the app. Then, a high-fidelity prototype of the app will be developed for the usability study and refined iteratively by the multidisciplinary team and new internal testers. Internal testers include the research team consisting of experts in public health, infectious disease, and industrial design and a close network of the research team that is taking PrEP. In the usability study phase, we will enroll 70 MSM PrEP users and follow them up for 4 months. Usability, feasibility, and effectiveness of adherence monitoring will be evaluated. RESULTS: Refinement of the UPrEPU app is currently ongoing. The usability study commenced in May 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The UPrEPU app is one of the first apps designed to help MSM PrEP users to self-manage their PrEP schedule better regardless of dosing modes. With a design-thinking approach and adapting to the cultural context in Taiwan’s MSM population, this novel app will have substantial potential to be acceptable and feasible and contribute to the reduction of new HIV infections.

A total of 11,000 doses of influenza vaccine, single-dose prefilled syringes, were provided free to HCWs at 29 selected hospitals, clinics, and research institutes in four provinces: Hanoi, Khanh Hoa, Dak Lak and Ho Chi Minh City. METHODS: Before the campaign, a workshop was organized to discuss an implementation plan including technical requirements, cold chain, uptake reporting, and surveillance for adverse events following immunization. All sites distributed communication materials and encouraged their staff to register for vaccination. Following immunization sessions, sites sent reports on uptake and adverse events following immunization. Left-over vaccine was transferred to other sites to maximize vaccine use. RESULTS: The average uptake was 57% for all health care workers, with 11 sites achieving 90% and above. These 11 sites were small with less than 500 staff, including 5 primary hospitals, 3 preventive medicine units, and 2 referral hospitals. Among the six biggest sites with over 1000 staff, four sites had the lowest uptake (14–47%). Most of the high-uptake sites were from the central to the south; only one site, a referral hospital, was from the north. After redistribution of left-over vaccine, only 130 vaccine doses (1.2%) were not used and destroyed. Based on factors that affected uptake, including registration levels, differing communication strategies, availability of vaccination, and commitment by health facility leaders, we recommended ways to increase health care worker coverage; recommendations to improve reporting adverse events following immunization were also made. CONCLUSIONS: The project demonstrated that it was feasible to conduct influenza vaccination campaigns among health care workers in Vietnam. Improvements in promotion of registration, more intense pre-planning, especially at larger facilities, and wider, more consistent availability of communication materials will result in increased efficiency and coverage in this program’s future expansion.",2020-08-24,"Ha, Nga T.; Nguyen, Thoa T.

METHODS: In this prospective, single-center study, we enrolled ambulatory outpatients with COVID-19 confirmed by a molecular method who received hydroxychloroquine. The patients were divided into low- and moderate-risk groups based on the Tisdale risk score for drug-associated QT prolongation, and the QT interval was corrected for heart rate using the Bazett formula (QTc). The QTc interval was measured by electrocardiography both pretreatment (QTc1) and 4 h after the administration of hydroxychloroquine (QTc2). The difference between the QTc1 and QTc2 intervals was defined as the ΔQTc. The QTc1 and QTc2 intervals and ΔQTc values were compared between the two risk groups. RESULTS: The median and interquartile range (IQR) age of the patients was 47.0 (36.2–62) years, and there were 78 men and 74 women. The median (IQR) QTc1 interval lengthened from 425.0 (407.2–425.0) to 430.0 (QTc2; 412.0–443.0) milliseconds (ms). However, this was not considered an increased risk of ventricular tachycardia associated with a prolonged QTc interval requiring drug discontinuation, because none of the patients had a ΔQTc of >60 ms or a QTc2 of >500 ms. Moreover, the median (quartiles; minimum-maximum) ΔQTc value was higher in patients in the moderate-risk group than those in the low-risk group (10.0 [−4.0–18.0; −75.0–51.0] vs. 7.0 [−10.5–23.5; −53.0–59.0 ms]) (p = 0.996). Clinical improvement was noted in 91.4% of the patients, the exceptions being 13 patients who presented with non-serious adverse drug reactions or who had severe COVID-19 and were hospitalized. Adverse effects related to hydroxychloroquine were non-serious and occurred in 52.8% (n = 80) of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that hydroxychloroquine is safe for COVID-19 and not associated with a risk of ventricular arrhythmia due to drug-induced QTc interval prolongation.

RESULTS We included 234 allo-HSCT recipients with 383 EvRh episodes. Out of 383 EvRh episodes, 98 (25%) had LRTD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified three independent factors associated with LRTD progression: Ig G <400 mg/dl, community-acquired respiratory virus (CARV) co-infection and high-risk ISI. Inclusion of Ig G levels and CARV co-infection in the ISI improved its performance by significantly increasing the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) from 0.643 to 0.734 (p= 0.03).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 6th to April 22nd 2020, all consecutive adult patients referred to the ""Covid-19 clinic"" of our Emergency Department with the availability of chest CT and of at least one RT-PCR result were retrospectively included in the present study. Chest CT was considered positive when typical Covid-19 lesions were observed (bilateral and predominantly peripheral and sub-pleural ground glass opacities and/or alveolar consolidations). RT-PCR results were considered as the reference standard. Ascending, peak and descending phases were determined based on the number of CT scans performed daily.

Design: A hospital-based case-control study. Setting: This case-control investigation was done in 2011. Usual dietary intakes of participants during the preceding year were examined using a food frequency questionnaire. Data on dietary TAC from foods was gathered from published databases that provided the antioxidant capacity for each food item, measured by ferric reducing antioxidant power. Participants: Cases were individuals with pathologically confirmed glioma that were diagnosed during the last month (n = 128). Controls were individuals, aged between 20 and 75 years, who were hospitalized or were outpatients referred to other wards of the same hospitals (n = 256). Results: Compared with participants in the lowest quartile, those in the highest quartile of dietary TAC had a lower odds of glioma (OR: 0.28, 95%CI: 0.15-0.45). This association was strengthened when potential confounders were taken into account (OR: 0.13; 95%CI: 0.05-0.35). Such inverse association was also seen for men (OR: 0.05, 95%CI: 0.01-0.19), but not for women. Furthermore, significant inverse associations were seen between dietary intakes of vitamin C (OR for Q 4 vs. Q 1: 0.14, 95%CI: 0.05-0.36; P-trend < 0.01), vitamin B6 (OR for Q 4 vs. Q 1: 0.35, 95%CI: 0.13-0.97; P-trend = 0.02) and ß-carotene (OR for Q 3 vs. Q 1: 0.43, 95%CI: 0.19-0.98; P-trend = 0.57) and glioma, after controlling for potential covariates.

METHODS: An online self-administered questionnaire was distributed among residents in the Saudi ophthalmology training programs between July 7 and 14, 2020. In this study, we explored residents’ opinions regarding training disruption and virtual education. The patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on their mental health. We used descriptive statistics for data analysis. RESULTS: Out of 183 registered ophthalmology residents, 142 participated in this study. Ninety-six participants (35.4%) were rotated at a specialized eye hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic, while 52 (19.2%) had rotations in the ophthalmology department at general hospitals. Those who rotated in both types of hospitals were 123 (45.4%). According to the participants, there was a significant decline in exposure to surgical and office-based procedures compared to emergency eye consultations (Friedman P <0.001). The COVID-19 pandemic’s effect on mental health was reported by 100 (70.5%) participants. Eighty-five (55.4%) respondents were satisfied with the virtual method of education. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted residents’ clinical and surgical training in the Saudi ophthalmology training programs.

There is no effective intervention for the severe patients, and their prognosis is poor. It is worth noting that in the fight against COVID-19, China has always put equal emphasis on both Chinese and Western medicine. Traditional Chinese medicine has played an important role in the whole process. It is of great significance to discuss the rules and characteristics of the prescription of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of COVID-19. In this study, information was collected from 444 severe COVID-19 patients who were admitted to a hospital designated to treat patients with severe COVID-19 in Wuhan before March 20, 2020. We collected traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions for patients with severe COVID-19, referred to Chinese Pharmacopoeia to standardize the names of traditional Chinese medicine, and extract the property, flavor and channel tropism of traditional Chinese medicines to analyze the rules of the prescriptions. IBM SPSS Modeler 18.0 software was used to conduct correlation analysis of traditional Chinese medicine. Effective traditional Chinese medicines against COVID-19 was identified by the TCMATCOV platform. In the end, 1 532 effective prescriptions were included. Among them, the high-frequency drugs are Poria, Astragali Radix, Pogostemonis Herba, Armeniacae Semen Amarum, Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma, Pinelliae Rhizoma, Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Ephedrae Herba, Cinna-momi Ramulus. Most of the drugs have the following functions: resolving dampness, replenishing deficiency, resolving phlegm, cough, and asthma. The core combinations are Pogostemonis Herba-Poria, Astragali Radix-Pogostemonis Herba-Poria, Amomi Fructus-Poria, Amomi Fructus-Pogostemonis Herba, Amomi Fructus-Astragali Radix. The majority of the medicines are with cold and warm properties, and the proportions are 41.03% and 38.46%, respectively. The medicinal flavors are mainly concentrated in sweet and bitter, and the proportions are 34.71% and 30.58%, respectively. The meridian of the drug is more into the lung, stomach and spleen, with lung accounting for 22.87%. From the analysis of high-frequency drugs to the core combinations, one can see that the main treatment principle for severe COVID-19 is to remove internal and external dampness, protect the spleen and stomach, remove evil energy, and support righteousness. TCMATCOV platform was used to calculate the network disturbances of the high-frequency drugs. It was found that the traditional Chinese medicine with a high disturbance score accounted for a high proportion of the classic anti-COVID-19 prescriptions used by clinicians. Among them, the drugs with top scores are Ephedrae Herba, Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium, Eupatorii Herba, Platycodonis Radix, Cinnamomi Ramulus, Astragali Radix, Magnoliae Officinalis Cortex, Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma, Pogostemonis Herba, Scutellariae Radix.

We selected operational ROC point at a sensitivity of 81.9% and specificity of 97.9%. The cross-validated area under the curve (AUC) was 0.97. The five most useful routine blood parameters for COVID19 diagnosis according to the feature importance scoring of the XGBoost algorithm were MCHC, eosinophil count, albumin, INR, and prothrombin activity percentage. tSNE visualization showed that the blood parameters of the patients with severe COVID-19 course are more like the parameters of bacterial than viral infection. The reported diagnostic accuracy is at least comparable and probably complementary to RT-PCR and chest CT studies. Patients with fever, cough, myalgia, and other symptoms can now have initial routine blood tests assessed by our diagnostic tool.

Models that account for noise in disease transmission compare favourably. We further evaluate how robust estimates are to different choices of epidemiological parameters and data. Focusing on models that assume transmission noise, we find that previously published results are remarkably robust across these variables.

An essential packaging signal component of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) has been further delimited to the first 598 nucleotides (nt) from the 5' end of its RNA genome, by using recombinant viruses transcribing subgenomic mRNA that included potential packaging signals. The integrity of the entire sequence domain was necessary because deletion of any of the five structural motifs defined within this region abrogated specific packaging of this viral RNA. One of these RNA motifs was the stem-loop SL5, a highly conserved motif in coronaviruses located at nucleotide positions 106 to 136. Partial deletion or point mutations within this motif also abrogated packaging. Using TGEV-derived defective minigenomes replicated in trans by a helper virus, we have shown that TGEV RNA packaging is a replication-independent process. Furthermore, the last 494 nt of the genomic 3' end were not essential for packaging, although this region increased packaging efficiency. TGEV RNA sequences identified as necessary for viral genome packaging were not sufficient to direct packaging of a heterologous sequence derived from the green fluorescent protein gene. These results indicated that TGEV genome packaging is a complex process involving many factors in addition to the identified RNA packaging signal. The identification of well-defined RNA motifs within the TGEV RNA genome that are essential for packaging will be useful for designing packaging-deficient biosafe coronavirus-derived vectors and providing new targets for antiviral therapies.",2013,"Morales, Lucia; Mateos-Gomez, Pedro A; Capiscol, Carmen; del Palacio, Lorena; Enjuanes, Luis; Sola, Isabel",Journal of virology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01836-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23966403/,23116989.0

Nuclear receptor-related 1 protein (Nurr1) is a nuclear hormone receptor implicated in limiting mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and inflammation in the central nervous system and protecting dopaminergic neurons and a promising therapeutic target for PD. Cicadidae Periostracum (CP), the cast-off skin of Cryptotympana pustulata Fabricius, has been used in traditional medicine for its many clinical pharmacological effects, including the treatment of psychological symptoms in PD. However, scientific evidence for the use of CP in neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, is lacking. Here, we investigated the protective effects of CP on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine- (MPTP-) induced PD in mice and explored the underlying mechanisms of action, focusing on Nurr1. CP increased the expression levels of Nurr1, tyrosine hydroxylase, DOPA decarboxylase, dopamine transporter, and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 via extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in differentiated PC12 cells and the mouse SNPC. In MPTP-induced PD, CP promoted recovery from movement impairments. CP prevented dopamine depletion and protected against dopaminergic neuronal degradation via mitochondria-mediated apoptotic proteins such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X, cytochrome c, and cleaved caspase-9 and caspase-3 by inhibiting MPTP-induced neuroinflammatory cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase, cyclooxygenase 2, and glial/microglial activation. Moreover, CP inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced neuroinflammatory cytokines and response levels and glial/microglial activation in BV2 microglia and the mouse brain. Our findings suggest that CP might contribute to neuroprotective signaling by regulating neurotrophic factors primarily via Nurr1 signaling, neuroinflammation, and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis.",2019-10-24,"Lim, Hye-Sun; Kim, Joong-Sun; Moon, Byeong Cheol; Choi, Goya; Ryu, Seung Mok; Lee, Jun; Ang, Mary Jasmin; Jeon, Mijin; Moon, Changjong; Park, Gunhyuk",Oxid Med Cell Longev,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/bd6dd93085fa736cac9569090a8cb88324daf18f.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6854990.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/5797512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31772707/,208072783.0

METHODS We reviewed clinical and imaging data of consecutive patients attending our center for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) between January 2012 and November 2017. IAD was defined according to published criteria and our own angiographic criteria (no clot following MT, and normalization of the vessel caliber after stenting). RESULTS IAD was retrospectively diagnosed in 13/391 (3%) patients (inter-rater agreement κ=0.885, P<0.001). It was an extending of extracranial dissection in 7/13 (54%) patients. A total of 21 recanalization approaches (with or without IV tissue plasminogen activator) were analyzed in 13 patients. A medical approach was used in 7/21 (33%), MT in 7/21 (33%) (stent retriever=6, thromboaspiration=1), and permanent stenting in 7/21 (33%). A rescue recanalization was necessary after 8/14 (57%) approaches without stenting. Stenting was associated with a best rate of recanalization (P=0.001) and with a trend towards a lower rate of ischemic recurrence (P=0.057). Stenting of a circulating false lumen failed to recanalize the artery in two patients. At the last follow-up, no patient had developed a subarachnoid hemorrhage due to the dissection. The outcome at 3 months was favorable in 8/13 (62%) patients. One patient died at 3 weeks owing to a severe cerebellar infarction. CONCLUSION IAD is a rare diagnosis that should be systematically considered in patients with intracranial large vessel occlusion, especially in patients with extracranial artery dissection and when MT does not retrieve any clot. Stenting of IAD as first-line approach should be assessed in further studies.",2018,"Labeyrie, Marc-Antoine; Civelli, Vittorio; Reiner, Peggy; Aymard, Armand; Saint-Maurice, Jean-Pierre; Zetchi, Akli; Houdart, Emmanuel",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2018-013763; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29511116/,207017447.0

Identifying poor prognostic factors is helpful for risk stratification. In this meta-analysis, we investigated the association between severe COVID-19 and a change in white blood cell (WBC) count, an elevation of C-reactive protein (CRP), and fever. Moreover, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of leukocytosis and an elevation of CRP. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library through April 20th, 2020. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. A sensitivity analysis was conducted according to the study size (>200 or <200) and median age (>55 or <55). Meta-regression analyses were conducted to examine possible sources of heterogeneity. We calculated the diagnostic accuracy of leukocytosis and CRP. RESULTS: Eighteen studies with 3278 patients were selected. Fever, leukocytosis, and elevated CRP were associated with poor outcomes (OR (95% CI) 1.63 (1.06-2.51), 4.51 (2.53-8.04), and 11.97 (4.97-28.8), respectively). Leukopenia was associated with a better prognosis (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40-0.78). Sensitivity analyses showed similar tendencies. Meta-regression analysis for leukocytosis indicated that age, dyspnea, and hypertension contributed to heterogeneity. The pooled area under the leukocytosis and CRP curves were 0.70 (0.64-0.76) and 0.89 (0.80-0.99), respectively.

We aimed to quantify the impact of several public health measures including non-medical mask-wearing, shelter-in-place, and detection of silent infections to help inform COVID-19 mitigation strategies. METHODS: We extended a previously established agent-based disease transmission model and parameterized it with estimates of COVID-19 characteristics and US population demographics. We implemented non-medical mask-wearing, shelter-in-place, and case isolation as control measures, and quantified their impact on reducing the attack rate and adverse clinical outcomes. RESULTS: We found that non-medical mask-wearing by 75% of the population reduced infections, hospitalizations, and deaths by 37.7% (interquartile range (IQR): 36.1-39.4%), 44.2% (IQR: 42.9-45.8%), and 47.2% (IQR: 45.5-48.7%), respectively, in the absence of a shelter-in-place strategy. Sheltering individuals aged 50 to 64 years of age was the most efficient strategy, decreasing attack rate, hospitalizations, and deaths by over 82% when combined with mask-wearing. Outbreak control was achieved in the simulated scenarios and the attack rate was reduced to below 1% when at least 33% of silent pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections were identified and isolated. CONCLUSIONS: Mask-wearing, even with the use of non-medical masks, has a substantial impact on outbreak control.

The aim of the present study is to characterize an emerging variant pathogenic IBV originating from field outbreaks in vaccinated Egyptian layer flock. Samples were collected from disease-suspected flock with a history of administration of live and inactivated IBV vaccines (Ma5 type). Virus propagation in embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs), after three successive passages, revealed typical IBV lesions such as curling and dwarfism. The reported isolate was identified by a real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay targeting nucleocapsid (N) gene and, further characterized by full-length spike (S1) gene sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis revealed clustering of the isolated virus within 4/91 genotype of GI-13 lineage. Deduced amino acid sequences identity revealed 75–76% and 88–90% similarity with the currently used classic (H120, Ma5, and M41) and variant vaccine strains (4/91 and CR88) in Egypt, respectively. Recombination analysis gave an evidence for distinct patterns of origin for the studied isolate providing another example of intra-genotypic recombination among IBVs and the first example of recombination within the GI-13 lineage in the Egyptian field. The studied isolate (IBV/CK/EG/Fadllah-10/2019) emerged as a result of recombination between the variant group (Egy/var I genotype, GI-23 lineage) as a major parent and the CR88 variant vaccine strain (4/91 genotype, GI-13 lineage) as minor parent. Our data suggest that both mutation and recombination may be contributing to the emergence of IBV variants which ascertain the importance of disease monitoring in vaccinated flocks as well as re-appropriation for the current vaccine strategies.

Incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity suggest a contribution of additional genetic lesions to clinical manifestations and outcome. Some monogenic disorders may therefore actually be digenic. However, only a few digenic disorders have been reported, all discovered by candidate gene approaches applied to at least one locus. We propose here a novel two-locus genome-wide test for detecting digenic inheritance in WES data. This approach uses the gene as the unit of analysis and tests all pairs of genes to detect pairwise gene x gene interactions underlying disease. It is a case-only method, which has several advantages over classic case-control tests, in particular by avoiding recruitment and bias of controls. Our simulation studies based on real WES data identified two major sources of type I error inflation in this case-only test: linkage disequilibrium and population stratification. Both were corrected by specific procedures. Moreover, our case-only approach is more powerful than the corresponding case-control test for detecting digenic interactions in various population stratification scenarios. Finally, we validated our unbiased, genome-wide approach by successfully identifying a previously reported digenic lesion in patients with craniosynostosis. Our case-only test is a powerful and timely tool for detecting digenic inheritance in WES data from patients. Significance statement Despite a growing number of reports of rare disorders not fully explained by monogenic lesions, digenic inheritance has been reported for only 54 diseases to date. The very few existing methods for detecting gene x gene interactions from next-generation sequencing data were generally studied in rare-variant association studies with limited simulation analyses for short genomic regions, under a case-control design. We describe the first case-only approach designed specifically to search for digenic inheritance, which avoids recruitment and bias related to controls. We show, through both extensive simulation studies on real WES datasets and application to a real example of craniosynostosis, that our method is robust and powerful for the genome-wide identification of digenic lesions.",2020-02-07,"Kerner, Gaspard; Bouaziz, Matthieu; Cobat, Aurélie; Bigio, Benedetta; Timberlake, Andrew T; Bustamante, Jacinta; Lifton, Richard P; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Abel, Laurent",bioRxiv,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/99118458280b8f072f70f28c7b0ed19b48052d88.json,,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.06.936922,212409136.0

Evidence suggests that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) ameliorates inflammation in animal models of renal disease, implying that HGF might inhibit specific components of the inflammatory response. This study examined the effect of HGF on endothelial E-selectin expression in acute inflammation induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. In vitro, HGF suppressed TNF-α-induced cell surface expression of E-selectin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and inhibited E-selectin mediated monocytic adhesion to endothelial monolayers. HGF activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)–Akt that in turn inhibited its downstream transducer glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)3. Blockade of the PI3K–Akt pathway with specific inhibitors abrogated HGF induced inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3 and suppression of E-selectin. In addition, selective inhibition of GSK3 activity by lithium suppressed TNF-α-induced E-selectin expression and monocytic adhesion, reminiscent of the action of HGF. Moreover, ectopic expression of an uninhibitable mutant GSK3β, in which the regulatory serine-9 is replaced by alanine, abolished HGF's suppressive effect on endothelial E-selectin. In vivo, administration of exogenous HGF reduced endothelial expression of E-selectin induced by bolus injection of TNF-α. This was associated with less sequestration of circulating fluorescence-labeled macrophages in the kidney. These findings suggest that HGF ameliorates acute renal inflammation in part by downregulating E-selectin mediated macrophage adhesion to the inflamed endothelium.",2006-04-01,"Gong, R.; Rifai, A.; Dworkin, L.D.",Kidney Int,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/68d56c01c685d14f8103aba94c73a6fa88103f73.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7126584.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16501492/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0085253815516505; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0085253815516505,45731393.0

To enter host cells, the viral spike protein (S-protein) binds to its receptor, ACE2, and is then processed by TMPRSS2. Whilst receptor binding contributes to the viral host range, S-protein:ACE2 complexes from other animals have not been investigated widely. To predict infection risks, we modelled S-protein:ACE2 complexes from 215 vertebrate species, calculated changes in the energy of the complex caused by mutations in each species, relative to human ACE2, and correlated these changes with COVID-19 infection data. We also analysed structural interactions to better understand the key residues contributing to affinity. We predict that mutations are more detrimental in ACE2 than TMPRSS2. Finally, we demonstrate phylogenetically that human SARS-CoV-2 strains have been isolated in animals.

Owing to the significant impact on public health and social stability, great attention has been received on the identification of influenza reassortment. METHODS: We proposed a novel computational method named HopPER (Host-prediction-based Probability Estimation of Reassortment), that sturdily estimates reassortment probabilities through host tropism prediction using 147 new features generated from seven physicochemical properties of amino acids. We conducted the experiments on a range of real and synthetic datasets and compared HopPER with several state-of-the-art methods. RESULTS: It is shown that 280 out of 318 candidate reassortants have been successfully identified. Additionally, not only can HopPER be applied to complete genomes but its effectiveness on incomplete genomes is also demonstrated. The analysis of evolutionary success of avian, human and swine viruses generated through reassortment across different years using HopPER further revealed the reassortment history of the influenza viruses.

297662,tqzwu52h,,WHO,Acute Necrotizing Encephalitis as a Probable Association of COVID-19,,,,unk,"Background: Meanwhile, over 50 lakh people have now been affected by coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) across the globe. There are various reports on neurological manifestations of COVID-19, which have attracted broad attention. Acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE) is a rare complication of influenza and other viral infections and has been related to intracranial cytokine storm, which results in breach in blood-brain barrier leading to encephalitis like presentation. We report an unusual case of acute necrotizing encephalitis as a solitary presentation of COVID-19. Case description: We report a case of 35-year-old man from Bihar, presented to our emergency department in unconscious state, with high-grade fever and vomiting since last 5 days. Previous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain showed a left parasellar-middle cranial fossa mass looks most likely like an invasive meningioma. Urgent noncontrast computed tomography scan (NCCT) brain showed that mass as well as hypodensities in both thalami and left caudate nucleus. As per our institutional protocol, clinical management of raised intracranial pressure was initiated. As there is no current evidence from any randomized control trails (RCTs) to recommend any specific treatment for suspected or confirmed patients with COVID-19 with acute necrotizing encephalitis. Conclusion: Our case highlights the importance of identifying encephalitis as a presenting sign of COVID-19 based on NCCT findings with normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and normal chest X-ray (CXR) findings.

Children therefore have the right to education, according to Article 29 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, professional education is not everything, because children must also experience their strengths and weaknesses together and educate each other to be responsible and considerate people, so that they become socially valuable personalities. Only in this way can they shape the future in a peaceful and humane way. Therefore, attending school is essential. However, children also have the right to protection and care by their parents and the state, because the welfare of the child must also be given priority in accordance with Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The question is therefore how schooling in community schools can be realized during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic without exposing children to an unnecessary risk of infection. It is not only about the children, because if the children are at risk, then so are their parents and grandparents and ultimately society as a whole. There are numerous concepts that promise safety in schools during the pandemic. When selecting concepts, the costs must of course be weighed against the benefits. People rightly expect an efficient use of resources. This means that either the set goal is achieved with the least possible resources or that the available resources are used to achieve the greatest possible approximation to the goal. In addition to the financial resources, however, the long-term consequences for the state, the economy, the population and the environment under the pressure of the pandemic must also be taken into account. Social cohesion and democracy must not be jeopardized either. Various protection concepts are currently under discussion. Often the advantages are overstated and the disadvantages concealed. Furthermore, some arguments are based on assumptions that are not true. The aim of this study is to provide a comparative assessment of the main protection concepts and to demonstrate, with the help of experimental analyses, the extent to which the protection concepts are effective. We will show that a comparatively high level of safety against infection in classrooms can be technically ensured without exposing children to masks. At the same time, the protection concept makes economic sense and the burden on the environment is comparatively low, so that infection prevention and climate protection do not have to be weighed against each other, because infection prevention and climate protection are political and social goals that have to be achieved together.",2020-10-14,"KaÌhler, C.

Video streaming uses a data-driven modified mesh architecture which supports dynamic fanout. The whiteboard may be used in synchronization with an active video streaming session. It is shared by both the presenter and the participants in the audience for graphic illustrations during the lecture. P2P-PS provides an important feature called {\em ask doubt} that allows any participant to send a query (or a doubt) during an active presentation session. The query is disseminated to all other peers by preserving the causality between {\em ask doubt} and its resolution. A buffered approach is employed to boost the performance of the whiteboard. The simulations experiments were performed with over 1000 peer nodes on Emulab using 200 physical nodes. The results show that the proposed overlay eventually stabilizes even in the presence of a churning rate of up to 30\%. The maximum path length being just six hops.

The objective of this study is to assess the impact of HBoV viral load on clinical characteristics in children who were HBoV positive and suffered severe LRTI. METHODS: Lower respiratory tract aspirates from 186 hospitalized children with severe LRTI were obtained by bronchoscopy. HBoVs were detected by real-time PCR and other 10 infectious agents were examined using PCR and/or direct fluorescent assay. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (24.6%) were tested positive for HBoV in the respiratory tract aspirates. Fifteen samples had a high viral load (>10(4) copies/mL) and the other sixteen samples had a low viral load (<10(4) copies/mL). The duration of presented wheezing and hospitalization was longer in children with high viral load of HBoV than that in children with low viral load. The days of wheezing showed a correlation with viral load of HBoV. CONCLUSION: We confirmed that HBoV was frequently detected in patients with severe LRTI. Wheezing was one of the most common symptoms presented by patients with positive HBoV. A high HBoV viral load could be an etiologic agent for LRTI, which led to more severe lower respiratory tract symptom, longer duration of wheezing and hospitalization.",2012-03-30,"Deng, Yu; Gu, Xiaoyang; Zhao, Xiaodong; Luo, Jian; Luo, Zhengxiu; Wang, Lijia; Fu, Zhou; Yang, Xiqiang; Liu, Enmei",PLoS One,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ae072e0f04db143d038aa090e714f31e0c8c34bc.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC3316689.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0034353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22479609/,18830961.0

The juxtamembrane domain (JMD) of S is an aromatic amino acid-rich region proximal to the transmembrane domain that is highly conserved in all coronaviruses. Alanine substitutions for one or two of the six aromatic residues in the JMD did not alter the surface expression of the SARS-CoV S proteins with a deletion of the C-terminal 19 amino acids (S Delta19) or reduce binding to soluble human ACE2 (hACE2). However, hACE2-dependent entry of trypsin-treated retrovirus pseudotyped viruses expressing JMD mutant S Delta19 proteins was greatly reduced. Single alanine substitutions for aromatic residues reduced entry to 10 to 60% of the wild-type level. The greatest reduction was caused by residues nearest the transmembrane domain. Four double alanine substitutions reduced entry to 5 to 10% of the wild-type level. Rapid hACE2-dependent S-mediated cell-cell fusion was reduced to 60 to 70% of the wild-type level for all single alanine substitutions and the Y1188A/Y1191A protein. S Delta19 proteins with other double alanine substitutions reduced cell-cell fusion further, from 40% to less than 20% of wild-type levels. The aromatic amino acids in the JMD of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein play critical roles in receptor-dependent virus-cell and cell-cell fusion. Because the JMD is so highly conserved in all coronavirus S proteins, it is a potential target for development of drugs that may inhibit virus entry and/or cell-cell fusion mediated by S proteins of all coronaviruses.",2008,"Howard, Megan W; Travanty, Emily A; Jeffers, Scott A; Smith, M K; Wennier, Sonia T; Thackray, Larissa B; Holmes, Kathryn V",Journal of virology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01805-07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18199653/,22019459.0

METHODS: Thirty-six American head and neck surgical oncology practices responded to questions regarding the triage strategies employed from March to May 2020. RESULTS: Of the programs surveyed, 11 (31%) had official department or hospital-specific guidelines for mitigating care delays and determining which surgical cases could proceed. Seventeen (47%) programs left the decision to proceed with surgery to individual surgeon discretion. Five (14%) programs employed committee review, and 7 (19%) used chairman review systems to grant permission for surgery. Every program surveyed, including multiple in COVID-19 outbreak epicenters, continued to perform complex head and neck cancer resections with free flap reconstruction. CONCLUSIONS: During the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic experience in the United States, head and neck surgical oncology divisions largely eschewed formal triage policies and favored practices that allowed individual surgeons discretion in the decision whether or not to operate.

Through the control over medical education and research it has created a public illusion to prop up corporate profit and encouraged the lust for money and power. An overview of data on cancer and vaccine sciences, the status of Americans' health, a survey of repeated failed projects, economic toxicity, and heavy drug consumption or addiction among young and old provide compelling evidence that in the twentieth century nearly all classic disease categories (congenital, inheritance, neonatal, or induced) shifted to increase induced diseases. Examples of this deceptology in ignoring or minimizing, and mocking fundamental discoveries and theories in cancer and vaccine sciences are attacks on research showing that (a), effective immunity is responsible for defending and killing pathogens and defective cancerous cells, correcting and repairing genetic mutations; (b) viruses cause cancer; and (c), abnormal gene mutations are often the consequences of (and secondary to) disturbances in effective immunity. The outcomes of cancer reductionist approaches to therapies reveal failure rates of 90% (+/‐5) for solid tumors; loss of over 50 million lives and waste of $30‐50 trillions on too many worthless, out‐of‐focus, and irresponsible projects. Current emphasis on vaccination of public with pathogen‐specific vaccines and ingredients seems new terms for drugging young and old. Cumulative exposures to low level carcinogens and environmental hazards or high energy electronic devices (EMF; 5G) are additional triggers to vaccine toxicities (antigen‐mitochondrial overload) or “seeds of immune destruction” that create mini electrical shocks (molecular sinks holes) in highly synchronized and regulated immune network that retard time‐energy‐dependent biorhythms in organs resulting in causes, exacerbations or consequences of mild, moderate or severe immune disorders. Four generations of drug‐dependent Americans strongly suggest that medical establishment has practiced decades of intellectual deception through its claims on “war on cancer”; that cancer is 100, 200, or 1000 diseases; identification of “individual” genetic mutations to cure diseases; “vaccines are safe”. Such immoral and unethical practices, along with intellectual harassment and bullying, censoring or silencing of independent and competent professionals (“Intellectual Me Too”) present grave concerns, far greater compared with the sexual harassment of ‘Me Too’ movement that was recently spearheaded by NIH. The principal driving forces behind conducting deceptive and illogical medical/cancer and vaccine projects seem to be; (a) huge return of investment and corporate profit for selling drugs and vaccines; (b) maintenance of abusive power over public health; (c) global control of population growth via increased induction of diseases, infertility, decline in life‐span, and death. An overview of accidental discoveries that we established and extended since 1980s, on models of acute and chronic ocular inflammatory diseases, provides series of the first evidence for a direct link between inflammation and multistep immune dysfunction in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. Results are relevant to demonstrate that current emphasis on vaccinating the unborn, newborn, or infant would induce immediate or long‐term immune disorders (eg, low birth weight, preterm birth, fatigue, autism, epilepsy/seizures, BBB leakage, autoimmune, neurodegenerative or digestive diseases, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular problems, or cancers). Vaccination of the unborn is likely to disturb trophoblast‐embryo‐fetus‐placenta biology and orderly growth of embryo‐fetus, alter epithelial‐mesenchymal transition or constituent‐inducible receptors, damage mitochondria, and diverse function of histamine‐histidine pathways. Significant increased in childhood illnesses are likely due to toxicities of vaccine and incipient (eg, metals [Al, Hg], detergents, fetal tissue, DNA/RNA) that retard bioenergetics of mitochondria, alter polarization‐depolarization balance of tumoricidal (Yin) and tumorigenic (Yang) properties of immunity. Captivated by complex electobiology of immunity, this multidisciplinary perspective is an attempt to initiate identifying bases for increased induction of immune disorders in three to four generations in America. We hypothesize that (a) gene‐environment‐immune biorhythms parallel neuronal function (brain neuroplasticity) with super‐packages of inducible (adaptive or horizontal) electronic signals and (b) autonomic sympathetic and parasympathetic circuitry that shape immunity (Yin‐Yang) cannot be explained by limited genomics (innate, perpendicular) that conventionally explain certain inherited diseases (eg, sickle cell anemia, progeria). Future studies should focus on deep learning of complex electrobiology of immunity that requires differential bioenergetics from mitochondria and cytoplasm.

At the same time, ACT is necessary for patients with AF, since anticoagulants effectively reduces the risk of ischemic stroke. To make a decision on the appointment of ACT, it is necessary to correlate the risks of ischemic stroke and bleeding, this requires knowledge of current clinical using ACT recommendations and instructions. Among patients admitted to hospital, 30% receive ACT, so increasing adherence to clinical recommendations for prescribing AC to patients with AF by doctors of various profiles is an urgent task. AIM To analyze the adherence of physicians to recommendations for prescribing ACT before and after the introduction of decision support system (DSS) in patients with AF in a multi-specialty hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS A single-center non-randomized study with historical control to assess adherence to recommendations based on the analysis of medical prescriptions and the structure of drug errors in patients with AF in a multi-specialty hospital in Moscow before and after the introduction of DSS. Compliance with the recommendations of physicians was evaluated in the sections indications /contraindications to AC and dosage regimen of AC. The presence of deviations from the clinical recommendations /instructions for medical use of AC was regarded as management of the patient with non-compliance with recommendations. Physicians adherence level to recommendations was calculated as the ratio of cases of compliance with recommendations to the total number of cases. RESULTS In the control and experimental groups, there was a significant increase in the proportion of POAC at discharge in comparison with admission to hospital: from 54.5 to 76.8% (p=0.0005) and from 63 to 85.7% (p=0.0002), respectively. However, only in the experimental group it was possible to significantly reduce the number of patients without a prescribed ACT (if there are indications) from 7.6 to 1% (p=0.04) in comparison with admission. During the study, it was possible to significantly increase physicians adherence level to the recommendations for the AC dosage regimen in patients with AF from 59% (44 discrepancies for 107 prescriptions) to 84.6% (16 discrepancies for 104 prescriptions); p0.005. Before the introduction of the DSS, the analysis of drug prescriptions revealed 56 drug errors (0.5 errors per patient), after the introduction of the DSS, the number of drug errors significantly decreased to 21 (0.2 errors per patient); p0.05. After the introduction of DSS, the number of sub-therapeutic doses of AC was reduced from 31 (27.7%) to 8 (7.6%); p0.05. CONCLUSION The level of adherence to the recommendations for prescribing ACT to patients with AF in the hospital is high. The use of DSS increases the level of adherence to the recommendations on the AC dosage regimen in patients with AF, as well as eliminates errors in calculating the risk of ischemic stroke and systemic thromboembolic complications, and contributes to reducing the frequency of prescribing sub-therapeutic doses of AC.",2020-09-03,"Chernov, A A; Kleymenova, E B; Sychev, D A; Yashina, L P; Nigmatkulova, M D; Otdelenov, V A; Payushchik, S A",Terapevticheskii arkhiv,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.26442/00403660.2020.08.000765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33346460/,222081325.0

Complications may have serious consequences. There is a need for a more reliable, precise, and less traumatic procedure that overcomes the known complications from existing techniques. We analyzed a new epiphysiodesis technique using radio-frequency ablation (RFA) in a porcine model. METHODS Six 35-kg and two 25-kg immature pigs were used. 1 hind leg of each animal was randomly selected and the proximal tibia growth plate was ablated laterally and medially. The contralateral leg was used as a control. MR images were obtained immediately after the ablation and 12 weeks later for 6 animals, and 24 weeks later for the other 2 animals. CT was done for the 2 animals that were followed for 24 weeks for proof of bone bridges. RESULTS Both tibias were equal in length initially. At the 12-week follow-up, there was an average leg length discrepancy of 3.9 mm (95% CI: 3.0-4.8), and at 24 weeks the difference was 8.4 mm and 7.5 mm. No damage to the adjacent tissue was found. Bone bridges and physeal closure were found after 24 weeks. The pigs showed no discomfort after the intervention. INTERPRETATION We found RFA to be feasible for epiphysiodesis in a pig model. The method is minimally invasive and recovery may be quick compared to conventional methods. We recommend that the method should be tested in larger-scale safety studies before clinical application.",2014,"Shiguetomi-Medina, Juan M; Rahbek, Ole; Abood, Ahmed Abdul-Hussein; Stødkilde-Jørgensen, Hans; Møller-Madsen, Bjarne",Acta orthopaedica,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3109/17453674.2014.939014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25036720/,9252715.0

Understanding the factors related to such information sources aids health professionals in educating individuals. OBJECTIVE: This study used data collected from the online survey study on COVID-19 in Taiwan to examine what major COVID-19 information sources are available and which sources are significantly related to the self-confidence of people in coping with COVID-19 in Taiwan. METHODS: A total of 1904 participants (1270 non-health-care workers and 634 health care workers) were recruited from the Facebook advertisement. Their major sources of information about COVID-19, the relationships between the sources and demographic factors, and the relationships between the sources and the self-confidence in coping with COVID-19 were surveyed. RESULTS: Most Taiwanese people relied on the internet for COVID-19 information. Many respondents also used a variety of sources of information on COVID-19; such variety was associated with sex, age, and the level of worry toward COVID-19, as well as if one was a health care worker. For health care workers, the use of formal lessons as an information source was significantly associated with better self-confidence in coping with COVID-19. The significant association between receiving information from more sources and greater self-confidence was found only in health care workers but not in non-health-care workers.

The primary endpoint of this study was overall operation time. Secondary endpoints were preparation time until tumour resection, intraoperative blood loss, number of given units of packed red blood cells, costs of surgery, postoperative morbidity, length of hospital stay and mortality. RESULTS There was no difference in overall operation time between the two groups (P = 0.227). Median costs for pancreatic surgery were significantly less in the conventional group with €3,047 (range 2,004-5,543) vs. €3,527 (range 2,516-5,056, P = 0.009).

The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical manifestations and CT features of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in 15 pregnant women and to provide some initial evidence that can be used for guiding treatment of pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS. We reviewed the clinical data and CT examinations of 15 consecutive pregnant women with COVID-19 pneumonia in our hospital from January 20, 2020, to February 10, 2020. A semiquantitative CT scoring system was used to estimate pulmonary involvement and the time course of changes on chest CT. Symptoms and laboratory results were analyzed, treatment experiences were summarized, and clinical outcomes were tracked. RESULTS. Eleven patients had successful delivery (10 cesarean deliveries and one vaginal delivery) during the study period, and four patients were still pregnant (three in the second trimester and one in the third trimester) at the end of the study period. No cases of neonatal asphyxia, neonatal death, stillbirth, or abortion were reported. The most common early finding on chest CT was ground-glass opacity (GGO). With disease progression, crazy paving pattern and consolidations were seen on CT. The abnormalities showed absorptive changes at the end of the study period for all patients. The most common onset symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia in pregnant women were fever (13/15 patients) and cough (9/15 patients). The most common abnormal laboratory finding was lymphocytopenia (12/15 patients). CT images obtained before and after delivery showed no signs of pneumonia aggravation after delivery. The four patients who were still pregnant at the end of the study period were not treated with antiviral drugs but had achieved good recovery. CONCLUSION. Pregnancy and childbirth did not aggravate the course of symptoms or CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia. All the cases of COVID-19 pneumonia in the pregnant women in our study were the mild type.

HCFMUSP has been converted into a reference center for coronavirus disease 2019. The Division of Plastic Surgery postponed non-essential surgeries and outpatient consultations, accomplishing new guidelines (ANG) of national and international organizations. Even with these challenges arising from the pandemic, alternatives were considered to maintain institutional characteristics. This study aims to analyze this new scenario and the impact on patients’ assistance and Plastic Surgery residents training. METHODS: Total number of surgeries, type of procedures, and outpatient consultations in 2020, before (pre-ANG) and after (post-ANG) ANG, were compared with the same period in 2019 (2019-pre and 2020-post). RESULTS: A marked reduction in the total number of surgeries and outpatient consultations was observed in the post-ANG period. In the post-ANG period, 267 operations were performed (26.7 ± 20.3/week), while in the 2019-post period, 1036 surgeries were performed (103.6 ± 9.7/week) (p = 0.0002). Similarly, 1571 consultations were conducted in the post-ANG period (157.1 ± 93.6/week), while in the 2019-post period, 3907 were performed (390.7 ± 43.1/week) (p = 0.0003). However, in the post-ANG period, an increase in the proportion of reconstructive compared with aesthetic surgery was observed. The maintenance of highly complex procedures such as microsurgical transplants was also identified. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant profile of reconstructive surgeries at the Division of Plastic Surgery allowed the continuity of procedures at all technical complexity levels, patient care maintenance, and Plastic Surgery residents training.

It has been proven that converting large-scale public venues such as stadiums and exhibition centres into Fangcang shelter hospitals, which serve as hospitals for isolation, treatment and disease monitoring of patients with mild symptoms, is the most effective way to control virus transmission and reduce mortality. This paper presents some experiences learnt from treating COVID-19 in Wuhan, the first city to report the outbreak and which suffered from a shortage of emergency supplies, heavy workload among staff and a shortage of hospital beds during the early stages of the pandemic. The experiences include location, accessibility, spacious outdoor area, spacious indoor space, power supply, architectural layout design and partition isolation, ventilation, sewage, and problems in the construction and management of Fangcang shelter hospitals. During the COVID-19 pandemic, traditional approaches to disaster preparedness have demonstrated intrinsic problems, such as poor economic performance, inefficiency and lack of flexibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 0.59- and 2.1-mg FA intravitreal implant in patients with noninfectious posterior uveitis. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, dose-controlled study was performed. Patients were randomized to the 0.59- or 2.1-mg FA implant surgically placed in the vitreous cavity through a pars plana incision and were evaluated at visits through 3 years. Patients with bilateral disease had the more severely affected eye implanted. Outcomes included uveitis recurrence rate, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), use of adjunctive therapy, and safety. RESULTS: A total of 239 patients, predominantly Asian, were implanted (n = 117, 0.59-mg implant; n = 122, 2.1-mg implant). Approximately 80% of patients had bilateral disease. Recurrence rates for implanted eyes decreased from 42.3% during the 1-year pre-implantation period to 25.9% during the 3-year post-implantation period (P = 0.0003) and increased for nonimplanted fellow eyes from 19.8 to 59.7% (P < 0.0001). More implanted eyes gained ≥3 lines of BCVA compared to nonimplanted fellow eyes (P ≤ 0.0046); and implanted eyes required less adjunctive systemic therapy and fewer periocular injections (P < 0.0001). Elevations of intraocular pressure (≥10 mm Hg) were frequent in implanted eyes (67.8%, 0.59-mg implant; 71.3%, 2.1-mg implant); nearly all (94.9%) phakic implanted eyes required cataract surgery. CONCLUSION: The FA intravitreal implant significantly reduced uveitis recurrence rates and led to improvements in visual acuity and reductions in adjunctive therapy. Lens clarity and intraocular pressure require monitoring.

We investigated the transmission of COVID-19 in a cluster of cases. METHODS: We analyzed the epidemiological characteristics of 10 confirmed COVID-19 patients in an outbreak that started at Spa facility A in a local community in Korea on March 28, 2020 and traced them through April 8, 2020. Epidemiological surveys and diagnostic tests were conducted for each contact, and the secondary attack rate was estimated. RESULTS: There were 3 male confirmed patients (30.0%) and 7 female confirmed patients (70.0%), and their mean age was 53.5 years (range, 2.0 to 73.0). Two patients (20.0%) were asymptomatic. The incubation period was between 3 days and 12 days. Three confirmed patients were infected at female's Spa facility A and 7 confirmed patients were second, third, and fourth generations of transmission. Seven confirmed patients contracted COVID-19 through presymptomatic contact. In total, 192 contacts were identified, with a secondary attack rate of 3.6%. Eighty-three contacts (43.2%) were aged 40-59 years, and the secondary attack rate was the highest (12.1%) in those aged &#8805;60 years. Most exposures (n=156, 81.3%) involved casual contact. The number of visitors using the female's spa facility was 58, including 3 confirmed patients, resulting in a secondary outbreak rate of 5.9%.

Activated neutrophils induce inflammation and severe alveolar injury by releasing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). The backbones of many DAMPs and NETs are made of extracellular, cell-free DNA decorated with highly toxic compounds such as elastase, myeloperoxidase and citrullinated histones. Dornase alfa is a FDA-approved recombinant human DNAse 1 for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, which cleaves extracellular DNA and may break up cell-free DNA, loosening sticky mucus in the distal airways and reducing NETs-induced toxicity on alveolar pneumocytes. The COVIDornase trial intends to define the impact of aerosolized intra-tracheal dornase alfa administration on the severity and progression of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 patients. This drug might make lung mucus thinner and looser, promoting improved clearance of secretions and reduce extracellular double-stranded DNA-induced hyperinflammation in alveoli, preventing further damage to the lungs. TRIAL DESIGN: COVIDornase is a prospective, randomized, controlled, 2-arm (1:1 ratio), multicentric, open-label clinical trial. PARTICIPANTS: The study will recruit mechanically ventilated patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) in the recruiting centres (at the time of writing: The Rothschild foundation hospital in Paris, the Strasbourg university hospitals, and Metz-Thionville hospital) who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and meet ARDS criteria. INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Adult patient (age ≥ 18 years old); - Hospitalized in ICU; - With severe COVID-19 pneumonia and ARDS according to Berlin criteria (PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 300 and PEEP > 5 cmH(2)O); - Intubated for less than 8 days; - With an anticipated duration of mechanical ventilation > 48 hours; - Carrier of an arterial catheter; - For whom 4 PaO(2)/FiO(2) values over the preceding 24 hours are available; NON-INCLUSION CRITERIA: - Known hypersensitivity to dornase alfa or any of its excipients; - Pregnant or breastfeeding status; - Patient under legal protection. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Intervention 1, Study group Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme®, Roche, Switzerland) will be administered by aerosol, at a dose of 2500 IU twice daily, 12 hours apart, for 7 consecutive days, using a vibrating mesh nebulizer (Aerogen Solo®, Aerogen, Ireland). The remainder of the management will be performed in accordance with good clinical practice, including mechanical ventilation (protective ventilation, PEEP > 5 cmH(2)O, tracheal balloon pressure check every 4 hours or automatic device, 30° head of the bed elevation, tidal volume 6-8mL/kg, plateau pressure < 30 cmH(2)O), neuromuscular blockers if necessary, prone position if PaO(2)/FiO(2) < 150, early enteral nutrition, glycemic control and a sedation protocol based on the RASS score. Intervention 2, Comparator Patients will receive usual care in accordance with good practice (as detailed above), without aerosols. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is the occurrence of at least one grade improvement between D(0) (inclusion) and D(7) in the ARDS scale severity (Berlin criteria). For instance from “severe” to “moderate” or from “moderate” to “mild”. RANDOMISATION: All consecutive patients meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomised 1:1 using an eCRF-based, computer-generated randomisation table, either to the dornase alfa arm or to the control arm. An interim analysis will be performed after inclusion of 20 patients. Inclusions may be stopped at the interim analysis per data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) advice, if statistical analyses conclude on the futility or efficacy of the intervention or by other DSMB decision. BLINDING (MASKING): The participants and caregivers will not be blinded to study group assignment. Those assessing the outcomes will be blinded to study group assignment.

The cascade is activated by many intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli, which is transduced via adaptor proteins to phosphorylate the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which in turn phosphorylates the inhibitory IκBα protein to undergo proteasomal degradation and sets in motion nuclear events in response to the initial stimulus. Viruses are important modulators of the NF-κB cascade and have evolved multiple mechanisms to activate or inhibit this pathway in a manner conducive to viral multiplication and establishment of a productive infectious cycle. This is a subject of extensive research by multiple laboratories whereby unraveling the interactions between specific viral components and members of the NF-κB signal transduction cascade can shed unique perspectives on infection associated pathogenesis and novel therapeutic targets.

First, ACE2 is the cellular receptor for SARS-COv-2, and expression of the ACE2 gene could regulate the individuals susceptibility to infection. In addition, the balance between ACE1 and ACE activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases and could play a role in the severity of COVID19. Functional ACE1 and ACE2 gene polymorphisms have been associated with the risk of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, and could thus also contribute to the outcome of COVID19. Methods: We studied 204 COVID19 patients (137 non-severe and 67 severe-ICU cases) and 536 age-matched controls. The ACE1 indel and ACE2 rs2285666 polymorphism were determined. Variables frequencies were compared between the groups by logistic regression. We also sequenced the ACE2 coding nucleotides in a group of patients. Results: Severe COVID19 was associated with hypertension male gender (p<0.001), hypertension (p=0.006), hypercholesterolaemia (p=0.046), and the ACE1-DD genotype (p=0.049). In the multiple logistic regression hypertension (p=0.02, OR=2.26, 95CI=1.12-4.63) and male gender (p=0.002; OR=3.15, 95CI=1.56-6.66) remained as independent significant predictors of severity. The ACE2 polymorphism was not associated with the disease outcome. The ACE2 sequencing showed no coding sequence variants that could explain an increased risk of developing COVID19.

Therefore, increasing the pool of senior faculty who wish to become guides and advocates for emerging scientists from HU populations is an essential step toward creating new pathways for their career advancement. As a step toward achieving this goal, we created a novel eight-hour intervention on Culturally Aware Mentoring (CAM), a program of the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN) targeted to faculty and administrators. A previous report of surveys at the end of the CAM sessions revealed substantial awareness and knowledge gains, with participants expressing intentions to use and implement new skills they had learned. In this paper, we provide the results of our thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with academic administrators and faculty, 18-24 months after participation in CAM. Interviews were designed to determine: 1) What changes in self-perceptions and interactions occurred as a result of participation in CAM? 2) What specific components of CAM are associated with changes in individual beliefs and practices? 3) How did participants actively make changes after the CAM workshop? 4) What barriers or challenges do participants encounter after the CAM intervention? The results demonstrate the lasting influences of CAM on participants' awareness of cultural differences, their assumptions about and approaches toward interactions with colleagues and students, and their efforts to change their behaviors to promote inclusive practices in their mentoring and teaching of HU students in STEM. Our findings provide evidence that CAM can be incorporated into existing mentor training programs designed to improve the confidence and capacity of senior research faculty mentors to make culturally-informed, scholar-centered decisions to more deliberately recognize and respond to cultural differences within their mentoring and collegial relationships.",2020,"Womack, Veronica Y; Wood, Christine V; House, Stephanie C; Quinn, Sandra C; Thomas, Stephen B; McGee, Richard; Byars-Winston, Angela",PloS one,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764768/,221074900.0

This systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) aim to provide a comprehensive evaluation of efficacy of available treatments for COVID-19. Methods: We searched for candidate COVID-19 studies in WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database, PubMed, PubMed Central, LitCovid, Proquest Central and Ovid up to December 19, 2020. RCTs for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients were included, regardless of publication status or demographic characteristics. Bayesian NMA with fixed effects was conducted to estimate the effect sizes using posterior means and 95% equal-tailed credible intervals (CrIs), while that with random effects was carried out as well for sensitivity analysis. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to estimate effect sizes of treatments grouped by their drug classifications. Results: We identified 96 eligible RCTs with a total of 51187 patients. Compared with the standard of care (SOC), this NMA showed that dexamethasone led to lower risk of mortality with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.85 (95% CrI [0.76, 0.95]; moderate certainty) and lower risk of mechanical ventilation (MV) with an OR of 0.68 (95% CrI [0.56, 0.83]; low certainty). For hospital discharge, remdesivir (OR 1.37, 95% CrI [1.15, 1.64]; moderate certainty), dexamethasone (OR 1.20, 95% CrI [1.08, 1.34]; low certainty), interferon beta (OR 2.15, 95% CrI [1.26, 3.74]; moderate certainty), tocilizumab (OR 1.40, 95% CrI [1.05, 1.89]; moderate certainty) and baricitinib plus remdesivir (OR 1.75, 95% CrI [1.28, 2.39]; moderate certainty) could all increase the discharge rate respectively. Recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor indicated lower risk of MV (OR 0.20, 95% CrI [0.10, 0.40]; moderate certainty); and patients receiving convalescent plasma resulted in better viral clearance (OR 2.28, 95% CrI [1.57, 3.34]; low certainty). About two-thirds of the studies included in this NMA were rated as high risk of bias, and the certainty of evidence was either low or very low for most of the comparisons.

TRPM8 expression has been found in gut mucosal, submucosal, and muscular nerve endings. Although TRPM8 plays a role in pathological conditions, being involved in visceral pain and inflammation, the physiological functions in the digestive system remain unclear as yet. The aims of the present study were: (i) to verify the TRPM8 expression in human distal colon; (ii) to examine the effects of TRPM8 activation on colonic contractility; (iii) to characterize the mechanism of action. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting were used to analyze TRPM8 expression. The responses of human colon circular strips to different TRPM8 agonists [1-[Dialkyl-phosphinoyl]-alkane (DAPA) 2–5, 1-[Diisopropyl-phosphinoyl]-alkane (DIPA) 1–7, DIPA 1–8, DIPA 1–9, DIPA 1–10, and DIPA 1–12) were recorded using a vertical organ bath. The biomolecular analysis revealed gene and protein expression of TRPM8 in both mucosal and smooth muscle layers. All the agonists tested, except-DIPA 1–12, produced a concentration-dependent decrease in spontaneous contraction amplitude. The effect was significantly antagonized by 5-benzyloxytryptamine, a TRPM8 antagonist. The DIPA 1–8 agonist resulted in the most efficacious and potent activation among the tested molecules. The DIPA 1–8 effects were not affected by tetrodotoxin, a neural blocker, but they were significantly reduced by tetraethylammonium chloride, a non-selective blocker of K(+) channels. Moreover, iberiotoxin, a blocker of the large-conductance Ca(2+)-dependent K(+)-channels, but not apamin, a blocker of small-conductance Ca(2+)-dependent K(+) channels, significantly reduced the inhibitory DIPA 1–8 actions. The results of the present study demonstrated that TRPM8 receptors are also expressed in human distal colon in healthy conditions and that ligand-dependent TRPM8 activation is able to reduce the colonic spontaneous motility, probably by the opening of the large-conductance Ca(2+)-dependent K(+)-channels.",2020-07-29,"Amato, Antonella; Terzo, Simona; Lentini, Laura; Marchesa, Pierenrico; Mulè, Flavia",Int J Mol Sci,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7bffbbdb46519bdc831956f7a5b224b0e638d893.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7432081.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7432081/,

It is highly demanding an intelligent strategy to outline the precaution measures until the clinical trials find a successful vaccine. With technological advancement, Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) has extended its significant role in the development of remote medical point-of-care (RM-PoC). WMSN is generally located on a communication device to sense the vital signaling information that may periodically be transmitted to remote intelligent pouch This modern remote system finds a suitable professional system to inspect the environment condition remotely in order to facilitate the intelligent process. In the past, the RM-PoC has gained more attention for the exploitation of real-time monitoring, treatment follow-up, and action report generation. Even though it has additional advantages in comparison with conventional systems, issues such as security and privacy are seriously considered to protect the modern system information over insecure public networks. Therefore, this study presents a novel Single User Sign-In (SUSI) Mechanism that makes certain of privacy preservation to ensure better protection of multimedia data. It can be achieved over the negotiation of a shared session-key to perform encryption or decryption of sensitive data during the authentication phase. To comply with key agreement properties such as appropriate mutual authentication and secure session key-agreement, a proposed system design is incorporated into the chaotic-map. The above assumption claims that it can not only achieve better security efficiencies but also can moderate the computation, communication, and storage cost of some intelligent systems as compared to elliptic-curve cryptography or RSA. Importantly, in order to offer untraceability and user anonymity, the RM-PoC acquires dynamic identities from proposed SUSI. Moreover, the security efficiencies of proposed SUSI are demonstrated using informal and formal analysis of the real-or-random (RoR) model.

This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the country. The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. AIM: Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures. METHODS: We analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. RESULTS: Of the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Estimates of R(0) varied between 2.50 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18–2.83) in Tuscany and 3.00 (95% CI: 2.68–3.33) in Lazio. The net reproduction number R(t) in northern regions started decreasing immediately after the first detection. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy showed a clustering onset similar to the one in Wuhan, China. R(0) at 2.96 in Lombardy combined with delayed detection explains the high case load and rapid geographical spread. Overall, R(t) in Italian regions showed early signs of decrease, with large diversity in incidence, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.",2020-12-10,"Riccardo, Flavia; Ajelli, Marco; Andrianou, Xanthi D; Bella, Antonino; Del Manso, Martina; Fabiani, Massimo; Bellino, Stefania; Boros, Stefano; Urdiales, Alberto Mateo; Marziano, Valentina; Rota, Maria Cristina; Filia, Antonietta; D'Ancona, Fortunato; Siddu, Andrea; Punzo, Ornella; Trentini, Filippo; Guzzetta, Giorgio; Poletti, Piero; Stefanelli, Paola; Castrucci, Maria Rita; Ciervo, Alessandra; Di Benedetto, Corrado; Tallon, Marco; Piccioli, Andrea; Brusaferro, Silvio; Rezza, Giovanni; Merler, Stefano; Pezzotti, Patrizio; di Martino, Angela; Facchini, Marzia; Giannitelli, Stefania; Mancini, Fabiola; Puzelli, Simona; Urciuoli, Roberta; Petrucci, Antonia; Labianca, Michele; Mignuoli, Anna Domenica; D'Argenzio, Angelo; Massimiliani, Erika; Gallo, Tolinda; Scognamiglio, Paola; Sticchi, Camilla; Cereda, Danilo; Fiacchini, Daniel; Sforza, Francesco; Zuccaro, Maria Grazia; Benetollo, Pier Paolo; Tiberti, Donatella; Chironna, Maria; Palmas, Maria Antonietta; Scondotto, Salvatore; Balocchini, Emanuela; Tosti, Anna; Ruffier, Mauro; Da Re, Filippo",Euro Surveill,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/3899c7ec97761564f7ff8963d312567dd967a107.json; document_parses/pdf_json/24bde6bac42961489960dfdeefbc0016c84452f6.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7730489.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33303064/; https://doi.org/10.2807/1560-7917.es.2020.25.49.2000790,228096564.0

Although these viruses share many similarities, important differences with regard to pathogenicity, type of immune response, and molecular mechanisms during virus infection are different between and within New World and Old World viral infections. Viruses rely exclusively on the host cellular machinery to translate their genome, and therefore to replicate and propagate. miRNAs are the crucial factor in diverse biological processes such as antiviral defense, oncogenesis, and cell development. The viral infection can exert a profound impact on the cellular miRNA expression profile, and numerous RNA viruses have been reported to interact directly with cellular miRNAs and/or to use these miRNAs to augment their replication potential. Our present study indicates that mammarenavirus infection induces metabolic reprogramming of host cells, probably manipulating cellular microRNAs. A number of metabolic pathways, including valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis, d-Glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism, thiamine metabolism, and pools of several amino acids were impacted by the predicted miRNAs that would no longer regulate these pathways. A deeper understanding of mechanisms by which mammarenaviruses handle these signaling pathways is critical for understanding the virus/host interactions and potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets, through the inhibition of specific pathologic metabolic pathways.",2020-11-23,"Fernandes, Jorlan; Miranda, Renan Lyra; de Lemos, Elba Regina Sampaio; Guterres, Alexandro",Cells,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/ad5207bd9a9baf1cd1b8bfdd599e57839ca5c92b.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7709035.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7709035/,

Due to its high economic toll and its impact on personal freedom, we need to ease social distancing and deploy alternative measures, while preventing further waves of infections. While reliable mass testing (for virus RNA) would require too many resources to be effective, CT, which focuses on isolating symptomatic cases and their contacts, has been implemented in many countries. However, the latter approach has reduced efficiency when high numbers of positive patients are burdening the tracing centers. Moreover, CT misses transmissions by asymptomatic cases. Therefore, its effect in reducing the reproduction number has a theoretical limit. To improve effectiveness of contact tracing, we propose to complement it with a strategy relying on identifying and testing symptom free subgroups with a significantly higher than average virus prevalence. We call this smart testing (ST). By testing everybody in these subgroups, in addition to symptomatic cases, also large fractions of pre- and asymptomatic persons can be identified, which enhances the effectiveness of contact tracing. High prevalence subgroups can be found in different ways, which are discussed in this paper. A particularly efficient way is via preselection using cheap and fast virus antigen tests, as proposed recently. Mathematical modeling quantifies the potential reduction of the reproduction number by such a two-stage ST strategy. In addition to global scenarios, also more realistic local applications of two-stage ST have been investigated, that is, within counties, institutions, schools, companies, etc., where members have internal as well as external contacts. All involved model parameters have been varied within realistic ranges and results are presented with probabilities. Even with the most pessimistic parameter set, these results suggest that the effect of two-stage ST on the reproduction number would clearly outweigh its economic cost. Two-stage ST is technically and logistically feasible. Further, it is locally effective also when only applied within small local subpopulations. Thereby, two-stage ST efficiently complements the portfolio of mitigation strategies, which allow easing social distancing without compromising public health.",2020-12-02,"Gorji, H.; Arnoldini, M.; Jenny, D.

As polysaccharides may also have anti-inflammatory functions, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects and related molecular mechanisms of a crude polysaccharide (HMFO) obtained from HMF of CW in mice with dextran sulfate sodium- (DSS-) induced colitis and in lipopolysaccharide-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages. HMFO ameliorated the pathological characteristics of colitis and significantly reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines in the serum. Histological analysis indicated that HMFO improved the signs of histological damage such as abnormal crypts, crypt loss, and inflammatory cell infiltration induced by DSS. In addition, HMFO inhibited iNOS and COX-2 protein expression, as well as phosphorylated NF-κB p65 levels in the colon tissue of mice with DSS-induced colitis. In macrophages, HMFO inhibited several cytokines and enzymes involved in inflammation such as prostaglandin E(2), nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2 by attenuating nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases.

BACKGROUND: In the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults are more likely to be infected and develop serious outcomes than young people. Worldwide, senior-living facilities face a battle to protect their residents. Compared with age-related declines, the built environment is more modifiable and can be used for infection control. METHODS: This research conducted content analysis of the guidelines on COVID-19 control issued by the State Council of China in February 2020 for senior-living facilities. Six senior-living facility managers in China were interviewed and shared their experiences using these guidelines. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted to identify the essential environmental factors for infection control. RESULTS: Environmental factors suggested in the guidelines were analyzed for three groups of infection-control strategies: keep COVID-19 from entering the facility, prevent COVID-19 spread in the facility, and manage infection and illness. Key topics of experience using the guidelines were identified, including residents’ needs for social interaction and the difficulties of providing dedicated air-conditioning and circulation systems.

Using comprehensive administrative data from Germany, we analysed the nationwide development of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and MT in Germany between 2010 and 2016. Methods We considered all documented cases (n = 1,515,634) with a main diagnosis of the ICD-10-GM code I63 (ischemic stroke) and identified specific stroke recanalization therapy by using the corresponding Operating and Procedure Key for systemic thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy out of the DRG statistics. Regional analyses are based on data from the 413 German administrative districts and cities and the obligatory quality reports of all hospitals. We distinguished between rates of MT related to place of residence of patients and place of treatment. Results Coded ischemic strokes increased by 10.2% from 2010 (n = 206.688) to 2016 (n = 227.687). The rate of IVT increased from 8.9% in 2010 to 14.9% in 2016 and the rate of MT increased from 0.8% in 2010 to 4.7% in 2016 with a strong increase in 2015 and 2016. There was a high regional variability of MT according to place of residence of patients between 0 and 11.2% in 2016 with significant lower treatment rates in rural compared to urban areas (3.8 vs 5.4%). Mean age of patients treated with MT increased from 67.8 years in 2010 to 73.3 years in 2016 and almost reached the mean age of IVT treated patients (74.4 years). The number of hospitals coding MT increased from 91 to 193 from 2010 to 2016, but 80% of all MT procedures were performed in neurointerventional centers with ≥50 procedures/year in 2016. Conclusions The rate of IVT in patients with acute ischemic stroke in Germany continues to rise and has reached 14.9% nationwide. The increase of MT is even more pronounced and was triggered by the evidence after publication of the MT randomized trials.

In addition, people’s outdoor activities have been limited, making it more difficult to find outlets for releasing stress. Under this situation, some people began to experience emotions of anxiety and depression. This article reports a case of depression with fever caused by the stress tension of the pandemic. The patient was highly suspected to have contracted COVID-19. The reported patient, who had a history of depression and had been to Wuhan to attend an exam, showed obvious pre-exam anxiety under the epidemic situation, which gradually increased the patient's pressure and then caused some adverse symptoms, such as insomnia, anxiety, sweating and a reoccurrent fever. Local community authorities paid close attention to him and later sent him to a general hospital in Jingmen for quarantine and treatment, as he was suspected of having COVID-19. After being hospitalised for half a month, he was ruled out from having ‘COVID-19’ and was cured of depression and discharged from the hospital.

Here we examined the contribution of ERK1/2 in early steps of JUNV and TCRV multiplication. JUNV adsorption, internalization, and uncoating were not affected by treatment of cultured cells with U0126, an inhibitor of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. In contrast, U0126 caused a marked reduction in viral protein expression and RNA synthesis, while JUNV RNA synthesis was significantly augmented in the presence of an activator of the ERK1/2 pathway. Moreover, U0126 impaired the expression of a reporter gene in a TCRV-based replicon system, confirming the ability of the compound to hinder arenavirus macromolecular synthesis. By using a cell-based assay, we determined that the inhibitor did not affect the translation of a synthetic TCRV-like mRNA. No changes in the phosphorylation pattern of the translation factor eIF2α were found in U0126-treated cells. Our results indicate that U0126 impairs viral RNA synthesis, thereby leading to a subsequent reduction in viral protein expression. Thus, we conclude that ERK1/2 signaling activation is required for an efficient arenavirus RNA synthesis.",2018-04-17,"Brunetti, Jesús E.; Foscaldi, Sabrina; Quintana, Verónica M.; Scolaro, Luis A.; López, Nora; Castilla, Viviana",Viruses,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/c5c2bc7a07670d6fb970d84a59aab3832752a3f1.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC5923493.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5923493/,

The analysis investigates the impact globalization has on the speed of initial transmission to a country and on the scale of initial infections in the context of other driving factors. Our cross-country analysis finds that measures of globalization are positively related to the spread of the virus, both in speed and scale.

A total of 1552 respondents were recruited in the study by random selection from the telephone book. Demographic data, SARS experience, self-perceived health state, neighborhood relationships, and depression were surveyed by telephone interviewing. Respondents were grouped as 'impacted group' and 'non-impacted group' according to whether they or their friends and family had been quarantined, or suspected of being infected. The psychosocial impact and associated factors were compared between the two groups. The 'impacted group' had higher depressive levels, poorer neighborhood relationships, poorer self-perceived health, and a higher economic impact than the 'non-impacted group'. The poorer self-perceived health and economic impact factors were associated with depression. The neighborhood relationship factor was negatively associated with depression for the 'impacted group', but not for the 'non-impacted group'. The 'impacted group' had experienced greater psychosocial impact possibly due to the SARS impact, the economic downturn, poor self-perceived health conditions, and decreased social support systems.

While much research relies upon viruses grown in cultured immortalized cells, human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV-3) evolves in culture. Cultured viruses differ in their properties compared to clinical strains. We present a genome-wide survey of HPIV-3 adaptations to culture using metagenomic next-generation sequencing of matched pairs of clinical samples and primary culture isolates (zero passage virus). Nonsynonymous changes arose during primary viral isolation, almost entirely in the genes encoding the two surface glycoproteins—the receptor binding protein hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) or the fusion protein (F). We recovered genomes from 95 HPIV-3 primary culture isolates and 23 HPIV-3 strains directly from clinical samples. HN mutations arising during primary viral isolation resulted in substitutions at HN’s dimerization/F-interaction site, a site critical for activation of viral fusion. Alterations in HN dimer interface residues known to favor infection in culture occurred within 4 days (H552 and N556). A novel cluster of residues at a different face of the HN dimer interface emerged (P241 and R242) and imply a role in HPIV-3-mediated fusion. Functional characterization of these culture-associated HN mutations in a clinical isolate background revealed acquisition of the fusogenic phenotype associated with cultured HPIV-3; the HN-F complex showed enhanced fusion and decreased receptor-cleaving activity. These results utilize a method for identifying genome-wide changes associated with brief adaptation to culture to highlight the notion that even brief exposure to immortalized cells may affect key viral properties and underscore the balance of features of the HN-F complex required for fitness by circulating viruses.",2018-07-03,"Iketani, Sho; Shean, Ryan C.; Ferren, Marion; Makhsous, Negar; Aquino, Dolly B.; des Georges, Amedee; Rima, Bert; Mathieu, Cyrille; Porotto, Matteo; Moscona, Anne; Greninger, Alexander L.",mBio,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7f8715a818bfd325bf4413d3c07003d7ce7b6f7e.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC6030562.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6030562/,

As one of the 'hotspots' in the UK , the surgical branch of trauma and orthopaedics need strategies to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of COVID-19. Methods: Adapting to the crisis locally involved five operational elements: 1) triaging and workflow of orthopaedic patients; 2) operation theatre feasibility and functioning; 3) conservation of human resources and management of workforce in the department; 4) speciality training and progression; and 5) developing an exit strategy to resume elective work. Two hospitals under our trust were redesignated based on the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Registrar/consultant led telehealth reviews were carried out for early postoperative patients. Workflows for the management of outpatient care and inpatient care were created. We looked into the development of a dedicated operating space to perform the emergency orthopaedic surgeries without symptoms of COVID-19.

In this study, we utilize the combination of powerful bioinformatic prediction algorithms and miRNA profiling to predict endogenous host miRNAs that may play important roles in regulating SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. We provide a collection of high-probability miRNA binding sites within the SARS-CoV-2 genome as well as within mRNA transcripts of critical viral entry proteins ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and their upstream modulators, the interferons (IFN). By utilizing miRNA profiling datasets of SARS-CoV-2-resistant and -susceptible cell lines, we verify the biological plausibility of the predicted miRNA-target RNA interactions. Finally, we utilize miRNA profiling of SARS-CoV-2-infected cells to identify predicted miRNAs that are differentially regulated in infected cells. In particular, we identify predicted miRNA binders to SARS-CoV-2 ORFs (miR-23a (1ab), miR-29a, -29c (1ab, N), miR-151a, -151b (S), miR-4707-3p (S), miR-298 (5'-UTR), miR-7851-3p (5'-UTR), miR-8075 (5'-UTR)), ACE2 3'-UTR (miR-9-5p, miR-218-5p), TMPRSS2 3'-UTR (let-7d-5p, -7e-5p, miR-494-3p, miR-382-3p, miR-181c-5p), and IFN-&#945; 3'-UTR (miR-361-5p, miR-410-3p). Overall, this study provides insight into potential novel regulatory mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 by host miRNAs and lays the foundation for future investigation of these miRNAs as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers.",2020,"Pierce, Jacob B; Simion, Viorel; Icli, Basak; Pérez-Cremades, Daniel; Cheng, Henry S; Feinberg, Mark W",,,#927185,,,,,227065750.0
120402,23m8w6nl,,Medline,Distinct lipid/lipoprotein profiles and hormonal responsiveness in nine ethnic groups of postmenopausal Asian women: the Pan-Asia Menopause (PAM) study.,,,17487649.0,unk,"BACKGROUND Lipid/lipoprotein profiles, among other factors, are associated with risk of cardiovascular disease. Because cardiovascular disease varies in Asian countries, we hypothesized that lipid profiles differ in ethnic groups of postmenopausal Asian women. To add to the limited body of information currently available, we also investigated the effects of estrogen/progestin therapy on lipid/lipoprotein profiles in postmenopausal Asian women. METHODS The Pan-Asia Menopause (PAM) study was a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial evaluating 1028 postmenopausal women at 22 investigational centers in 11 Asian countries/territories. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three doses of continuous combined conjugated estrogens (CE)/medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA): CE/MPA (in mg/day) = 0.625/2.5, 0.45/1.5 or 0.3/1.5. The treatment period, following baseline evaluations, consisted of six continuous 28-day cycles. Analysis of lipid profiles was a secondary objective of the PAM study. Total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), very low density cholesterol (VLDC-C), triglycerides and lipoprotein(a) were analyzed at a central laboratory by state-of-the-art methods. RESULTS Mean concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL-C, VLDL-C and triglycerides differed significantly among the nine ethnic groups of postmenopausal women. This difference was independent of body mass index and age, two factors that also influenced lipid/lipoprotein profiles. Mean HDL-C concentrations also differed, but this difference was influenced by body mass index in a weak interaction. All three doses of CE/MPA significantly lowered total cholesterol. Treatment with the high and middle doses significantly lowered LDL-C, and increased HDL-C, VLDL-C and triglycerides. The high dose produced a significant decrease in lipoprotein(a). CONCLUSIONS The different lipid/lipoprotein profiles in the nine ethnic groups of postmenopausal Asian women evaluated here suggest a relationship to differences in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease reported for different regions in Asia. However, the reported prevalence data on cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in the regions corresponding to the nine ethnic groups are insufficient to allow qualitative comparisons with the lipid profiles shown in our study. The lipid/lipoprotein changes in response to estrogen/progestin therapy observed here are consistent with those reported for Western women.",2007,"Taechakraichana, N; Holinka, C F; Haines, C J; Subramaniam, R; Tian, X W; Ausmanas, M K",Climacteric : the journal of the International Menopause Society,,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17487649/,22692625.0

All infected patients underwent olfactory function assessment and 3T MRI, performed both at the early stage of the disease and at one-month follow-up. RESULTS At the early stage, SARS-CoV2-infected patients had a mean olfactory score of 2.8 +/- 2.7 (range 0-8), and MRI displayed a complete obstruction of the OC in 19 out of 20 patients. Controls had normal olfactory scores and no obstruction of the OC on MRI. At one month follow-up, the olfactory score had improved to 8.3 +/- 1.9 (range 4-10) in patients, and only 7 out of 20 patients still had an obstruction of the OC.

Intense research efforts are now focusing on defining viral characteristics that confer a growth advantage, pathogenicity, or cell adaptability in order to better understand the PEDV life cycle and identify suitable targets for antiviral or vaccine development. Here, we report a unique phenomenon of PEDV nucleocapsid (N) cleavage by the PEDV-encoded 3C-like protease (3Cpro) during infection. The identification of the 3Cpro cleavage site at the C terminus of N supported previous observations that PEDV 3Cpro showed a substrate requirement slightly different from that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3Cpro and revealed a greater flexibility in its substrate recognition site. This cleavage motif is present in the majority of cell culture-adapted PEDV strains but is missing in emerging field isolates. Remarkably, reverse-genetics-derived cell culture-adapted PEDVAVCT12 harboring uncleavable N displayed growth retardation in Vero E6-APN cells compared to the wild-type virus. These observations altogether shed new light on the investigation and characterization of the PEDV nucleocapsid protein and its possible link to cell culture adaptation. IMPORTANCE Recurrent PEDV outbreaks have resulted in enormous economic losses to swine industries worldwide. To gain the upper hand in combating this disease, it is necessary to understand how this virus replicates and evades host immunity. Characterization of viral proteins provides important clues to mechanisms by which viruses survive and spread. Here, we characterized an intriguing phenomenon in which the nucleocapsids of some PEDV strains are proteolytically processed by the virally encoded main protease. Growth retardation in recombinant PEDV carrying uncleavable N suggests a replication advantage provided by the cleavage event, at least in the cell culture system. These findings may direct us to a more complete understanding of PEDV replication and pathogenicity.",2017,"Jaru-Ampornpan, Peera; Jengarn, Juggragarn; Wanitchang, Asawin; Jongkaewwattana, Anan",Journal of virology,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01660-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27807240/,26388911.0

DESIGN This study was a retrospective chart review of 16 patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 under 3 yrs of age consecutively referred for respiratory decompensations resulting in continuous NIV dependence and oxyhemoglobin desaturation. An avoided hospitalization was defined by the need for continuous NIV using high span bilevel positive airway pressure and reversal of desaturations by MAC in the home setting. The protocol included training and equipping parents to use NIV, MAC, and basic life support. RESULTS There were 49 acute episodes (1.20/patient per year), of which 43 met the criteria for an avoided hospitalization. Therefore, only six episodes (0.15/patient per year) required hospitalization, and four required endotracheal intubation (0.1/patient per year). Three of the four were extubated after 4, 9, and 15 days, respectively, to full NIV support and aggressive MAC. The fourth patient, for whom NIV could not be provided, underwent an emergency intubation at home and died at the age of 40 mos.

It has been reported in ocular infections including those of patients using contact lenses. Treatment is difficult because Acinetobacter is frequently multidrug resistant. Antibiotic-resistant strains frequently also harbor genes for antiseptic resistance (quaternary ammonium compound [QAC]) genes. Because Acinetobacter is part of the normal flora, it may contaminate contact lens and accessories. This study aims to investigate carriage rates of QAC genes in household and clinical isolates of Acinetobacter and to determine the effectiveness of two multipurpose solutions (MPSs) for soft lenses against organisms carrying QAC genes. METHODS DNA was extracted from 11 bathroom isolates and 15 clinical isolates and amplified by polymerase chain reaction to determine the presence of qacEΔ1. Gene-positive and gene-negative control strains were used to challenge the two MPSs, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of these organisms to benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate were determined. RESULTS More than 90% of isolates carried qacEΔ1. The MICs of clinical isolates were higher than those of isolates of bathrooms. Both MPSs were able to produce a 3-log reduction in the numbers of all isolates. CONCLUSIONS Although most isolates carried qacEΔ1 and elevated MICs to benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate were observed, all were susceptible to both MPSs tested. However, if there were to be poor compliance with care procedures, it is probable that such organisms could survive in the presence of diluted or expired solutions.",2014,"Boost, Maureen V; Chan, Jessica; Shi, Guang-sen; Cho, Pauline",Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1097/opx.0000000000000177; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509546/,42398975.0

There has been inadequate attention to the delivery of behavioural interventions to younger children (5-11 years old). Objective Our objectives were to describe the characteristics of behavioural interventions for children aged 5-11 years. Data sources We searched five databases: CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library, from January 2005 to August 2019. Study selection The inclusion criteria were (1) children aged 5-11, (2) cognitive and/or behavioural interventions, (3) randomised controlled trials and (4) 2005 onward. Two researchers independently identified studies for inclusion. Data extraction Two researchers independently extracted data from eligible papers. Results The search identified 10 541 papers. We extracted information on 117 interventions (from 152 papers). Many of the interventions were categorised as complex. This was particularly true for clinical populations; 78.7% were delivered to both the child and parent, and 33.9% took place across multiple settings, typically health and school settings. Most (70.9%) were 'First Wave' (behavioural) interventions, and few (4.3%) were 'Third Wave' (characterised by metacognition, acceptance and mindfulness). Thirty-nine per cent used interactive techniques (play, arts, story and/or games). Purely digital and paper-based interventions were rare, but around a third used these tools as supplements to face-face delivery. There were differences in interventions for younger (5-7 years) and older (8-11 years) children. Conclusions Interventions designed and delivered to children should be developmentally sensitive.

The aim of the present study was to identify the predictors of postoperative mortality after emergent open colectomy for IC treatment. Additionally, we compared postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing emergent colectomy due to aortic surgery-related IC (AS-IC group) vs. other IC etiologies (Other-IC group). METHODS: We analyzed records of consecutive patients who underwent emergency open colectomy for IC between 2008 and 2019. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify clinical and operative parameters associated with postoperative mortality. The AS-IC and Other-IC groups were compared for mortality, morbidity, ICU stay, hospital stay, and survival. RESULTS: During the study period, 94 patients (mean age, 67.4 ± 13.7 years) underwent emergent open colectomy for IC. In the majority of cases, IC involved the entire colon (53.2%) and vasopressor agents were required preoperatively (63.8%) and/or intraoperatively (78.8%). Thirty-four patients underwent surgery due to AS-IC, whereas 60 due to Other-IC causes. In the AS-IC group, 9 patients had undergone endovascular aortic repair and 25 open aortic surgery; 61.8% of patients needed aortic surgery for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurism (AAA). Overall, 66 patients (70.2%) died within 90 days from surgery. The AS-IC and Other-IC groups showed similar operative outcomes and postoperative complication rates. However, the duration of the ICU stay (19 days vs. 11 days; p = 0.003) and of the total hospital stay (22 days vs. 16 days; p = 0.016) was significantly longer for the AS-IC group than for the Other-IC group. The rate of intestinal continuity restoration at 1 year after surgery was higher for the Other-IC group than for the AS-IC group (58.8% vs. 22.2%; p = 0.05). In the multivariate model, preoperative increased lactate levels, a delay between signs/symptoms' onset and surgery > 12 h, and the occurrence of postoperative acute kidney injury were statistically associated with postoperative mortality. Neither IC etiology (aortic surgery vs. other etiology) nor ruptured AAA was associated with postoperative mortality. CONCLUSION: Emergency open colectomy for IC is associated with high postoperative mortality, which appears to be unrelated to the IC etiology.

PURPOSE: To develop an artificial intelligence algorithm to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other causes of abnormalities at chest radiography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, a deep neural network, CV19-Net, was trained, validated, and tested on chest radiographs in patients with and without COVID-19 pneumonia. For the chest radiographs positive for COVID-19, patients with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction results positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with findings positive for pneumonia between February 1, 2020, and May 30, 2020, were included. For the non–COVID-19 chest radiographs, patients with pneumonia who underwent chest radiography between October 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019, were included. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to characterize diagnostic performance. To benchmark the performance of CV19-Net, a randomly sampled test data set composed of 500 chest radiographs in 500 patients was evaluated by the CV19-Net and three experienced thoracic radiologists. RESULTS: A total of 2060 patients (5806 chest radiographs; mean age, 62 years ± 16 [standard deviation]; 1059 men) with COVID-19 pneumonia and 3148 patients (5300 chest radiographs; mean age, 64 years ± 18; 1578 men) with non–COVID-19 pneumonia were included and split into training and validation and test data sets. For the test set, CV19-Net achieved an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.93). This corresponded to a sensitivity of 88% (95% CI: 87, 89) and a specificity of 79% (95% CI: 77, 80) by using a high-sensitivity operating threshold, or a sensitivity of 78% (95% CI: 77, 79) and a specificity of 89% (95% CI: 88, 90) by using a high-specificity operating threshold.

We aimed to investigate viral interference between rhinovirus and IAV with use of clinical data and an experimental model. Methods We did a clinical data analysis and experimental infection study to investigate the co-occurrence of rhinovirus and IAV in respiratory specimens from adults (≥21 years) tested with a multiplex PCR panel at Yale-New Haven Hospital (CT, USA) over three consecutive winter seasons (Nov 1 to March 1, 2016-17, 2017-18, and 2018-19). We compared observed versus expected co-detections using data extracted from the Epic Systems electronic medical record system. To assess how rhinovirus infection affects subsequent IAV infection, we inoculated differentiated primary human airway epithelial cultures with rhinovirus (HRV-01A; multiplicity of infection [MOI] 0·1) or did mock infection. On day 3 post-infection, we inoculated the same cultures with IAV (H1N1 green fluorescent protein [GFP] reporter virus or H1N1pdm09; MOI 0·1). We used reverse transcription quantitative PCR or microscopy to quantify host cell mRNAs for interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) on day 3 after rhinovirus or mock infection and IAV RNA on days 4, 5, or 6 after rhinovirus or mock infection. We also did sequential infection studies in the presence of BX795 (6 μM), to inhibit the interferon response. We compared ISG expression and IAV RNA and expression of GFP by IAV reporter virus. Findings Between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2019, examination of 8284 respiratory samples positive for either rhinovirus (n=3821) or IAV (n=4463) by any test method was used to establish Nov 1 to March 1 as the period of peak virus co-circulation. After filtering for samples within this time frame meeting the inclusion criteria (n=13 707), there were 989 (7·2%) rhinovirus and 922 (6·7%) IAV detections, with a significantly lower than expected odds of co-detection (odds ratio 0·16, 95% CI 0·09-0·28). Rhinovirus infection of cell cultures induced ISG expression and protected against IAV infection 3 days later, resulting in an approximate 50 000-fold decrease in IAV H1N1pdm09 viral RNA on day 5 post-rhinovirus inoculation. Blocking the interferon response restored IAV replication following rhinovirus infection. Interpretation These findings show that one respiratory virus can block infection with another through stimulation of antiviral defences in the airway mucosa, supporting the idea that interference from rhinovirus disrupted the 2009 IAV pandemic in Europe. These results indicate that viral interference can potentially affect the course of an epidemic, and this possibility should be considered when designing interventions for seasonal influenza epidemics and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

Bacterial-induced host proteins such as procalcitonin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and Interleukin-6, are routinely used to support diagnosis of infection. However, their performance is negatively affected by inter-patient variability, including time from symptom onset, clinical syndrome, and pathogens. Our aim was to identify novel viral-induced host proteins that can complement bacterial-induced proteins to increase diagnostic accuracy. Initially, we conducted a bioinformatic screen to identify putative circulating host immune response proteins. The resulting 600 candidates were then quantitatively screened for diagnostic potential using blood samples from 1002 prospectively recruited patients with suspected acute infectious disease and controls with no apparent infection. For each patient, three independent physicians assigned a diagnosis based on comprehensive clinical and laboratory investigation including PCR for 21 pathogens yielding 319 bacterial, 334 viral, 112 control and 98 indeterminate diagnoses; 139 patients were excluded based on predetermined criteria. The best performing host-protein was TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (area under the curve [AUC] of 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.86 to 0.91), which was consistently up-regulated in viral infected patients. We further developed a multi-protein signature using logistic-regression on half of the patients and validated it on the remaining half. The signature with the highest precision included both viral- and bacterial-induced proteins: TRAIL, Interferon gamma-induced protein-10, and CRP (AUC of 0.94; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.96). The signature was superior to any of the individual proteins (P<0.001), as well as routinely used clinical parameters and their combinations (P<0.001).

To determine the significance of the SARS-CoV group-specific ORFs in virus replication in vitro and in mice, we systematically deleted five of the eight group-specific ORFs, ORF3a, OF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF7b, and characterized recombinant virus replication and gene expression in vitro. Deletion of the group-specific ORFs of SARS-CoV, either alone or in various combinations, did not dramatically influence replication efficiency in cell culture or in the levels of viral RNA synthesis. The greatest reduction in virus growth was noted following ORF3a deletion. SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein does not encode a rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER)/Golgi retention signal, and it has been suggested that ORF3a interacts with and targets S glycoprotein retention in the rER/Golgi apparatus. Deletion of ORF3a did not alter subcellular localization of the S glycoprotein from distinct punctuate localization in the rER/Golgi apparatus. These data suggest that ORF3a plays little role in the targeting of S localization in the rER/Golgi apparatus. In addition, insertion of the 29-bp deletion fusing ORF8a/b into the single ORF8, noted in early-stage SARS-CoV human and civet cat isolates, had little if any impact on in vitro growth or RNA synthesis.

METHODS Through a micro-costing approach, the thyroidectomy patient-care process (with and without IONM) was analyzed by considering direct costs (staff time, consumables, equipment, drugs, operating room, and general expenses). Unit costs were collected from hospital accounting and standard tariff lists. To assess the impact of the IONM technology on hospital management, three macro-scenarios were considered: (1) traditional thyroidectomy; (2) thyroidectomy with IONM in a high-volume setting (5 procedures per week); and (3) thyroidectomy with IONM in a low-volume setting (1 procedure per week). Energy-based devices (EBD) for hemostasis and dissection in thyroidectomy were also evaluated, as well as the reimbursement made by the Italian Healthcare System on the basis of diagnosis related groups (DRGs), about €2,600. RESULTS Comparison between costs and the DRG fee shows an underfunding of total hospitalization costs for all thyroidectomies, regardless of IONM use (scenario 1: €3,471). The main cost drivers are consumables and technologies (25%), operating room (16%), and staff (14%). Hospitalization costs for a thyroidectomy with IONM range from €3,713 to €3,770 (scenarios 2 and 3), 5–7% higher than those for traditional thyroidectomy. Major economic differences emerge when an EBD is used (€3,969). CONCLUSIONS The regional DRG tariff for thyroid surgery is barely sufficient to cover conventional surgery costs.

This article will provide a critical response to Mila's COVI White Paper. Specifically, this article will discuss: the extent to which diversity has been considered in the design of the app, assumptions surrounding users' interaction with the app and the app's utility, as well as unanswered questions surrounding transparency, accountability, and security.

The C allele of the rs12252 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) shows vulnerability to the pandemic 2009 H1N1 IAV in European and Asian populations. OBJECTIVE: Here, we estimated the disease susceptibility of the rs12252 SNP with the pandemic 2009 H1N1 IAV infection in the Korean population. RESULTS: We carried out direct sequencing of the IFITM3 gene and compared the genotype and allele frequencies of the rs12252 SNP of the IFITM3 gene in healthy Koreans and pandemic 2009 H1N1 IAV-infected patients. Notably, we observed that healthy individuals had a similar genotype distribution of the rs12252 SNP (P = 0.140) as patients. The dominant model and recessive model did not find a statistically significant difference in genotype distribution between healthy individuals and patients. In addition, the allele distribution of the rs12252 SNP of in healthy individuals and patients also showed a similar genetic distribution (P = 0.757). However, the genetic distribution of rs12252 SNP in merged patient group (Koreans and Chinese populations) showed significant association with susceptibility of pandemic 2009 IAV (P = 0.0393).

Hence, this study assessed the prevalence of mental health symptoms as well as emotional reactions among sub-Saharan Africans (SSAs) and associated factors among SSAs during the COVID-19 lockdown period. This was a web-based cross-sectional study on mental health and emotional features from 2005 respondents in seven SSA countries. This study was conducted between 17 April and 17 May 2020 corresponding to the lockdown period in most SSA countries. Respondents aged 18 years and above and the self-reported symptoms were feeling anxious, being worried, angry, bored and frustrated. These were the main outcomes and were treated as dichotomous variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify the factors associated with these symptoms. We found that over half (52.2%) of the participants reported any of the mental health symptoms and the prevalence of feeling bored was 70.5% followed by feeling anxious (59.1%), being worried (57.5%), frustrated (51.5%) and angry (22.3%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariate analysis revealed that males, those aged >28 years, those who lived in Central and Southern Africa, those who were not married, the unemployed, those living with more than six persons in a household, had higher odds of mental health and emotional symptoms. Similarly, people who perceived low risk of contracting the infection, and those who thought the pandemic would not continue after the lockdown had higher odds of mental health and emotional symptoms. Health care workers had lower odds for feeling angry than non-healthcare workers. During the COVID-19 lockdown periods in SSA, about one in two participants reported mental health and emotional symptoms.

With no consistent pattern of communication between St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (St. Jude) and its affiliated clinics, the Affiliate Program Office at St. Jude developed and implemented a standardized communication tool to facilitate patient transitions between different healthcare sites. METHODS: Each team of providers created flow diagrams to define the current state of communication when patients were transitioning between remote sites. Fishbone diagrams identified the common barriers to effective communication as a lack of consistent communication and ownership. We developed a communication tool to address these barriers, which was disseminated by secure email. We measured the percent usage of the completed hand-off tool before a patient transitioned, staff experience, and the number of errors. RESULTS: The time to send or receive the communication bundle was <10 minutes. Within 3 months of implementing the SMART bundle at 3 pilot sites, the bundle was used completely in 6 of 8 patient transitions and was associated with somewhat improved staff satisfaction.

Previous studies on its counterparts prove a complex and concomitant interaction between coronaviruses and autophagy. The precise manipulation of this pathway allows these viruses to exploit the autophagy molecular machinery while avoiding its protective apoptotic drift and cellular innate immune responses. In turn, the maneuverability margins of such hijacking appear to be so narrow that the modulation of the autophagy, regardless of whether using inducers or inhibitors (many of which are FDA-approved for the treatment of other diseases), is usually detrimental to viral replication, including SARS-CoV-2. Recent discoveries indicate that these interactions stretch into the still poorly explored noncanonical autophagy pathway, which might play a substantial role in coronavirus replication. Still, some potential therapeutic targets within this pathway, such as RAB9 and its interacting proteins, look promising considering current knowledge. Thus, the combinatory treatment of COVID-19 with drugs affecting both canonical and noncanonical autophagy pathways may be a turning point in the fight against this and other viral infections, which may also imply beneficial prospects of long-term protection.",2020,"Bello-Perez, Melissa; Sola, Isabel; Novoa, Beatriz; Klionsky, Daniel J; Falco, Alberto",,,#636152,,,,,220413095.0

A limited amount of data are available evaluating operative outcomes in comparison to standard laparoscopic surgery. We completed a retrospective review comparing robotic and laparoscopic ventral hernia repair to provide safety and outcomes data to help design a future prospective trial design. METHODS A retrospective review of 215 patients undergoing ventral hernia repair (142 robotic and 73 laparoscopic) was completed at two large academic centers. Primary outcome measure evaluated was recurrence. Secondary outcomes included incidence of primary fascial closure, and surgical site occurrences. RESULTS Propensity for treatment match comparison demonstrated that robotic repair was associated with a decreased incidence of recurrence (2.1 versus 4.2%, p < 0.001) and surgical site occurrence (4.2 versus 18.8%, p < 0.001). This may be because robotic repair was associated with increased incidence of primary fascial closure (77.1 versus 66.7%, p < 0.01). Analysis of baseline patient populations showed that robotic repairs were completed on patients with lower body mass index (28.1 ± 3.6 versus 34.2 ± 6.4, p < 0.001) and fewer comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS Our retrospective data show that robotic repair was associated with decreased recurrence and surgical site occurrence.

He predicted that the miracidium from hatched eggs uses crustaceans, such as fresh-water snails found at tropical conditions, as the intermediate hosts in the life cycle of many trematodes.

While COVID-19 severe forms share clinical and laboratory aspects with various pathologies such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, sepsis or cytokine release syndrome, their exact nature remains unknown. This is severely impeding the ability to treat patients facing severe stages of the disease. To this aim, we performed an in-depth, single-cell RNA-seq analysis of more than 150.000 immune cells isolated from matched blood samples and broncho-alveolar lavage fluids of COVID-19 patients and healthy controls, and integrated it with clinical, immunological and functional ex vivo data. We unveiled an immune signature of disease severity that correlated with the accumulation of naive lymphoid cells in the lung and an expansion and activation of myeloid cells in the periphery. Moreover, we demonstrated that myeloid-driven immune suppression is a hallmark of COVID-19 evolution and arginase 1 expression is significantly associated with monocyte immune regulatory features. Noteworthy, we found monocyte and neutrophil immune suppression loss associated with fatal clinical outcome in severe pa-tients. Additionally, our analysis discovered that the strongest association of the patients clinical outcome and immune phenotype is the lung T cell response. We found that patients with a robust CXCR6+ effector memory T cell response have better outcomes. This result is line with the rs11385942 COVID-19 risk allel, which is in proximity to the CXCR6 gene and suggest effector memory T cell are a primary feature in COVID-19 patients. By systemically quantifying the viral landscape in the lung of severe patients, we indeed identified Herpes-Simplex-Virus 1 (HSV-1) as a potential opportunistic virus in COVID-19 patients. Lastly, we observed an unexpectedly high SARS-CoV-2 viral load in an immuno-compromised patient, allowing us to study the SARS-CoV-2 in-vivo life cycle. The development of myeloid dysfunctions and the impairment of lymphoid arm establish a condition of immune paralysis that supports secondary bacteria and virus infection and can progress to immune silence in patients facing death.",2020-08-13,"Bost, P.; De Sanctis, F.; Cane, S.; Ugel, S.; Donadello, K.; Castellucci, M.; Eyal, D.; Fiore, A.; Anselmi, C.; Barouni, R.

Furthermore, there is presumably no pre-existing immunity in the population to the new coronavirus, and it is as-sumed that everyone in the population is susceptible. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the procedures described in the article is to minimize the risk of human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome - coronavirus 2) virus during procedures carried out in endoscopic laboratories. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF THE ART: SARS-CoV-2 infection can be asymptomatic, cause severe pneumonia, or lead to death. Symptoms of COVID-19 range from none (asymptomatic) to severe pneumonia and it can be fatal. Case studies to-date indicate that this infection causes a mild illness (i.e. pneumonia or mild pneumonia) in approximately 80% of cases, and most cases recove; 14% have a more severe illness, 6% experience a critical illness. The vast majority of the most serious illnesses and deaths have occurred among the elderly and people with other chronic underlying diseases. Average progression times include: â¢ in mild cases: from the onset of symptoms to recovery in almost 2 weeks; â¢ in severe cases: from the onset of symptoms to recovery in 3-6 weeks, and from symptoms to death in 2-8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Special precautions should be taken and procedures followed when performing invasive medical procedures in endoscopic laboratories in patients with specific or clinically probable SARS-CoV-2 infection.

These deliberate preemptive strategies may have profound impacts on the mental health of the population. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on Vietnamese people and associated factors. We conducted a cross-sectional study during a one-week social distancing and isolation from April 7 to 14, 2020, in Vietnam. A snowball sampling technique was carried out to recruit participants. Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was utilized to assess the psychological impacts of the COVID-19. Of all participants, 233 (16.4%) reported low level of PTSS; 76 (5.3%) rated as moderate, and 77 (5.4%) reported extreme psychological conditions. Being female, above 44 years old, or having a higher number of children in the family were positively associated with a higher level of psychological distress. Being self-employed/unemployed/retired was associated with a higher score of intrusion and hyperarousal subscale. Individuals who have a history of touching objects with the possibility of spreading coronavirus (utensils) were related to a higher level of avoidance. There were relatively high rates of participants suffering from PTSS during the first national lockdown related to COVID-19.

159016,5n4x6qej,,WHO,Persistence of Bacteriophage Phi 6 on Porous and Nonporous Surfaces and the Potential for Its Use as an Ebola Virus or Coronavirus Surrogate,,,,unk,"The infection of health care workers during the 2013 to 2016 Ebola outbreak raised concerns about fomite transmission. In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, investigations are ongoing to determine the role of fomites in coronavirus transmission as well. The bacteriophage phi 6 has a phospholipid envelope and is commonly used in environmental studies as a surrogate for human enveloped viruses. The persistence of phi 6 was evaluated as a surrogate for Ebola virus (EBOV) and coronaviruses on porous and nonporous hospital surfaces. Phi 6 was suspended in a body fluid simulant and inoculated onto 1-cm2 coupons of steel, plastic, and two fabric curtain types. The coupons were placed at two controlled absolute humidity (AH) levels: a low AH of 3.0 g/m3 and a high AH of 14.4 g/m3 Phi 6 declined at a lower rate on all materials under low-AH conditions, with a decay rate of 0.06-log10 PFU/day to 0.11-log10 PFU/day, than under the higher AH conditions, with a decay rate of 0.65-log10 PFU/h to 1.42-log10 PFU/day. There was a significant difference in decay rates between porous and nonporous surfaces at both low AH (P < 0.0001) and high AH (P < 0.0001). Under these laboratory-simulated conditions, phi 6 was found to be a conservative surrogate for EBOV under low-AH conditions in that it persisted longer than Ebola virus in similar AH conditions. Additionally, some coronaviruses persist longer than phi 6 under similar conditions; therefore, phi 6 may not be a suitable surrogate for coronaviruses.IMPORTANCE Understanding the persistence of enveloped viruses helps inform infection control practices and procedures in health care facilities and community settings. These data convey to public health investigators that enveloped viruses can persist and remain infective on surfaces, thus demonstrating a potential risk for transmission. Under these laboratory-simulated Western indoor hospital conditions, we assessed the suitability of phi 6 as a surrogate for environmental persistence research related to enveloped viruses, including EBOV and coronaviruses.",2020,"Whitworth, Carrie; Mu, Yi; Houston, Hollis; Martinez-Smith, Marla; Noble-Wang, Judith; Coulliette-Salmond, Angela; Rose, Laura",,,#767717,,,,,220120759.0

For patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens at our institution in the ambulatory infusion center, palonosetron was selected as the preferred serotonin (5-HT3) antagonist for CINV prophylaxis per the 2016 NCCN Guidelines, when a neurokinin1 antagonist was not included in the prophylactic regimen. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of dexamethasone and palonosetron versus granisetron for the prevention of CINV in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens. METHODS This study is an Institutional Review Board-approved, single-center retrospective review of electronic health records including patients who received moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens with CINV prophylaxis with dexamethasone and either palonosetron or granisetron. RESULTS A total of 268 eligible patients were included in the study. Eighty-eight patients received palonosetron and 180 patients received granisetron as their 5-HT3 receptor antagonist between October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2016. There were no statistically significant differences between the two antiemetic groups for the primary outcome of presence of any change in day 1 intravenous prophylactic antiemetics. Nine (10.23%) palonosetron patients and 15 (8.33%) granisetron patients required a change in their day 1 intravenous prophylactic antiemetics (P = 0.610). CONCLUSIONS Despite palonosetron's better efficacy, longer half-life, and higher binding affinity, the results of this retrospective review demonstrates that the choice of serotonin antagonist, palonosetron or granisetron, did not result in a change in day 1 intravenous prophylactic antiemetics or antiemetic outpatient medications for patients undergoing moderately emetogenic chemotherapy regimens.",2020-07-06,"Gamble, Melissa; Carroll, Elisabeth; Wright, Garth C; Glode, Ashley E",Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/1078155220938847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633661/,220386503.0

Comparison of tsm5 and the K181 (Birmingham) variant with the published K181 (Perth) MCMV genomic sequence revealed a total of 10 synonymous and 15 non‐synonymous SNPs in tsm5 and 14 of the latter were confirmed by sequencing. Thus, while CGS cannot be relied upon to identify correctly all mutations it was helpful for identifying a large number of mutations for further investigation that could contribute to the ts phenotype of tsm5.

Functionalized bacterial cell surfaces and exopolymers are thought to initiate mineral formation, however, direct evidences are hampered by technical challenges. Here, we present a breakthrough in the use of liquid-cell scanning transmission electron microscopy to observe mineral growth on bacteria and the exopolymers they secrete. Two Escherichia coli mutants producing distinct exopolymers are investigated. We use the incident electron beam to provoke and observe the precipitation of Mn-bearing minerals. Differences in the morphology and distribution of Mn precipitates on the two strains reflect differences in nucleation site density and accessibility. Direct observation under liquid conditions highlights the critical role of bacterial cell surface charges and exopolymer types in metal mineralization. This has strong environmental implications because biofilms structured by exopolymers are widespread in nature and constitute the main form of microbial life on Earth.",2020,"Couasnon, Thaïs; Alloyeau, Damien; Ménez, Bénédicte; Guyot, François; Ghigo, Jean-Marc; Gélabert, Alexandre",Sci.

The theoretical domains framework (TDF) was used to aid thematic analysis and identify relevant enablers of and barriers to optimal PPE use. RESULTS: Thirty-one behavioural themes were identified that influenced participants’ use of masks and gloves. There were significant differences, namely: more reported enablers of glove use vs more barriers to mask use. Reasons included more positive unit culture towards glove use, and lower perception of risk via facial contamination. CONCLUSION: Emerging infectious diseases, spread (among other routes) by respiratory droplets, have caused global outbreaks.

Since its outbreak, it has become a global pandemic. During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), however, there is no mature experience or guidance on how to carry out emergency surgery for suspected cases requiring emergency surgical intervention and perioperative safety protection against virus. CASE SUMMARY: A 41-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for emergency treatment due to ""3-d abdominal pain aggravated with cessation of exhaust and defecation"". After improving inspections and laboratory tests, the patient was assessed and diagnosed by the multiple discipline team as ""strangulation obstruction, pulmonary infection"". His body temperature was 38.8 °C, and the chest computed tomography showed pulmonary infection. Given fever and pneumonia, we could not rule out COVID-19 after consultation by fever clinicians and respiratory experts. Hence, we performed emergency surgery under three-level protection for the suspected case. After surgery, his nucleic acid test for COVID-19 was negative, meaning COVID-19 was excluded, and routine postoperative treatment and nursing was followed. The patient was treated with symptomatic support after the operation. The stomach tube and urinary tube were removed on the 1st d after the operation. The clearing diet was started on the 3rd d after the operation, and the body temperature returned to normal. Flatus and bowel movements were noted on 5th postoperative day. He was discharged after 8 d of hospitalization. The patient was followed up for 4 mo after discharge, no serious complications occurred. A 71-year-old woman was admitted to our emergency room due to ""abdominal distention, fatigue for 6 d and fever for 13 h"". After the multiple discipline team evaluation, the patient was diagnosed as ""intestinal obstruction, abdominal mass, peritonitis and pulmonary infection"". At that time, the patient's body temperature was 39.6 °C, and chest computed tomography indicated pulmonary infection. COVID-19 could not be completely excluded after consultation in the fever outpatient department and respiratory department. Therefore, the patient was treated as a suspected case, and an urgent operation was performed under three-level medical protection. Postoperative nucleic acid test was negative, COVID-19 was excluded, and routine postoperative treatment and nursing were followed. After the operation, the patient received symptomatic and supportive treatment. The gastric tube was removed on the 1st d after the operation, and the urinary tube was removed on the 3rd d after the operation. Enteral nutrition began on the 3rd d after the operation. To date, no serious complications have been found during follow-up after discharge. CONCLUSION: Based on the previous treatment experience, we reviewed the procedures of two cases of suspected COVID-19 emergency surgery and extracted the perioperative protection experience. By referring to the literature and following the regulations on prevention and management of infectious diseases, we have developed a relatively mature and complete emergency surgical workflow for suspected COVID-19 cases and shared perioperative protection and management experience and measures.",2020,"Wu, Di; Xie, Tian-Yu; Sun, Xue-Hong; Wang, Xin-Xin",World J Clin Cases,,#955211,,,,,227239935.0

Single-port sleeve gastrectomy (SPSG) is more popular since each abdominal incision carries the risk of bleeding, hernia, and internal organ injury as well as exponentially affecting cosmesis. This cross-sectional study aimed at comparing multi-port sleeve gastrectomy (MPSG) and SPSG in terms of their early results and complications. METHODS Out of129 obese patients candidated for LSG, 102 patients were assigned to 2 groups of SPSG and MPSG. Complications and demographic data such as body mass index (BMI), age, gender, operation time, and hospital stay were measured. All surgeries were carried out between2013 and 2015 in Shiraz, Iran. Data analysis was performed using SPSS, version 16 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The continuous and categorical variables were compared using the Student t-test and the Chi-square test or the Fisher exact test, respectively. RESULTS The patients' data from both groups were similar in terms of age, intraoperative and postoperative bleeding volume, and length of hospital stay. Mean BMI was 42.8±0.7 in the SPSG group and 45.3±1.2 in the MPSG group. Duration of surgery was significantly lower in the SPSG group (P<0.001). Only 1 patient from the SPSG group and 5 patients from the MPSG group had bleeding as an early complication. CONCLUSION The differences in each complication between the groups were not statistically significant. SPSG seems to be safe and is the same as MPSG in terms of major postoperative complications.

Accumulating evidence suggests that IgA or anti-FcαRI could also represent an exciting avenue toward novel therapeutic strategies. SUMMARY Here, we underline that IgA is more effective in recruiting neutrophils for tumor cell killing and is potently active against several pathogens, including rotavirus, poliovirus, influenza virus, and SARS-CoV-2. IgA could also be used to modulate excessive immune responses in inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, secretory IgA is emerging as a major regulator of gut microbiota, which impacts intestinal homeostasis and global health as well. As such, IgA could be used to promote a healthy microbiota in a therapeutic setting.

METHODS: A total of 100 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in intensive care unit (ICU) were enrolled and classified into moderate (n=17), severe (n=40) and critical groups (n=43). Clinical information and laboratory results were collected and the concentrations of ferritin were compared among different groups. The association between ferritin and mortality was evaluated by logistic regression analysis. Moreover, the efficiency of the predicting value was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: The amount of ferritin was significantly higher in critical group compared with moderate and severe groups. The median of ferritin concentration was about three times higher in death group than survival group (1722.25µg/L vs. 501.90µg/L, p<0.01). The concentration of ferritin was positively correlated with other inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-8, IL-10, C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#945;. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that ferritin was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. Especially, high-ferritin group was associated with higher incidence of mortality, with adjusted odds ratio of 104.97 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.63-4185.89; p=0.013]. Moreover, ferritin had an advantage of discriminative capacity with the area under ROC (AUC) of 0.822 (95% CI 0.737-0.907) higher than procalcitonin and CRP.

Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) exerts a variety of biological effects. However, the role of IGF-1 in myocarditis remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS LDL-R knockout mice were randomly divided into the control group, myocarditis group, and IGF-1 siRNA group. Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Western blot were used to measure IGF-1 expression in myocardial tissue. The myocardial tissue changes were analyzed by HE staining. The total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) in each group were detected. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the number of macrophages. The secretion of TNF-α and INF-γ and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS Compared with the control group, IGF-1 expression, TC, and LDL in myocarditis group was significantly increased, along with decreased heart rate (HR), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVEDs), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDd), and left ventricular mass index (LVMI). In addition, inflammatory cell infiltration, fibrosis, and macrophages number in the peritoneum were increased. Moreover, the secretion of TNF-α, INF-γ, and MIF was also significantly increased (p<0.05). However, IGF-1 siRNA treatment inhibited IGF-1 expression and reversed the changes in the myocarditis group with statistically significant differences compared with the myocarditis group (p<0.05).

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus are common causes of infantile lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). It is widely believed that both viral replication and inappropriately enhanced immune responses contribute to disease severity. In infants, RSV LRTI is known to be more severe than influenza virus LRTI. Methods. We compared cytokines and chemokines in secretions of infants surviving various forms of respiratory illness caused by RSV or influenza viruses, to determine which mediators were associated with more-severe illness. We analyzed lung tissue from infants with fatal cases of RSV and influenza virus LRTI to determine the types of inflammatory cells present. Autopsy tissues were studied for the lymphotoxin granzyme and the apoptosis marker caspase 3. Results. Quantities of lymphocyte-derived cytokines were minimal in secretions from infants with RSV infection. Concentrations of most cytokines were greater in influenza virus, rather than RSV, infection. Lung tissues from infants with fatal RSV and influenza virus LRTI demonstrated an extensive presence of viral antigen and a near absence of CD8-positive lymphocytes and natural killer cells, with marked expression of markers of apoptosis.

The very rapid spreading of the virus worldwide, with its heavy toll of death and overload of the healthcare systems, induced the scientific community to focus on understanding, monitoring and foreseeing the epidemic evolution, weighing up the impact of different containment measures. An immense literature was produced in few months. Many papers were focused on predicting the peak features through a variety of different models. In the present paper, combining the surveillance data-set with data on mobility and testing, we develop a deterministic compartment model aimed at performing a retrospective analysis to understand the main modifications occurred to the characteristic parameters that regulate the epidemic spreading. We find that, besides self-protective behaviors, a reduction of susceptibility should have occurred in order to explain the fast descent of the epidemic after the peak. A sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number, in response to variations of the epidemiological parameters that can be influenced by policy-makers, shows the primary importance of a rigid isolation procedure for the diagnosed cases, combined with an intensive effort in performing extended testing campaigns.

METHODS: Subjects included 190 COVID‐19 patients, 190 healthy subjects, and 105 influenza pneumonia (IP) patients. COVID‐19 patients were divided into the ARDS and non‐ARDS groups. Routine blood examination, biochemistry indicator, days in hospital, body temperature, pneumonia severity index (PSI), CURB‐65, and MuLBSTA were recorded. Correlations between variables were assessed using Spearman's correlation analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to study the accuracy of the various diagnostic tests. RESULTS: Compared with healthy subjects, COVID‐19 patients had lower white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte, platelet, and hemoglobin levels; higher percentages of neutrophils and monocytes; lower percentages of lymphocytes and higher neutrophil‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and platelet‐to‐lymphocyte ratio (PLR) values (P < .05). COVID‐19 patients had higher WBC and neutrophil levels and lower percentages of lymphocytes compared to IP (P < .05). ROC curve analysis revealed that MLR had a high diagnostic value in differentiating COVID‐19 patients from healthy subjects, but not from IP patients. NLR showed significant positive correlations with PSI, CURB‐65, and MuLBSTA. Lymphocyte count was lower in the ARDS group and yielded a higher diagnostic value than the other variables. CONCLUSIONS: Monocyte‐to‐lymphocyte ratio showed an acceptable efficiency to separate COVID‐19 patients from healthy subjects, but failed to rule out IP patients.

Teriflunomide is an immunomodulatory drug approved for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) treatment that inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway. This mechanism can produce antiviral effects, thus teriflunomide has gained attention during COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, in the last months, some case-reports have been published describing MS patients treated with teriflunomide who developed mild and self-limiting forms of COVID-19. METHODS: Here, we describe the case of a 57-year-old man affected by MS, and treated with teriflunomide, who developed a mild form of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, we provide a detailed literature review about the available cases of COVID-19 in MS patients treated with teriflunomide. We report clinical features, disease course and outcome, and we discuss similarities and differences among patients. RESULTS: Apart from the present report, since February 2020, five papers have been published describing 14 MS patients who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection during teriflunomide treatment. Patients were mostly female (53%), with an average age of 50.5 (±11.3) years. Median EDSS was 2.25 (range 0–6). The average time on treatment with teriflunomide was 3.7 (± 1.6) years. Relevant comorbidities were present in 4 patients (27%). Regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, the most common symptom was fever (100%) followed by gastrointestinal disturbances (67%), fatigue (55%) and cough (55%). 5 patients were hospitalized and 2 required oxygen support. In patient hospitalized (n=5) compared to the others (n=10), age was significantly higher (59.6 vs 45.9 years, p=0.025) while gender, EDSS, duration of teriflunomide therapy and comorbidities were not significantly different. Outcome was good for all patients with a variable recovery time, ranging from few days to some weeks. Teriflunomide was continued during the entire course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in all patients except for two. Compared to the patients already described, our patient was 7 years older, average time on teriflunomide treatment was about 2.5 years shorter, and median EDSS was 1.5 point lower. Despite significant comorbidities, the outcome was good since our patient was hospitalized but he did not require oxygen supplementation nor intensive care and was able to return at home after only 10 days. Teriflunomide therapy was continued throughout the period. CONCLUSION: Available data suggest that teriflunomide therapy should not be discontinued in MS patients who develop SARS-CoV-2 infection, also in presence of significant comorbidities or clinical conditions requiring hospitalization. Additional studies are necessary to assess if the drug can also have a protective role against SARS-CoV-2.",2021-01-02,"Capone, Fioravante; Motolese, Francesco; Luce, Tiziano; Rossi, Mariagrazia; Magliozzi, Alessandro; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/5aca8cb26bb90f1ccef9a0b6948dd89f61f59edd.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7836732.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33429305/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211034820308087; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102734; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034820308087,231584588.0

METHODS: We extended and optimized our previous recombinant adenovirus 5 (rAd5)–based vaccine platform characterized by in vivo amplified and CD40-mediated specific responses to generate MERS-CoV S1 subunit-based vaccine. We generated rAd5 constructs expressing CD40-targeted S1 fusion protein (rAd5-S1/F/CD40L), untargeted S1 (rAd5-S1), and Green Fluorescent Protein (rAd5-GFP), and evaluated their efficacy and safety in human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 transgenic (hDPP4 Tg(+)) mice. RESULTS: Immunization of hDPP4 Tg(+) mice with a single dose of rAd5-S1/F/CD40L elicited as robust and significant specific immunoglobulin G and neutralizing antibodies as those induced with 2 doses of rAd5-S1. After MERS-CoV challenge, both vaccines conferred complete protection against morbidity and mortality, as evidenced by significantly undetectable/reduced pulmonary viral loads compared to the control group. However, rAd5-S1– but not rAd5-S1/F/CD40L–immunized mice exhibited marked pulmonary perivascular hemorrhage post–MERS-CoV challenge despite the observed protection.

We create a geometric analysis method (called GenomeLandscaper) to conduct landscape analysis of genome-fingerprints maps (GFM), trace large-scale repetitive regions, and assess their impacts on the global architectures of assembled chromosomes. We develop an alignment-free method for phylogenetics analysis. The human Y chromosomes (GRCh.chrY, HuRef.chrY and YH.chrY) are analysed as a proof-of-concept study. We construct a galaxy of genome-fingerprints maps (GGFM) for them, and a landscape compatibility among relatives is observed. But a long sharp straight line on the GGFM breaks such a landscape compatibility, distinguishing GRCh38p1.chrY (and throughout GRCh38p7.chrY) from GRCh37p13.chrY, HuRef.chrY and YH.chrY. We delete a 1.30-Mbp target segment to rescue the landscape compatibility, matching the antecedent GRCh37p13.chrY. We re-locate it into the modelled centromeric and pericentromeric region of GRCh38p10.chrY, matching a gap placeholder of GRCh37p13.chrY. We decompose it into sub-constituents (such as BACs, interspersed repeats, and tandem repeats) and trace their homologues by phylogenetics analysis. We elucidate that most examined tandem repeats are of reasonable quality, but the BAC-sized repeats, 173U1020C (176.46 Kbp) and 5U41068C (205.34 Kbp), are likely over-repeated.

Through an appropriate combination of the momentum equation with the rheological model for Maxwell fluids, an hyperbolic partial differential equation is obtained and semi-analytically solved by using the Laplace transform method to describe the velocity field. In the solution process, different electrostatic conditions and electro-viscous stresses have to be considered in the liquid-liquid interfaces due to the transported fluids content buffer solutions based on symmetrical electrolytes. By adopting a dimensionless mathematical model for the governing and constitutive equations, certain dimensionless parameters that control the start-up of electroosmotic flow appear, as the viscosity ratios, dielectric permittivity ratios, the density ratios, the relaxation times, the electrokinetic parameters and the potential differences. In the results, it is shown that the velocity exhibits an oscillatory behavior in the transient regime as a consequence of the competition between the viscous and elastic forces; also, the flow field is affected by the electrostatic conditions at the liquid-liquid interfaces, producing steep velocity gradients, and finally, the time to reach the steady-state is strongly dependent on the relaxation times, viscosity ratios and the number of fluid layers.",2020-08-05,"Escandón, Juan; Torres, David; Hernández, Clara; Vargas, René",Micromachines,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.3390/mi11080757; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764332/,221075577.0

Methods: In this observational retrospective study, COVID-19 positive cases (total 417) diagnosed in Al Kuwait Hospital, Dubai, UAE were recruited, and their prognosis in terms of admission to the hospital and the need for intensive care was reviewed until their tests turned negative. Patients were classified according to their clinical state into mild, moderate, severe, and critical.

254731,863m07vh,,WHO,Immediate impact of COVID-19 on transplant activity in the Netherlands,,,,unk,"The rapid emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and poses an unparalleled obstacle in the sixty-five year history of organ transplantation. Worldwide, the delivery of transplant care is severely challenged by matters concerning - but not limited to - organ procurement, risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, screening strategies of donors and recipients, decisions to postpone or proceed with transplantation, the attributable risk of immunosuppression for COVID-19 and entrenched health care resources and capacity. The transplant community is faced with choosing a lesser of two evils: initiating immunosuppression and potentially accepting detrimental outcome when transplant recipients develop COVID-19 versus postponing transplantation and accepting associated waitlist mortality. Notably, prioritization of health care services for COVID-19 care raises concerns about allocation of resources to deliver care for transplant patients who might otherwise have excellent 1-year and 10-year survival rates. Children and young adults with end-stage organ disease in particular seem more disadvantaged by withholding transplantation because of capacity issues than from medical consequences of SARS-CoV-2. This report details the nationwide response of the Dutch transplant community to these issues and the immediate consequences for transplant activity. Worrisome, there was a significant decrease in organ donation numbers affecting all organ transplant services. In addition, there was a detrimental effect on transplantation numbers in children with end-organ failure. Ongoing efforts focus on mitigation of not only primary but also secondary harm of the pandemic and to find right definitions and momentum to restore the transplant programs.",2020,"de Vries, A P J; Alwayn, I P J; Hoek, R A S; van den Berg, A P; Ultee, F C W; Vogelaar, S M; Haase-Kromwijk, B J J M; Heemskerk, M B A; Hemke, A C; Nijboer, W N; Schaefer, B S; Kuiper, M A; de Jonge, J; van der Kaaij, N P; Reinders, M E J",Transpl Immunol,,#154625,,,,,218468054.0

However, the specific role of striatal GABAergic neuronal activity in the promotion of neurological recovery after ischemic stroke remains unknown. Here, we used optogenetic approach to investigate these effects and mechanism. METHODS Laser stimulation was delivered via an implanted optical fiber to inhibit or activate the striatal GABAergic neurons in Gad2-Arch-GFP or Gad2-ChR2-tdTomato mice (n=80) 1 week after 60-minute transient middle cerebral artery occlusion. Neurological severity score, brain atrophy volume, microvessel density, and cell morphological changes were examined using immunohistochemistry. Gene expression and protein levels of related growth factors were further examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting. RESULTS Inhibiting striatal GABAergic neuronal activity improved functional recovery, reduced brain atrophy volume, and prohibited cell death compared with the control (P<0.05). Microvessel density and bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor) expression in the inhibition group were also increased (P<0.05). In contrast, activation of striatal GABAergic neurons resulted in adverse effects compared with the control (P<0.05). Using cocultures of GABAergic neurons, astrocytes, and endothelial cells, we further demonstrated that the photoinhibition of GABAergic neuronal activity could upregulate bFGF expression in endothelial cells, depending on the presence of astrocytes. The conditioned medium from the aforementioned photoinhibited 3-cell coculture system protected cells from oxygen glucose deprivation injury. CONCLUSIONS After ischemic stroke, optogenetic inhibition of GABAergic neurons upregulated bFGF expression by endothelial cells and promoted neurobehavioral recovery, possibly orchestrated by astrocytes.

Four human CoVs (HCoVs), the non-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like HCoVs (namely HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43, and HKU1), are globally endemic and account for a substantial fraction of upper respiratory tract infections. Non-SARS-like CoV can occasionally produce severe diseases in frail subjects but do not cause any major (fatal) epidemics. In contrast, SARS like CoVs (namely SARS-CoV and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV) can cause intense short-lived fatal outbreaks. The current epidemic caused by the highly contagious SARS-CoV-2 and its rapid spread globally is of major concern. There is scanty knowledge on the actual pandemic potential of this new SARS-like virus. It might be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is grossly underdiagnosed and that the infection is silently spreading across the globe with two consequences: (i) clusters of severe infections among frail subjects could haphazardly occur linked to unrecognized index cases; (ii) the current epidemic could naturally fall into a low-level endemic phase when a significant number of subjects will have developed immunity. Understanding the role of paucisymptomatic subjects and stratifying patients according to the risk of developing severe clinical presentations is pivotal for implementing reasonable measures to contain the infection and to reduce its mortality. Whilst the future evolution of this epidemic remains unpredictable, classic public health strategies must follow rational patterns.

We determined the prevalence of asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 and characterized the symptoms of patients with mild COVID-19. METHODS: Study participants were recruited from a community facility designated for the isolation of patients without moderate-to-severe symptoms of COVID-19 in South Korea. The prevalence of asymptomatic patients at admission and the detailed symptoms of mild COVID-19 were evaluated through a questionnaire-based survey. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: Of the 213 individuals with COVID-19, 41 (19.2%) were asymptomatic until admission. Among the remaining patients with mild COVID-19, the most common symptom was cough (40.1%; 69/172), followed by hyposmia (39.5%; 68/172) and sputum (39.5%; 68/172). Of the 68 individuals with hyposmia, 61 (90%) had accompanying symptoms such as hypogeusia, nasal congestion or rhinorrhoea. Fever (>37.5°C) was only observed in 20 (11.6%) individuals. CONCLUSIONS: As much as one-fifth of individuals with COVID-19 remained asymptomatic from exposure to admission. Hyposmia was quite frequent among individuals with mild COVID-19, but fever was not.

A COS represents an agreed standardized set of outcomes that describes the minimum that should be consistently reported in all clinical trials of a defined area. It comprises a core domain set (defining what core outcomes should be measured) and a core measurement set (defining measurement/assessment instruments for each core domain). For pressure ulcer prevention trials a COS is lacking. The great heterogeneity of reported outcomes in this field indicates the need for a COS. METHODS/DESIGN The first part of this project aims to develop a core domain set by following established methods, which incorporates four steps: (1) definition of the scope, (2) conducting a scoping review, (3) organizing facilitated workshops with service users, (4) performing Delphi surveys and establishing consensus in a face-to-face meeting with different stakeholders. DISCUSSION After achieving consensus on the core domain set, further work will be undertaken to determine a corresponding core measurement set. This will lead to better pressure ulcer prevention research in the future. There are a number of methodological challenges in the field of COS development. To meet these challenges and to ensure a high-quality COS, the OUTPUTS project affiliates to current standards and works in close collaboration with international experts and with existing international service user groups.

Conventionally, many researchers have directly applied regression analysis. However, interpreting the effect of weather on these loads is difficult with the existing methods. In this study, we build a statistical model that resolves this interpretation issue. A varying coefficient model with basis expansion is used to capture the nonlinear structure of the weather effect. This approach results in an interpretable model when the regression coefficients are nonnegative. To estimate the nonnegative regression coefficients, we employ nonnegative least squares. Three real data analyses show the practicality of our proposed statistical modeling. Two of them demonstrate good forecast accuracy and interpretability of our proposed method.

Yet the potential impact of suspending elective surgery on ICU bed capacity is unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 5 years of New York State data on ICU usage. Descriptions of ICU utilization and mechanical ventilation were stratified by admission type (elective surgery, emergent/urgent/trauma surgery, and medical admissions) and by geographic location (New York metropolitan region versus the rest of New York State). Data are presented as absolute numbers and percentages and all adult and pediatric ICU patients were included. RESULTS: Overall, ICU admissions in New York State were seen in 10.1% of all hospitalizations (n = 1,232,986/n = 12,251,617) and remained stable over a 5-year period from 2011 to 2015. Among n = 1,232,986 ICU stays, sources of ICU admission included elective surgery (13.4%, n = 165,365), emergent/urgent admissions/trauma surgery (28.0%, n = 345,094), and medical admissions (58.6%, n = 722,527). Ventilator utilization was seen in 26.3% (n = 323,789/n = 1232,986) of all ICU patients of which 6.4% (n = 20,652), 32.8% (n = 106,186), and 60.8% (n = 196,951) was for patients from elective, emergent, and medical admissions, respectively. New York City holds the majority of ICU bed capacity (70.0%; n = 2496/n = 3566) in New York State. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing elective surgery comprised a small fraction of ICU bed and mechanical ventilation use in New York State. Suspension of elective surgeries in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may thus have a minor impact on ICU capacity when compared to other sources of ICU admission such as emergent/urgent admissions/trauma surgery and medical admissions.

Currently, no specific prophylactic and therapeutic treatment is available. No evidence from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that a treatment may ameliorate the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19 exists with the only exception of preliminary evidence from remdesivir trials. Here, we present evidence from the literature and a compelling hypothesis on the potential immunomodulatory, iron chelating and anti-oxidant effects of iron chelators in the treatment of COVID-19 and its complications. Interestingly, iron chelation has been shown in vitro to suppress endothelial inflammation in viral infection, which is the main pathophysiologic mechanism behind systemic organ involvement induced by SARS-CoV-2, by inhibiting IL-6 synthesis through decreasing NF-kB. Iron chelators exhibit iron chelating, antiviral and immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo, particularly against RNA viruses. These agents could attenuate ARDS and help control SARS-CoV-2 via multiple mechanisms including: 1) inhibition of viral replication; 2) decrease of iron availability; 3) upregulation of B cells; 4) improvement of the neutralizing anti-viral antibody titer; 5) inhibition of endothelial inflammation and 6) prevention of pulmonary fibrosis and lung decline via reduction of pulmonary iron accumulation.

(Aim) This systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of LPV/RTV in COVID-19 patients in the published research. (Methods) A protocol was developed based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. Articles were selected for review from 8 electronic databases. This review evaluated the effects of LPV/RTV alone or in combination with standard care ± interferons/antiviral treatments compared to other therapies, regarding duration of hospital stay, risk of progressing to invasive mechanical, time to virological cure and body temperature normalization, cough relief, radiological progression, mortality and safety. (Results) A consensus was reached to select 32 articles for full-text screening; only 14 articles comprising 9036 patients were included in this study; and eight of these were included for meta-analysis. Most of these studies did not report positive clinical outcomes with LPV/RTV treatment. In terms of virological cure, three studies reported less time in days to achieve a virological cure for LPV/RTV arm relative to no antiviral treatment (-0.81 day; 95% confidence interval (CI), -4.44 to 2.81; p = 0.007, I2 = 80%). However, the overall effect was not significant (p = 0.66). When comparing the LPV/RTV arm to umifenovir arm, a favorable affect was observed for umifenovir arm, but not statically significant (p = 0.09). In terms of time to body normalization and cough relief, no favorable effects of LPV/RTV versus umifenovir were observed. The largest trials (RECOVERY and SOLIDARITY) have shown that LPV/RTV failed to reduce mortality, initiation of invasive mechanical ventilation or hospitalization duration. Adverse events were reported most frequently for LPV/RTV (n = 84) relative to other antivirals and no antiviral treatments. (Conclusions) This review did not reveal any significant advantage in efficacy of LPV/RTV for the treatment of COVID-19 over standard care, no antivirals or other antiviral treatments.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to evaluate whether a Web-based intervention can encourage more frequent hand-washing in the home, and to examine potential mediators and moderators of outcomes, as a necessary first step before testing effects of the intervention on infection rates in the PRIMIT trial (PRimary care trial of a website based Infection control intervention to Modify Influenza-like illness and respiratory infection Transmission). METHODS: In a parallel-group pragmatic exploratory trial design, 517 nonblinded adults recruited through primary care were automatically randomly assigned to a fully automated intervention comprising 4 sessions of tailored motivational messages and self-regulation support (n = 324) or to a no-intervention control group (n = 179; ratio 2:1). Hand-washing frequency and theory of planned behavior cognitions relating to hand-washing were assessed by online questionnaires at baseline (in only half of the control participants, to permit evaluation of effects of baseline assessment on effect sizes), at 4 weeks (postintervention; all participants), and at 12 weeks. RESULTS: Hand-washing rates in the intervention group were higher at 4 weeks than in the control group (mean 4.40, n = 285 and mean 4.04, n = 157, respectively; P < .001, Cohen d = 0.42) and remained higher at 12 weeks (mean 4.45, n = 282 and mean 4.12, n = 154, respectively; P < .001, Cohen d = 0.34). Hand-washing intentions and positive attitudes toward hand-washing increased more from baseline to 4 weeks in the intervention group than in the control group. Mediation analyses revealed positive indirect effects of the intervention on change in hand-washing via intentions (coefficient = .15, 95% confidence interval [CI], .08–.26) and attitudes (coefficient = 0.16, 95% CI, .09–.26). Moderator analyses confirmed that the intervention was similarly effective for men and women, those of higher and lower socioeconomic status, and those with higher and lower levels of perceived risk. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides promising evidence that Web-based interventions could potentially provide an effective method of promoting hand hygiene in the home. Data were collected during the 2010 influenza pandemic, when participants in both groups had already been exposed to extensive publicity about the need for hand hygiene, suggesting that our intervention could add to existing public health campaigns.

Building evidence during the COVID-19 emergency reported that around 50% of patients in Italy treated with NIV-CPAP avoided the need for invasive mechanical ventilation.

Furthermore, open configuration systems require a high concentration of oxygen to deliver the desired FiO2 . Concerns outlined the risk for aerosolization in the ambient and the possible pressure drop in hospital supply pipes. A new NIV-CPAP system is proposed that includes automatic control of patient respiratory parameters. The system operates as a closed-loop breathing circuit that can be assembled, combining a sleep apnea machine with existing commercially available components. Analytical simulation of breathing patient and simulation with a healthy volunteer at different FiO2 were performed. Inspired and expired oxygen fraction, inspired and expired carbon dioxide pressure were recorded at different CPAP levels with different oxygen delivery. Among the main findings, we report (1) a significant (up to 30-fold) reduction in oxygen feeding compared to standard open high flow NIV-CPAP systems, to assure the same FiO2 levels, and (2) a negligible production of the noise generated in ventilatory systems, and consequent minimization of patients' discomfort.

Testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cornerstone of an effective public health response. However, efforts to test have been hampered by limited reagents, limitations in the availability of swabs used for the collection of nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimens, limitations in personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care providers collecting the NPS specimens, and limitations in viral transport media for transporting the specimens. Therefore, more flexible options for screening for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses are critical to inform clinical and public health responses. OBJECTIVE: We aim to document the ability of patients to self-collect sufficient specimens for SARS-CoV-2 viral detection and serology. METHODS: Patient self-collection of samples will be done with observation by a health care provider during a telemedicine session. Participants will be mailed a specimen collection kit, engage in a telehealth session with a provider through a HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996)-compliant video meeting, and collect specimens while being observed by the provider. Providers will record whether they are confident in the suitability of the specimen for laboratory testing that would inform clinical decision making. We will objectively assess the sufficiency of biological material in the mailed-in specimens. RESULTS: The protocol was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB) on March 30, 2020 (Protocol number 371). To date, we have enrolled 159 participants. CONCLUSIONS: Defining a conceptual framework for assessing the sufficiency of patient-collected samples for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serologic responses to infection is critical for facilitating public health responses and providing PPE-sparing options to increase testing.

Also, the pathophysiological mechanism of sound perception in patients with VPT remains poorly understood. In the present study, a novel surgical method, termed transmastoid SS-reshaping surgery, was introduced to ameliorate VPT in patients with DSSD/T. The authors reviewed a case series, analyzed the surgical outcomes, and suggested the pathophysiological mechanism of sound perception. The theoretical background underlying VPT improvement after transmastoid SS-reshaping surgery was also explored. METHODS Eight patients with VPT that was considered attributable to DSSD/T underwent transmastoid SS-reshaping surgery between February 2010 and February 2015. The mean postoperative follow-up period was 9.5 months (range 4-13 months). Transmastoid SS-reshaping surgery featured simple mastoidectomy, partial compression of the SS using harvested cortical bone chips, and reinforcement of the bony SS wall with bone cement. Perioperative medical records, imaging results, and audiological findings were comprehensively reviewed. RESULTS In 7 of the 8 patients (87.5%), the VPT abated immediately after surgery. Statistically significant improvements in tinnitus loudness and distress were evident on numeric rating scales. Three patients with preoperative ipsilesional low-frequency hearing loss exhibited postoperative improvements in their low-frequency hearing thresholds. No major postoperative complications were encountered except in the first subject, who experienced increased intracranial pressure postoperatively. This subsided after a revision operation for partial decompression of the SS. CONCLUSIONS Transmastoid SS-reshaping surgery may be a good surgical option in patients with DSSD/T, a previously unrecognized cause of VPT.

The molecular mechanisms underpinning the age-dependent disparity for disease progression is not clear. COVID-19 is both a respiratory and a vascular disease in severe patients. The damage endothelial system provides a good explanation for the various complications seen in COVID-19 patients. These observations lead us to suspect that endothelial cells are a barrier that must be breached before progression to severe disease. Endothelial intracellular defences are largely dependent of the activation of the interferon (IFN) system. Nevertheless, low type I and III IFNs are generally observed in COVID-19 patients suggesting that other intracellular viral defence systems are also activated to protect the young. Intriguingly, Nitric oxide (NO), which is the main intracellular antiviral defence, has been shown to inhibit a wide array of viruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Additionally, the increased risk of death with diseases that have underlying endothelial dysfunction suggest that endothelial NOS-derived nitric oxide could be the main defence mechanism. NO decreases dramatically in the elderly, the hyperglycaemic and the patients with lowlevels of vitamin D. However, eNOS derived NO occurs at low levels, unless it is during inflammation and co-stimulated by bradykinin. Regrettably, the bradykinin-induced vasodilation also progressively declines with age, thereby decreasing anti-viral NO production as well. These changes with age, low bradykinin and NO, may be thefundamental reasons that intracellular innate immunity declines with age leading tomore severe COVID-19 complications.",2020-11-04,"Guan, Shou Ping; Raymond Seet, Chee Seong; Kennedy, Brian K.",Ageing Res Rev,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/7fabe5854f0de90ff8bcd9318634879bb1a57256.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7609225.xml.json,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2020.101201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33157320/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1568163720303366; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163720303366?v=s5,226238561.0

Contrary to this, another RAS component, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) catalyzes synthesis of Ang II from angiotensin I (Ang I) that functions as active compound in blood pressure regulation. This indicates importance of ACE/ACE2 level in regulating blood pressure by targeting Ang II. An outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) highlighted the additional role of ACE2 as a receptor for SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Activation of spike (S)-protein by either type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) or cathepsin-mediated cleavage initiates receptor binding and viral entry. In addition to TTSPs, ACE2 can also be trimmed by ADAM 17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17) that competes for the same receptor. Cleavage by TTSPs activates ACE2 receptor for binding, whereas ADAM17 releases extracellular fragment called soluble ACE2 (sACE2). Structural studies of both ACE2 and S-protein have found critical sites involved in binding mechanism. In addition to studies on structural motifs, few single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) studies have been done to find an association between genetic variants and SARS susceptibility. Though no association was found in those reports, but seeing the non-reproducibility of SNP studies among different ethnic groups, screening of ACE2 SNPs in individual population can be undertaken. SHORT CONCLUSION: Thus, screening for novel SNPs focussing on recently identified critical regions of ACE2 can be targeted to monitor susceptibility towards coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).",2020-09-21,"Chaudhary, Mayank",Egypt J Med Hum Genet,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/f9fd46e6cd1987f075fa9e9e9c89913c9b0bd99c.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC7502288.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7502288/,

Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a conceptual one based on a review of literature relating to the acquisiting and use of secondary residences or “second homes”. Findings: This paper observes that the secondary residence is often the object of a material over-investment that is symbolic and mental. The owners never quite leave their main place of residence when in the secondary one. The result is not two complementary spaces, but a hybrid space made up of the interlocking of the two. This paper also concludes that digitalization has made it easier to rent a secondary residence for a short period of time, using for instance the Airbnb platform, thus making it more an object of trade than a second home. From a sustainability perspective, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to bring to the relatively rapid growth of short-term renting a halt. Further, it may encourage owners to be more psychologically and physically invested in their secondary residence, thereby contributing more to the local economy.

Apart from the risk of intestinal damage following adhesiolysis, to date no information is available on the best way of preventing the formation of new adhesions in the vicinity of the implanted meshes. Numerous experimental investigations, mainly conducted on an open small-animal model, have demonstrated the advantages of coating meshes, inter alia with absorbable materials, compared with uncoated polypropylene meshes. In our established laparoscopic porcine model we set about investigating three of these meshes, which are already available on the market. MATERIALS AND METHODS In total, 18 domestic pigs underwent laparoscopic surgery and three different composite meshes were tested in each case on six animals (Dynamesh IPOM, Proceed, Parietene Composite). At 4 months, postmortem diagnostic laparoscopy was carried out, followed by full-wall excision of the specimens. Planimetric analysis was conducted to investigate the size of the entire surface area and the extent of adhesions. Histological investigations were performed on five sections for each specimen. These focused on the partial volumes of inflammatory cells, the proliferation marker Ki67, apoptotic index, inflammatory cell marker CD68 and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) as a marker of the extracellular matrix. RESULTS A similar value of 14% was obtained for shrinkage of Dynamesh IPOM and Parietene Composite, while Proceed showed a 25% reduction in its surface area. Markedly lower values of 12.8% were obtained for Parietene Composite in respect of adhesions to the greater omentum, compared with 31.7% for Proceed and 33.2% for Dynamesh IPOM (p = 0.01). Overall, Parietene Composite performed best in the histological and immunhistochemistry tests. CONCLUSIONS On the whole, all composite meshes showed evidence of good biocompatibility. However, none of the coatings was completely able to prevent adhesions.

An MTT assay was performed to determine cytotoxicity effect, and antiviral activity was measured by syncytia reduction assay and confirmed by qPCR. PPs from Ecklonia arborea (formerly Eisenia arborea, Phaeophyceae) and Solieria filiformis (Rhodophyta) showed the highest Selectivity Index (SI), >3750 and >576.9 respectively. Both PPs extracts were selected to the subsequent experiments owing to their high efficacy and low cytotoxicity compared with ribavirin (SI of 11.57). The combinational effect of PPs with sulphated polysaccharides (SPs) and ribavirin were calculated by using Compusyn software. Synergistic activity was observed by combining both PPs with low concentrations of Solieria filiformis SPs (0.01 µg/mL). The antiviral activity of the best combinations was confirmed by qPCR.

Enoxaparin will be administered in both LMWH group and LMWH + steroid group at standard prophylactic dose (i.e., 4000 UI once day, increased to 6000 UI once day for patients weighting more than 90 kg). The treatment will be administered subcutaneously once a day up to ICU discharge. After ICU discharge it may be continued or interrupted in the destination ward up to clinical judgement of the attending physician. Methylprednisolone will be administered in both LMWH + steroid group and UHF + steroid group intravenously with an initial bolus of 0,5 mg/kg followed by administration of 0,5 mg/kg 4 times daily for 7 days, 0,5 mg/kg 3 times daily from day 8 to day 10, 0,5 mg/kg 2 times daily at days 11 and 12 and 0,5 mg/kg once daily at days 13 and 14. MAIN OUTCOMES: Primary Efficacy Endpoint: All-cause mortality at day 28 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: - Ventilation free days (VFDs) at day 28, defined as the total number of days that patient is alive and free of ventilation (either invasive or non-invasive) between randomization and day 28 (censored at hospital discharge). - Need of rescue administration of high-dose steroids or immune-modulatory drugs; - Occurrence of switch from non-invasive to invasive mechanical ventilation during ICU stay; - Delay from start of non-invasive ventilation to switch to invasive ventilation; - All-cause mortality at ICU discharge and hospital discharge; - ICU free days (IFDs) at day 28, defined as the total number of days between ICU discharge and day 28. - Occurrence of new infections from randomization to day 28; including infections by Candida, Aspergillus, Adenovirus, Herpes Virus e Cytomegalovirus - Occurrence of new organ dysfunction and grade of dysfunction during ICU stay. - Objectively confirmed venous thromboembolism, stroke or myocardial infarction; Safety endpoints: - Occurrence of major bleeding, defined as transfusion of 2 or more units of packed red blood cells in a day, bleeding that occurs in at least one of the following critical sites [intracranial, intra-spinal, intraocular (within the corpus of the eye; thus, a conjunctival bleed is not an intraocular bleed), pericardial, intra-articular, intramuscular with compartment syndrome, or retroperitoneal], bleeding that necessitates surgical intervention and bleeding that is fatal (defined as a bleeding event that was the primary cause of death or contributed directly to death); - Occurrence of clinically relevant non-major bleeding, defined ad acute clinically overt bleeding that does not meet the criteria for major and consists of any bleeding compromising hemodynamic; spontaneous hematoma larger than 25 cm2, intramuscular hematoma documented by ultrasonography, haematuria that was macroscopic and was spontaneous or lasted for more than 24 hours after invasive procedures; haemoptysis, hematemesis or spontaneous rectal bleeding requiring endoscopy or other medical intervention or any other bleeding requiring temporary cessation of a study drug. RANDOMIZATION: A block randomisation will be used with variable block sizes (block size 4-6-8), stratified by 3 factors: Centre, BMI (<30/&#8805;30) and Age (<75/&#8805;75). Central randomisation will be performed using a secure, web-based, randomisation system with an allocation ratio of 1:1:1. The allocation sequence will be generated by the study statistician using computer generated random numbers. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants to the study will be blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The target sample size is based on the hypothesis that the combined use of UHF and steroid versus the LMWH group will significantly reduce the risk of death at day 28. The overall sample size in this study is expected to be 210 with a randomization 1:1:1 and seventy patients in each group. Assuming an alpha of 2.5% (two tailed) and mortality rate in LMWH group of 50%, as indicated from initial studies of ICU patients, the study will have an 80% power to detect at least a 25 % absolute reduction in the risk of death between: a) LMHW + steroid group and LMWH group or b) UHF + steroid group and LMWH group. The study has not been sized to assess the difference between LMHW + steroid group and UHF + steroid group, therefore the results obtained from this comparison will need to be interpreted with caution and will need further adequately sized studies confirm the effect. On the basis of a conservative estimation, that 8 participating sites admit an average of 3 eligible patients per month per centre (24 patients/month). Assuming that 80 % of eligible patients are enrolled, recruitment of 210 participants will be completed in approximately 10 months. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version 1.1 of April 26th, 2020.

However, whether infected HCW acquire protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is unclear. Here, we characterized SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in Norwegian HCW in a prospective cohort study. METHODS: We enrolled 607 HCW pre- and post-the first COVID-19-pandemic wave. Exposure history, COVID-19-like symptoms and serum samples were collected. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were characterized by spike-protein IgG/IgM/IgA enzyme-linked immunosorbent and live-virus neutralization assays. RESULTS: Spike-specific IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies increased after the first pandemic wave in HCW with COVID-19-patient exposure, but not in HCW without patient exposure. Thirty-two HCW (5.3%) had spike-specific antibodies (11 seroconverted with &#8805;4-fold increase, 21 were seropositive at baseline). Neutralizing antibodies were found in 11 HCW that seroconverted, of whom 4 (36.4%) were asymptomatic. Ninety-seven HCW were tested by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during follow-up, 8 were positive (7 seroconverted and 1 had undetectable antibodies). CONCLUSIONS: We found increases in SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies in infected HCW, especially after COVID-19-patient exposure. Our data show a low number of SARS-CoV-2-seropositive HCW in a low prevalence setting, however, the proportion of seropositivity was higher than RT-PCR positivity, highlighting the importance of antibody testing.",2020,"Trieu, Mai-Chi; Bansal, Amit; Madsen, Anders; Zhou, Fan; Sævik, Marianne; Vahokoski, Juha; Brokstad, Karl Albert; Krammer, Florian; Tøndel, Camilla; Mohn, Kristin G I; Blomberg, Bjørn; Langeland, Nina; Cox, Rebecca J",,,#947657,,,,,227218799.0

In addition, the foreseeable shortage of supplies and an increasing flow of suspected and real cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and concerns of health professionals. METHOD: : The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. RESULTS: : Work-related stress is a potential cause of concern for health professionals. It has been associated with anxiety including multiple clinical activities, depression in the face of the coexistence of countless deaths, long work shifts with the most diverse unknowns and demands in the treatment with patients with COVID-19. Therefore, it is an important indicator of psychic exhaustion.

Without adequate access to healthy foods, weight maintenance can be hindered. OBJECTIVE: Examine influence degree of food access has on Appalachian bariatric surgery patient weight loss outcomes. SETTING: Appalachian University hospital, United States. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was used to examine the influence of food accessibility on weight loss outcomes in an Appalachian bariatric surgery patient population at a large tertiary hospital in West Virginia between 2013 and 2017. Demographic characteristics, health and family history, and 1-year surgery outcomes were collected. A state-specific food accessibility score was calculated for each patient address using the geographic information system. Patients were assigned a food access ranking score (FARS) between 0 (low food access) and 4 (high food access) based on criteria of quantity, quality, income, and vehicle access. RESULTS: Patients (n = 369) were predominately married (60.5%), white (92.4%), female (77.8%), and underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (75.9%), with a mean age of 45 years. Most patients had low FARS (M = 1.67 ± .73; 72.6%). Nonwhite patients (P = .03) with a preoperative diagnosis of depression (P = .02) or without a family history of obesity (P = .01) were found to be in the lower FARS categories. FARS was not indicative of weight loss post surgery (P > .05). CONCLUSIONS: Food accessibility in West Virginia was not associated with bariatric surgery weight outcomes at 1-year post operation. Lower food access was associated with nonwhite race/ethnicity, diagnosed depression at baseline, and no family history of obesity. Future studies should include more extended follow-up data collection and mixed-method approaches to capture perceptions of food access and its impact on the patients' postoperative journey.",2020,"Barr, M L; Tabone, L E; Brode, C; Szoka, N",Surg. obes. relat. dis,,#32830059,,,,,221279181.0

In this work, we introduce a new privacy-preserving and inclusive system for epidemic risk assessment and notification that aims to address the above limitations. Rather than capturing pairwise encounters between smartphones as done by existing apps, our system captures encounters between inexpensive, zero-maintenance, small devices carried by users, and beacons placed in strategic locations where infection clusters are most likely to originate. Epidemiological simulations using an agent-based model demonstrate several beneficial properties of our system. By achieving bidirectional interoperability with manual contact tracing, our system can help control disease spread already at low adoption. By utilizing the location and environmental information provided by the beacons, our system can provide significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than existing app-based systems.

Further, space constraints, violence, and overcrowding in slums make physical distancing and self-quarantine impractical, and the rapid spread of an infection highly likely. Residents of informal settlements are also economically vulnerable during any COVID-19 responses. Any responses to COVID-19 that do not recognize these realities will further jeopardize the survival of large segments of the urban population globally. Most top-down strategies to arrest an infectious disease will likely ignore the often-robust social groups and knowledge that already exist in many slums. Here, we offer a set of practice and policy suggestions that aim to (1) dampen the spread of COVID-19 based on the latest available science, (2) improve the likelihood of medical care for the urban poor whether or not they get infected, and (3) provide economic, social, and physical improvements and protections to the urban poor, including migrants, slum communities, and their residents, that can improve their long-term well-being. Immediate measures to protect residents of urban informal settlements, the homeless, those living in precarious settlements, and the entire population from COVID-19 include the following: (1) institute informal settlements/slum emergency planning committees in every urban informal settlement; (2) apply an immediate moratorium on evictions; (3) provide an immediate guarantee of payments to the poor; (4) immediately train and deploy community health workers; (5) immediately meet Sphere Humanitarian standards for water, sanitation, and hygiene; (6) provide immediate food assistance; (7) develop and implement a solid waste collection strategy; and (8) implement immediately a plan for mobility and health care. Lessons have been learned from earlier pandemics such as HIV and epidemics such as Ebola. They can be applied here.

However, most studies in this area have been based on laboratory experiments and retrospective surveys, rather than actual situations in which people are experiencing stress. Moreover, few studies have examined whether age moderates the benefits of gratitude. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused enormous psychological distress worldwide. Evidence-based strategies are needed to enhance well-being during this stressful time. This study attempted to fill these gaps by examining the benefits of feeling gratitude every day during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHOD: A sample of 231 participants from mainland China aged 18 to 85 years participated in a 14-day daily diary study. After a pretest to collect demographic data, information on gratitude, daily positive and negative affect, perceived stress related to COVID-19, and subjective health were measured using daily questionnaires on 14 consecutive days. One month after the daily diary period, information on affective experiences, life satisfaction, and subjective health was collected as a follow-up survey. RESULTS: On days when individuals feel more gratitude than usual, they report more positive affect, a lower level of perceived stress related to COVID-19, and better subjective health on the concurrent day (Day N). Individuals also report a lower level of stress related to COVID-19 on the following day (Day N+1), when they feel more gratitude than usual on Day N. Higher levels of gratitude across the 14-day study period was associated with a higher level of positive affect and a lower level of negative affect, but was not associated with life satisfaction or subjective health at the one-month follow-up assessment.

Objective To determine the effect of 16:8-hour time-restricted eating on weight loss and metabolic risk markers. Interventions Participants were randomized such that the consistent meal timing (CMT) group was instructed to eat 3 structured meals per day, and the time-restricted eating (TRE) group was instructed to eat ad libitum from 12:00 pm until 8:00 pm and completely abstain from caloric intake from 8:00 pm until 12:00 pm the following day. Design, Setting, and Participants This 12-week randomized clinical trial including men and women aged 18 to 64 years with a body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 27 to 43 was conducted on a custom mobile study application. Participants received a Bluetooth scale. Participants lived anywhere in the United States, with a subset of 50 participants living near San Francisco, California, who underwent in-person testing. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was weight loss. Secondary outcomes from the in-person cohort included changes in weight, fat mass, lean mass, fasting insulin, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c levels, estimated energy intake, total energy expenditure, and resting energy expenditure. Results Overall, 116 participants (mean [SD] age, 46.5 [10.5] years; 70 [60.3%] men) were included in the study. There was a significant decrease in weight in the TRE (-0.94 kg; 95% CI, -1.68 to -0.20; P = .01), but no significant change in the CMT group (-0.68 kg; 95% CI, -1.41 to 0.05, P = .07) or between groups (-0.26 kg; 95% CI, -1.30 to 0.78; P = .63). In the in-person cohort (n = 25 TRE, n = 25 CMT), there was a significant within-group decrease in weight in the TRE group (-1.70 kg; 95% CI, -2.56 to -0.83; P < .001). There was also a significant difference in appendicular lean mass index between groups (-0.16 kg/m2; 95% CI, -0.27 to -0.05; P = .005). There were no significant changes in any of the other secondary outcomes within or between groups. There were no differences in estimated energy intake between groups. Conclusions and Relevance Time-restricted eating, in the absence of other interventions, is not more effective in weight loss than eating throughout the day.

Targeted digital client communication is when the health system transmits information to particular individuals or groups of people, based on their health or demographic status. Common types of targeted client communication are text messages that remind people to go to appointments or take their medicines. Other types include phone calls, interactive voice response, or multimedia messages that offer healthcare information, advice, monitoring, and support. OBJECTIVES To explore clients' perceptions and experiences of targeted digital communication via mobile devices on topics related to reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, or adolescent health (RMNCAH). SEARCH METHODS We searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations (OvidSP), Embase (Ovid), World Health Organization Global Health Library, and POPLINE databases for eligible studies from inception to 3-6 July 2017 dependant on the database (See appendix 2). SELECTION CRITERIA We included studies that used qualitative methods for data collection and analysis; that explored clinets' perceptions and experiences of targeted digital communication via mobile device in the areas of RMNCAH; and were from any setting globally. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used maximum variation purposive sampling for data synthesis, employing a three-step sampling frame. We conducted a framework thematic analysis using the Supporting the Use of Research Evidence (SURE) framework as our starting point. We assessed our confidence in the findings using the GRADE-CERQual (Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approach. We used a matrix approach to explore whether potential implementation barriers identified in our synthesis had been addressed in the trials included in the related Cochrane Reviews of effectiveness. MAIN RESULTS We included 35 studies, from a wide range of countries on six continents. Nineteen studies were conducted in low- and middle-income settings and sixteen in high-income settings. Some of the studies explored the views of people who had experienced the interventions, whereas others were hypothetical in nature, asking what people felt they would like from a digital health intervention. The studies covered a range of digital targeted client communication, for example medication or appointment reminders, prenatal health information, support for smoking cessation while pregnant, or general sexual health information.Our synthesis showed that clients' experiences of these types of programmes were mixed. Some felt that these programmes provided them with feelings of support and connectedness, as they felt that someone was taking the time to send them messages (moderate confidence in the evidence). They also described sharing the messages with their friends and family (moderate confidence).However, clients also pointed to problems when using these programmes. Some clients had poor access to cell networks and to the internet (high confidence). Others had no phone, had lost or broken their phone, could not afford airtime, or had changed their phone number (moderate confidence). Some clients, particularly women and teenagers, had their access to phones controlled by others (moderate confidence). The cost of messages could also be a problem, and many thought that messages should be free of charge (high confidence). Language issues as well as skills in reading, writing, and using mobile phones could also be a problem (moderate confidence).Clients dealing with stigmatised or personal health conditions such as HIV, family planning, or abortion care were also concerned about privacy and confidentiality (high confidence). Some clients suggested strategies to deal with these issues, such as using neutral language and tailoring the content, timing, and frequency of messages (high confidence).Clients wanted messages at a time and frequency that was convenient for them (moderate confidence). They had preferences for different delivery channels (e.g. short message service (SMS) or interactive voice response) (moderate confidence). They also had preferences about message content, including new knowledge, reminders, solutions, and suggestions about health issues (moderate confidence). Clients' views about who sent the digital health communication could influence their views of the programme (moderate confidence).For an overview of the findings and our confidence in the evidence, please see the 'Summary of qualitative findings' tables.Our matrix shows that many of the trials assessing these types of programmes did not try to address the problems we identified, although this may have been a reporting issue. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Our synthesis identified several factors that can influence the successful implementation of targeted client communication programmes using mobile devices. These include barriers to use that have equity implications. Programme planners should take these factors into account when designing and implementing programmes. Future trial authors also need to actively address these factors and to report their efforts in their trial publications.",2019,"Ames, Heather Mr; Glenton, Claire; Lewin, Simon; Tamrat, Tigest; Akama, Eliud; Leon, Natalie",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608981/,204536726.0

A large number of chemical representations have been developed over the years, their numerosity being due to the fast development of computers and the complexity of producing a representation that encompasses all structural and chemical characteristics. We present here some of the most popular electronic molecular and macromolecular representations used in drug discovery, many of which are based on graph representations. Furthermore, we describe applications of these representations in AI-driven drug discovery. Our aim is to provide a brief guide on structural representations that are essential to the practice of AI in drug discovery.

Choices of preprocessing paths is crucial in scRNA-Seq data mining, because a proper preprocessing path can extract more important information from complex raw data and lead to more accurate clustering results. RESULTS: We proposed a method called NDRindex (Normalization and Dimensionality Reduction index) to evaluate data quality of outcomes of normalization and dimensionality reduction methods. The method includes a function to calculate the degree of data aggregation, which is the key to measuring data quality before clustering. For the five single-cell RNA sequence datasets we tested, the results proved the efficacy and accuracy of our index.

This study aimed to investigate the role of lipid rafts in the early stage of EV71 Infection. METHODS The effect of cholesterol depletion or addition of exogenous cholesterol was detected by immunofluorescence assays and quantitative real-time PCR. Effects of cholesterol depletion on the association of EV71 with lipid rafts were determined by flow cytometry and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Localization and internalization of EV71 and its receptor were assayed by confocal microscpoy and sucrose gradient analysis. The impact of cholesterol on the activation of phosphoinositide 3'-kinase/Akt signaling pathway during initial virus infection was analyzed by Western-blotting. RESULTS Disruption of membrane cholesterol by a pharmacological agent resulted in a significant reduction in the infectivity of EV71. The inhibitory effect could be reversed by the addition of exogenous cholesterol. Cholesterol depletion post-infection did not affect EV71 infection. While virus bound equally to cholesterol-depleted cells, EV71 particles failed to be internalized by cholesterol-depleted cells.

Step 1 Preoperative Assessment If the posterior tibial artery is not palpable, obtain an angiogram to determine the vascular supply distal to the traumatic zone and to prepare for conversion to a composite free microvascular transfer. Step 2 Remove Provisional Implants Remove provisional stabilization implants and minimize surgery about the knee. Step 3 Develop the Flap The dissection about the tarsal tunnel is the critical portion of the operative technique. Step 4 Contour the Calcaneus Any deviation from perpendicular will translate to an axial deformity in the reconstructed limb. Step 5 Prepare the Proximal Part of the Tibia and Surrounding Tissues Retain viable soft tissues and bone, but resect the fibula obliquely. Step 6 Secure the Calcaneus to the Tibia Avoid varus and recurvatum malalignment. Step 7 Repair and Reconstruct the Soft Tissues The injured limb is routinely very swollen, and in some cases complete coverage requires split-thickness skin-grafting. Step 8 Postoperative Care and Rehabilitation As the initial reconstruction is sometimes extremely bulbous, continually advise the patient that the shape will improve dramatically over time with shrinkage of the limb. Results In our original study, ten men and four women with a mean age of 43.2 years (range, twenty-four to sixty-four years) underwent an osteocutaneous pedicle flap transfer with use of the ipsilateral foot for salvage to achieve a transtibial amputation level.

The efficacy of electrostatic aerosol precipitation (EAP) and continuous aerosol evacuation (CAE) to eliminate bioaerosols during laparoscopic surgery was verified. METHODS: Ex-vivo laparoscopic cholecystectomies (LCs) were simulated +/- EAP or CAE in a pelvitrainer equipped with swine gallbladders. Release of bioaerosols was initiated by performing high-frequency electrosurgery with a monopolar electro hook (MP-HOOK) force at 40 W (MP-HOOK40) and 60 W (MP-HOOK60), as well as by ultrasonic cutting (USC). Particle number concentrations (PNC) of arising aerosols were analyzed with a condensation particle counter (CPC). Aerosol samples were taken i) within the pelvitrainer near to the source, ii) outside the pelvitrainer at the working trocar and iii) in the breathing zone of the surgeon. RESULTS: Within the pelvitrainer, MP-HOOK40 (6.4 x 10(5) cm(-3)) and MP-HOOK60 (7.3 x 10(5) cm(-3)) showed significant higher median PNCs compared to USC (4.4 x 10(5) cm(-3)) (p = 0.001). EAP lead to a significant decrease of the median PNCs in all three groups. A high linear correlation with Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.852, 0.825 and 0.759 were observed by comparing MP-HOOK40 (+/- EAP), MP-HOOK60 (+/- EAP) and USC (+/- EAP), respectively. During ex-vivo LC and CAE, significant bioaerosol contaminations of the operating room occurred. Ex-vivo LC with EAP lead to a considerable reduction of the bioaerosol concentration.

Infection with neurotropic strains JHM and A59 causes acute encephalitis, and in survivors, chronic demyelination, the latter of which serves as an animal model for multiple sclerosis. The MHV receptor is a carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule, CEACAM1a; paradoxically, CEACAM1a is poorly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to speculation of an additional receptor. Comparison of highly neurovirulent JHM isolates with less virulent variants and the weakly neurovirulent A59 strain, combined with the use of reverse genetics, has allowed mapping of pathogenic properties to individual viral genes. The spike protein, responsible for viral entry, is a major determinant of tropism and virulence. Other viral proteins, both structural and nonstructural, also contribute to pathogenesis in the CNS. Studies of host responses to MHV indicate that both innate and adaptive responses are crucial to antiviral defense. Type I interferon is essential to prevent very early mortality after infection. CD8 T cells, with the help of CD4 T cells, are crucial for viral clearance during acute disease and persist in the CNS during chronic disease. B cells are necessary to prevent reactivation of virus in the CNS following clearance of acute infection. Despite advances in understanding of coronavirus pathogenesis, questions remain regarding the mechanisms of viral entry and spread in cell types expressing low levels of receptor, as well as the unique interplay between virus and the host immune system during acute and chronic disease.",2010-04-06,"Bender, Susan J.; Weiss, Susan R.",J Neuroimmune Pharmacol,,,,document_parses/pdf_json/6d97d18fc999823cf462f2a10a9ec1b3ab7545ba.json,document_parses/pmc_json/PMC2914825.xml.json,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20369302/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11481-010-9202-2,25454740.0

Clinical signs occurred shortly after birth or started at an age of under 4 weeks and included apathy, dysphoric vocalization, hypermetric ataxia, intension tremor, head tilt, circling, proprioceptive deficits, seizures and ventral strabismus consistent with a diffuse intracranial lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a diffuse white matter disease without mass effect. Macroscopically, the cerebral white matter showed a gelatinous texture in the centrum semiovale. A mild hydrocephalus internus was noted. Histopathologically, a severe multifocal reduction of myelin formation and moderate diffuse edema without inflammation was detected leading to the diagnosis of leukodystrophy. Combined linkage analysis and homozygosity mapping in two related families delineated critical intervals of approximately 29 Mb. The comparison of whole genome sequence data of one affected Standard Schnauzer to 221 control genomes revealed a single private homozygous protein changing variant in the critical intervals, TSEN54:c.371G>A or p.(Gly124Asp). TSEN54 encodes the tRNA splicing endonuclease subunit 54. In humans, several variants in TSEN54 were reported to cause different types of pontocerebellar hypoplasia. The genotypes at the c.371G>A variant were perfectly associated with the leukodystrophy phenotype in 12 affected Standard Schnauzers and almost 1000 control dogs from different breeds. These results suggest that TSEN54:c.371G>A causes the leukodystrophy.

In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease. Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19. METHODS: An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. RESULTS: Nine studies with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD -31 × 109/L; 95% CI, from -35 to -29 × 109/L).

Here, we report a comprehensive computational approach to identify the multi-targeted drug molecules against the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, whichare crucially involved in the viral–host interaction, replication of the virus inside the host, disease progression and transmission of coronavirus infection. Virtual screening of 75 FDA-approved potential antiviral drugs against the target proteins, spike (S) glycoprotein, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CL(pro)), cathepsin L (CTSL), nucleocapsid protein, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and non-structural protein 6 (NSP6), resulted in the selection of seven drugs which preferentially bind to the target proteins. Further, the molecular interactions determined by molecular dynamics simulation revealed that among the 75 drug molecules, catechin can effectively bind to 3CL(pro), CTSL, RBD of S protein, NSP6 and nucleocapsid protein. It is more conveniently involved in key molecular interactions, showing binding free energy (ΔG(bind)) in the range of −5.09 kcal/mol (CTSL) to −26.09 kcal/mol (NSP6). At the binding pocket, catechin is majorly stabilized by the hydrophobic interactions, displays ΔE(vdW) values: −7.59 to −37.39 kcal/mol.

If a gastric tube can be guided into the esophagus under direct vision with a video laryngoscope, misplacement of the gastric tube into the trachea can be avoided. We compared gastric tube insertion under direct vision using a video laryngoscope with the conventional method of blind insertion. METHODS We enrolled 60 patients who required a transnasal gastric tube to facilitate elective abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. The participants were recruited consecutively into one of two groups, a group of 30 patients in whom a gastric tube was inserted using a King Vision™ video laryngoscope (KV group), and a group of 30 patients who underwent conventional blind insertion of the gastric tube (Blind group). The success rate, the time taken to insert the gastric tube, and the incidence of complications were compared. RESULTS In the KV group, the time required for gastric tube placement was 52.5 ± 17.1 seconds, with a success rate of 100%. Slight oral hemorrhage occurred in two participants and slight epistaxis in one participant. In the Blind group, the time required for gastric tube placement was 65.9 ± 39.9 seconds, with a success rate of 90% (27 out of 30 patients). Slight oral hemorrhage occurred in two participants, slight epistaxis occurred in two participants, and tracheal malposition occurred in one participant but was detected promptly and corrected using the video laryngoscope. There were no significant differences in the time required for placing the gastric tube, the success rate, or the incidence of complications between the groups.

The existing literature is limited. Objective(s) To develop a robust, reliable and valid methodology to evaluate distribution and persistence of dental aerosol and splatter, including the evaluation of clinical procedures. Methods Fluorescein was introduced into the irrigation reservoirs of a high-speed air-turbine, ultrasonic scaler and 3-in-1 spray and procedures performed on a mannequin in triplicate. Filter papers were placed in the immediate environment. The impact of dental suction and assistant presence were also evaluated. Samples were analysed using photographic image analysis, and spectrofluorometric analysis. Descriptive statistics were calculated and Pearson’s correlation for comparison of analytic methods. Results All procedures were aerosol and splatter generating. Contamination was highest closest to the source, remaining high to 1-1.5 m. Contamination was detectable at the maximum distance measured (4 m) for high-speed air-turbine with maximum relative fluorescence units (RFU) being: 46,091 at 0.5 m, 3,541 at 1.0 m, and 1,695 at 4 m.

The genome has a length of ~29.9 kbps, which encodes for genes that are essential for cell survival and replication. Different evolutionary constraints constantly influence the codon usage bias (CUB) of different genes. A virus optimizes its codon usage to fit the host environment on which it savors. This study is a comprehensive analysis of the CUB for the different genes encoded by viruses of the Coronaviridae family. Different methods including relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), an Effective number of codons (ENc), parity plot 2, and Neutrality plot, were adopted to analyze the factors responsible for the genetic evolution of the Coronaviridae family. Base composition and RSCU analyses demonstrated the presence of A-ended and U-ended codons being preferred in the 3rd codon position and are suggestive of mutational selection. The lesser ENc value for the spike 'S' gene suggests a higher bias in the codon usage of this gene compared to the other structural genes. Parity plot 2 and neutrality plot analyses demonstrate the role and the extent of mutational and natural selection towards the codon usage pattern. It was observed that the structural genes of the Coronaviridae family analyzed in this study were at the least under 84% influence of natural selection, implying a major role of natural selection in shaping the codon usage.",2020,"Nyayanit, Dimpal A; Yadav, Pragya D; Kharde, Rutuja; Cherian, Sarah",Viruses,,#1025054,,,,,229720041.0

The data of several studies suggest that various electrolyte imbalances seem to be having impact on disease prognosis. However, no study in literature primarily focused on baseline electrolyte abnormalities' effect on disease outcome. In this study, we assessed the validity of the hypothesis: ""The baseline electrolyte imbalances may be related to unfavourable outcomes in the hospitalized COVID-19 patients"". Material-Methods: Design of the study was retrospective and observational. We included 408 hospitalized COVID-19 patients over 18 years old. Baseline levels of sodium, potassium, calcium and chloride were assessed. We evaluated the effect of those electrolytes' abnormalities on intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation requirement, hospitalization duration and treatment outcome. Also, we clustered the patients based upon electrolyte levels. Thereafter, we compared the clusters according to outcome variables and then, we compared the frequency of other severe disease indices between the clusters. Lastly, we evaluated the independent factors related to COVID -19 associated deaths with multivariate analyse. Results: 228 (55.8%) of the patients had at least one electrolyte imbalances at baseline. Hyponatremia was the most frequent electrolyte abnormality. Patients with hyponatremia, hypochloride or hypocalcemia respectively would have more frequent requirement of intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation; higher mortality rate and longer hospitalization. Moreover, the cluster associated with electrolyte abnormalities had unfavourable outcome. Also, clinical and laboratory features associated with severe disease were detected more often in those cluster. Furthermore, hyponatremia was found as one of the independent factors related to death from COVID-19 (OR 10.33; CI %95 1.62-65.62; p=0.01). Conclusion: Baseline electrolyte imbalances, primarily hyponatremia would be related to poor prognosis in COVID-19 and baseline electrolyte assessment would be beneficial for evaluating the risk of severe COVID-19.",2020,"Tezcan, Mehmet Engin; Dogan Gokce, Gizem; Sen, Nesrin; Zorlutuna Kaymak, Nilufer; Ozer, Rasit Serdar",New Microbes New Infect,,#739037,,,,,221406042.0

There have been recommendations to discontinue these medications, which are essential in the treatment of several chronic disease conditions, while, in the absence of clinical evidence, professional societies have advocated their continued use. Objective: To study the association between use of ACEIs/ARBs with the likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19 and to study outcome data in subsets of patients taking ACEIs/ARBs who tested positive with severity of clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (eg, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and requirement for mechanical ventilation). Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study with overlap propensity score weighting was conducted at the Cleveland Clinic Health System in Ohio and Florida. All patients tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and April 12, 2020, were included. Exposures: History of taking ACEIs or ARBs at the time of COVID-19 testing. Main Outcomes and Measures: Results of COVID-19 testing in the entire cohort, number of patients requiring hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions, and mechanical ventilation among those who tested positive. Results: A total of 18â¯472 patients tested for COVID-19. The mean (SD) age was 49 (21) years, 7384 (40%) were male, and 12â¯725 (69%) were white. Of 18â¯472 patients who underwent COVID-19 testing, 2285 (12.4%) were taking either ACEIs or ARBs. A positive COVID-19 test result was observed in 1735 of 18â¯472 patients (9.4%). Among patients who tested positive, 421 (24.3%) were admitted to the hospital, 161 (9.3%) were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 111 (6.4%) required mechanical ventilation. Overlap propensity score weighting showed no significant association of ACEI and/or ARB use with COVID-19 test positivity (overlap propensity score-weighted odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81-1.15). Conclusions and Relevance: This study found no association between ACEI or ARB use and COVID-19 test positivity.

This study aims to assess the diagnostic performance of CXR, with emphasis on its predictive value, for severe COVID-19 disease. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted, 358 chest radiographs were performed on 109 COVID-19 patients (median age 44.4 years, 58 males and 30 with comorbidities) admitted between 22 January 2020 and 15 March 2020. Each CXR was reviewed and scored by three radiologists in consensus using a 72-point COVID-19 Radiographic Score (CRS). Disease severity was determined by the need for supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation. Results Patients who needed supplemental oxygen (n=19, 17.4%) were significantly older (P<0.001) and significantly more of them had co-morbidities (P=0.011). They also had higher C-reactive protein (CRP) (P<0.001), higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P<0.001), lower lymphocyte count (P<0.001) and lower hemoglobin (Hb) (P=0.001). Their initial (CRSinitial) and maximal CRS (CRSmax) were higher (P<0.001). Adjusting for age and baseline hemoglobin, the AUROC of CRSmax (0.983) was as high as CRPmax (0.987) and higher than the AUROC for lymphocyte countmin (0.897), and LDHmax (0.900). The AUROC for CRSinitial was slightly lower (0.930). CRSinitial ≥5 had a sensitivity of 63% and specificity of 92% in predicting the need for oxygen, and 73% sensitivity and 88% specificity in predicting the need for mechanical ventilation. CRS between the 6th and 10th day from the onset of symptoms (CRSD6-10) ≥5 had a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 95% in predicting the need for oxygen, and 100% sensitivity and 86% specificity in predicting the need for mechanical ventilation. Conclusions Adjusting for key confounders of age and baseline Hb, CRSmax performed comparable to or better than laboratory markers in the diagnosis of severe disease.

Our objective was to determine differences in drug deposition based on different nebulizer positions in the ventilator circuit, using a vibrating mesh nebulizer. METHODS An 8.0-mm inner diameter endotracheal tube (ETT) was connected to a training test lung, compliance of 30 mL/cm H2O, with a collecting filter placed at the ETT-test lung junction. A mechanical ventilator, heated wire circuit, and pass-over humidifier were utilized. A syringe pump continuously instilled a 15,000-ng/mL epoprostenol solution at 30, 50, and 70 ng/kg/min into the vibrating mesh nebulizer at all 4 positions. Tidal volumes (VT) were set at 4, 6, and 8 mL/kg for a 70-kg patient with breathing frequencies of 25, 16, and 12 breaths/min, respectively.

However, its benefit or harm while treating COVID-19 is not fully studied. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to assess the rationality on the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19. Pubmed, Medline, Clinicaltrials.gov, Cochrane library, and Preprint publisher were searched. In the qualitative syntheses, 41, and quantitative studies, 40, were included using PRISMA guidelines. Assessment of heterogeneity was done using the I-squared (I(2)) test and random/fixed effect analysis was done to determine the odds/risk ratio. We found severely ill COVID-19 patients almost 5 (OR 4.78, 2.76–8.26) times higher odds of getting corticosteroids during their treatment. Similarly, the odds for corticosteroids in addition to standard of care (SOC) were approximately 4 (OR 4.09, 1.89–8.84) times higher among intensive care unit (ICU) patients than non-ICU ones. A higher mortality risk with the corticosteroid-receiving group compared with the SOC alone (RR 2.01, 1.12–3.63) was observed. Neither increased discharge rate (RR 0.79, 0.63–0.99) nor recovery/improvement rate was shown among the corticosteroid-receiving group (OR 0.24, 0.13–0.43). Approximately, the overall 4-day longer hospital stay was found among the treatment groups (MD 4.19, 2.57–5.81). For the negative conversion of reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), approximately a 3-day (MD 2.42, 1.31–3.53) delay was observed with corticosteroid treatment cases. Our study concludes that more severe and critically ill patients tend to get corticosteroids, and the mortality risk increases with the use of corticosteroids. With the use of corticosteroids, delayed recovery and a longer hospital stay were observed.

In the light of its rapid global spreading, on 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization has declared it a pandemic. Interestingly, the global spreading of the disease is not uniform, but has so far left some countries relatively less affected. The reason(s) for this anomalous behavior are not fully understood, but distinct hypotheses have been proposed. Here we discuss the plausibility of two of them: the universal vaccination with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and the widespread use of the antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ). Both have been amply discussed in the recent literature with positive and negative conclusions: we felt that a comprehensive presentation of the data available on them would be useful. The analysis of data for countries with over 1000 reported COVID-19 cases has shown that the incidence and mortality were higher in countries in which BCG vaccination is either absent or has been discontinued, as compared with the countries with universal vaccination. We have performed a similar analysis of the data available for CQ, a widely used drug in the African continent and in other countries in which malaria is endemic; we discuss it here because CQ has been used as the drug to treat COVID-19 patients. Several African countries no longer recommend it officially for the fight against malaria, due to the development of resistance to Plasmodium, but its use across the continent is still diffuse. Taken together, the data in the literature have led to the suggestion of a possible inverse correlation between BCG immunization and COVID-19 disease incidence and severity.",2020,"Sharma, Abhibhav; Kumar Sharma, Saurabh; Shi, Yufang; Bucci, Enrico; Carafoli, Ernesto; Melino, Gerry; Bhattacherjee, Arnab; Das, Gobardhan",Cell Death Dis,,#638449,,,,,220417751.0

Panic buying is identified as one such side effect. Among various models and measures undertaken by government to manage the pandemic, timed-intervention policy is commonly practiced by most countries. This paper examines the timing effect between government measures and panic buying. Three studies were undertaken to understand the timing effect and identify a connection between timed measures and consumer behaviours. Semantic analysis, secondary data search, and big data analytics were deployed to address the research aim. Although claiming a causal relationship is cautioned, the findings reveal a connection between timing of government measures and panic buying.

At the same time the security of lines of communications has become the highest priority, especially that a possibility of terrorist attacks still poses a serious threat. Although terrorism has been being fought intensively since 11th September, terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaeda or Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, are still able to attack. The article considers the threat of organizing a terrorist attack posed by Foreign Terrorist Fighters returning home to the Baltic countries. Due to the fairly high number of Foreign Terrorist Fighters in some countries around the Baltic Sea, very intense passenger traffic in the area, and the appeals which have been proclaimed by Al-Qaeda and Islamic State leaders, there is a possibility of a terrorist attack occurrence in the near future.

The ability to predict residues of the RdRp required for faithful incorporation of nucleotides represents an essential step in any pipeline intended to exploit perturbed fidelity as the basis for rational design of vaccine candidates. We used x-ray crystallography, molecular dynamics simulations, NMR spectroscopy, and pre-steady-state kinetics to compare a mutator (H273R) RdRp from poliovirus to the wild-type (WT) enzyme. We show that the nucleotide-binding site toggles between the nucleotide binding-occluded and nucleotide binding-competent states. The conformational dynamics between these states were enhanced by binding to primed template RNA. For the WT, the occluded conformation was favored; for H273R, the competent conformation was favored. The resonance for Met-187 in our NMR spectra reported on the ability of the enzyme to check the correctness of the bound nucleotide. Kinetic experiments were consistent with the conformational dynamics contributing to the established pre-incorporation conformational change and fidelity checkpoint. For H273R, residues comprising the active site spent more time in the catalytically competent conformation and were more positively correlated than the WT. We propose that by linking the equilibrium between the binding-occluded and binding-competent conformations of the nucleotide-binding pocket and other active-site dynamics to the correctness of the bound nucleotide, faithful nucleotide incorporation is achieved.

STUDY DESIGN Prospective observational study. METHODS We constructed a transoral robotic surgery (TORS) simulator using porcine tongue in a modified airway mannequin. Twenty-nine surgeons performed transoral robotic posterior hemiglossectomy on the simulator. The 20 resident subjects completed six trials each, and the five fellows and four attending surgeons completed two trials each. In addition to instrument vibrations, surgical video was recorded for each trial and was blindly rated using the Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skill (GEARS), a validated instrument for assessing robotic surgical skill. RESULTS Attending surgeons were faster (P = .004) and demonstrated greater technical skill than fellows or residents (P < .001). Resident completion time generally decreased over the study, becoming significantly faster by the fifth trial (P = .02). A similar trend was seen in resident GEARS scores, which generally increased and were significantly improved by the fourth trial (P = .008). Instrument vibrations were not significantly different between subject groups. Finally, subjects highly rated the realism and training value of the TORS simulator (mean 4.4 and 4.7 out of 5, respectively). CONCLUSIONS The reported findings support using the described simulator as a training tool for TORS. Residents significantly improved in speed and technical skill over the course of six trials but did not achieve the performance levels of attending surgeons.

This review outlines the current evidence of the epidemiology of infection in children, the clinical manifestations of disease, the role of children in transmission of the virus and the recently described hyperinflammatory syndrome observed later during the first phase of the pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS International seroprevalence studies have found younger children to have lower prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, indicating they have not been infected as much as adults. This may be due to shielding by school closures, or by a reduced susceptibility to infection, as indicated by a significantly lower attack rate in children than adults in household contact tracing studies. The most well recognized symptoms in adults of cough, fever, anosmia and ageusia are less frequent in children, who may often present with mild and nonspecific symptoms, or with gastrointestinal symptoms alone. Risk factors for severe disease in children include chronic lung, cardiac or neurological disease, and malignancy. However, the absolute risk still appears very low for these cohorts. A new hyperinflammatory syndrome has emerged with an apparent immune cause.

Here, we aim to describe the characteristics of COVID-19 patients at disease onset, with special focus on the diagnosis and management of female patients with COVID-19. Methods: We explored the unstructured free text in the electronic health records (EHRs) within the SESCAM Healthcare Network (Castilla La-Mancha, Spain). The study sample comprised the entire population with available EHRs (1,446,452 patients) from January 1st to May 1st, 2020. We extracted patients' clinical information upon diagnosis, progression, and outcome for all COVID-19 cases. Results: A total of 4,780 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were identified. Of these, 2,443 (51%) were female, who were on average 1.5 years younger than male patients (61.7 ± 19.4 vs. 63.3 ± 18.3, p = 0.0025). There were more female COVID-19 cases in the 15-59-year-old interval, with the greatest sex ratio (95% confidence interval) observed in the 30-39-year-old range (1.69; 1.35-2.11). Upon diagnosis, headache, anosmia, and ageusia were significantly more frequent in females than males. Imaging by chest X-ray or blood tests were performed less frequently in females (65.5% vs. 78.3% and 49.5% vs. 63.7%, respectively), all p < 0.001. Regarding hospital resource use, females showed less frequency of hospitalization (44.3% vs. 62.0%) and intensive care unit admission (2.8% vs. 6.3%) than males, all p < 0.001.

Of concern, neurological injury in this group remains poorly defined. Among high-risk and inoperable patients, subclinical injury is reported on average in 75% undergoing the procedure. Although this attendant risk may be acceptable in higher-risk patients, it may not be so in those of lower risk. METHODS AND RESULTS Forty patients undergoing TAVI with the Edwards SAPIEN-XT™ prosthesis were prospectively studied. Patients were of intermediate surgical risk, with a mean±standard deviation Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 5.1±2.5% and a EuroSCORE II of 4.8±2.4%; participant age was 82±7 years. Clinically apparent injury was assessed by serial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale assessments, Montreal Cognitive Assessments (MoCA), and with the Confusion Assessment Method. These identified 1 (2.5%) minor stroke, 1 (2.5%) episode of postoperative delirium, and 2 patients (5%) with significant postoperative cognitive dysfunction. Subclinical neurological injury was assessed using brain magnetic resonance imaging, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences preprocedure and at 3±1 days postprocedure. This identified 68 new DWI lesions present in 60% of participants, with a median±interquartile range of 1±3 lesions/patient and volumes of infarction of 24±19 μL/lesion and 89±218 μL/patient. DWI lesions were associated with a statistically significant reduction in early cognition (mean ΔMoCA -3.5±1.7) without effect on cognition, quality of life, or functional capacity at 6 months. CONCLUSIONS Objectively measured subclinical neurological injuries remain a concern in intermediate-risk patients undergoing TAVI and are likely to manifest with early neurocognitive changes.

Objectives As expected, this impacts vascular trainees and their training and so, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact o COVID-19 pandemic on vascular education. Materials and Methods A remote digital survey was spread across European networks aiming vascular residents and their activities during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. Questions were related to possible trainee relocations, COVID-19 infections, daily activities reduction, scientific activity, exams and internships. Results reported here are from 7th July to 20th September. Duplicate responses were removed. Results A total of 104 answers across 27 countries were included. The mean age of the trainee's responders were 31.2 ± 3.58 years old, 63% were male and the residency year mode was the 5th. Forty-four (42.3%) of the trainees stood in the COVID- 19 frontline, of which were mainly for COVID-19 wards (50%) and emergency departments (22.1%), with only two (1.9%) being relocated to a different hospital. Concerning time in the frontline, the most frequent answers were up to two weeks in 34.8% and above 12 weeks in 28.8%. More than half (76.9%) said to had suffer a decrease in number of surgical procedures performed and/or assisted with over 60% reporting a decrease superior to 50%.

The fact that the technology exists for analyzing genetic material in exquisite detail and constructing DNA in virtually any desired form was the basis for promising rapid translation into clinical medicine and the final cure for genetically determined diseases; cystic fibrosis is the prime example of such a lung disease. The promise was not kept, at least not in a time frame which was expected. That result is neither because the rationale was faulty nor because the tools of molecular biology were wanting. The devil was and is in the details. How do you deliver DNA to the desired cell targets in amounts sufficient to accomplish the desired effect? Viral vectors have received the most attention, but viral vectors have proven to have both theoretical and practical problems. In the lungs, these vectors have not fulfilled their original promise. Non-viral based strategies work in a general sense, but efficiency of gene delivery in vivo has been a limitation. In addition, the experimental end points in both clinical and preclinical investigation have been most often designed to demonstrate phenomenology rather than potential efficacy. And, why limit the potential of gene therapy to inherited disease? In fact, treatment of acquired diseases by increasing or decreasing expression of a given gene in the lungs that would hasten recovery from an acquired disease might be easier than treating inherited disease because the requirements for duration of transgene expression would be less stringent. Over the past two decades, we have learned enough about the pathogenesis of acute lung injury to predict that increased (or decreased) production of certain biologically active mediators should be beneficial. Genes encoding some of these mediators have been cloned and constructs made which express the genes. It is now possible using either viral or non-viral strategies to deliver expression constructs to the lungs and, since acute lung injury has a dismal prognosis and no effective drugs have been identified, this seems a good clinical target for gene therapy. In preclinical studies, we have shown that increased expression of the gene encoding the constitutive form of the cyclooxygenase gene (COX-1) results in increased production of prostacyclin and PGE(2) by the lungs and inhibits endotoxin induced pulmonary hypertension and edema. Additional studies demonstrate that increased expression of the alpha-1 antitrypsin gene in human respiratory epithelium in culture and in vivo has anti-viral and anti-inflammatory effects that are not predicted by extracellular concentrations of the transgene product. Thus, acute lung injury is a reasonable target for gene therapy, and evidence to date indicates that current technology is sufficiently robust to pursue this novel area for treatment of this devastating disease.",2000,"Brigham, K.

METHODS: A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was conducted in HCP working in public hospitals in Hong Kong. The DCE was designed to examine the relative importance of vaccine characteristics (vaccine efficacy and safety), social normative influence reflected by the proportion of HCP colleagues intending to take SIV, and convenience in access to vaccine indicated by vaccination programme duration, vaccination location, vaccination arrangement procedure and service hours in determining influenza vaccination choice among HCP. Mixed logit regression modelling was conducted to examine the preference weight (β) of factors included in the DCE for determining vaccination choice. RESULTS: Vaccination probability increased with increase in vaccine efficacy (β = 0.02 for per 1% increase), vaccination location changing from “designated staff clinic” to “mobile station” (β = 0.37), vaccination arrangement procedure changing from “by appointment” to “by walk-in” (β = 0.99), but decreased with the increase in probability of mild reactions to vaccination (β = −0.05 for per 1% increase). CONCLUSION: Vaccine safety was judged to be more important than vaccine efficacy for determining vaccination choice.

Apart from being essential proteins for various organisms living in sub-zero temperatures, AFPs have numerous applications in different industries. They possess very small resemblance to each other and cannot be easily identified using simple search algorithms such as BLAST and PSI-BLAST. Diverse AFPs found in fishes (Type I, II, III, IV and antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs)), are sub-types and show low sequence and structural similarity, making their accurate prediction challenging. Although several machine-learning methods have been proposed for the classification of AFPs, prediction methods that have greater reliability are required. In this paper, we propose a novel machine-learning-based approach for the prediction of AFP sequences using latent space learning through a deep auto-encoder method. For latent space pruning, we use the output of the auto-encoder with a deep neural network classifier to learn the non-linear mapping of the protein sequence descriptor and class label. The proposed method outperformed the existing methods, yielding excellent results in comparison. A comprehensive ablation study is performed, and the proposed method is evaluated in terms of widely used performance measures.

The results of the RF model indicated that TDN and AH (absolute humidity) influence the COVID-19 cases most. In the Dhaka division, MRH is the most vital meteorological factor that affects COVID-19 deaths. This study indicates the humidity and rainfall are crucial factors affecting the COVID-19 case, which is contrary to many previous studies in other countries.

However, the lymphatic network of gastric cancer may be more complex, and it may be difficult to visualize all the SN distributed in unexpected areas by conventional modalities. In this study, we evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of CT lymphography for the detection of SN in gastric cancer. A total 24 patients with early gastric cancer were enrolled in the study. Three modalities (CT lymphography, dye and radioisotope [RI] methods) were used for the detection of SN. The images of CT lymphography were obtained at 10 min after injection of contrast agents. The SN were successfully identified by CT lymphography in 83.3% of patients; detection rates by the dye and RI methods were 95% and 100%, respectively. Most patients, in whom SN were successfully detected by CT lymphography, had positive results at 5 min after injection of the contrast material. The SN stations detected by CT lymphography were consistent with or included those detected by dye and/or RI methods. In conclusion, CT lymphography for the detection of SN in gastric cancer is feasible and has several advantages.

Understanding the SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of infection is crucial in the development of potential therapeutics and vaccines. The infection process is triggered by direct binding of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) to the host cell receptor, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Many efforts have been made to design or repurpose therapeutics to deactivate RBD or ACE2 and prevent the initial binding. In addition to direct inhibition strategies, small chemical compounds might be able to interfere and destabilize the meta-stable, pre-fusion complex of ACE2-RBD. This approach can be employed to prevent the further progress of virus infection at its early stages. In this study, Molecular docking is employed to analyze the binding of two chemical compounds, SSAA09E2 and Nilotinib, with the druggable pocket of the ACE2-RBD complex. The structural changes as a result of the interference with the ACE2-RBD complex are analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations. Results show that both Nilotinib and SSAA09E2 can induce significant conformational changes in the ACE2-RBD complex, intervene with the hydrogen bonds, and influence the flexibility of proteins. Moreover, essential dynamics analysis suggests that the presence of small molecules can trigger large-scale conformational changes that may destabilize the ACE2-RBD complex.",2020-12-16,"Razizadeh, Meghdad; Nikfar, Mehdi; Liu, Yaling",ChemRxiv : the preprint server for chemistry,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.13377119.v1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33469570/,231653655.0

203796,8mm6pg8c,,WHO,Cardiac MRI in Pulmonary Hypertension: From Magnet to Bedside,,,,unk,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a disease characterized by progressive rise of pulmonary artery (PA) pressure, which can lead to right ventricular (RV) failure. It is usually diagnosed late because of the nonspecificity of its symptoms. RV performance and adaptation to an increased afterload, reflecting the interaction of the PA and RV as a morphofunctional unit, constitute a critical determinant of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Therefore, early detection of dysfunction may prevent treatment failure. Cardiac MRI constitutes one of the most complete diagnostic modalities for diagnosing PH. It allows evaluation of the morphology and hemodynamics of the PA and RV. Several cine steady-state free-precession (SSFP)-derived parameters (indexed RV end-diastolic volume or RV systolic volume) and phase-contrast regional area change have been suggested as powerful biomarkers for prognosis and treatment. Recently, new cardiac MRI sequences have been added to clinical protocols for PH evaluation, providing brand-new information. Strain analysis with myocardial feature tracking can help detect early RV dysfunction, even with preserved ejection fraction. Four-dimensional flow cardiac MRI can enhance assessment of advanced RV and PA hemodynamics. Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging may allow detection of replacement fibrosis in PH patients, which is associated with poor outcome. T1 mapping may help detect interstitial fibrosis, even with normal LGE imaging results. The authors analyze the imaging workup of PH with a focus on the role of morphologic and functional cardiac MRI in diagnosis and management of PH, including some of the newer techniques.

In this study we compare the characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 patients who are and who are not healthcare workers (HCW). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 2,842 adult patients with known HCW status and a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test presenting to a large academic medical center emergency department (ED) in New York State from March 21 2020 through June 2020.

The centers and institutions that deal with the diagnosis and intervention of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) require rapid functional adaptation to respond to patients’ needs. The possibility of using technology to activate and manage diagnostic (preliminary diagnosis) and intervention processes should be explored. Two developed telemedicine working models for diagnosis and intervention, including synchronous and asynchronous transmissions, are presented. They are proposals not yet supported by the data. The diagnosis step is composed by two different and consecutives phases: (A) pre-specialistic consultation (PSC) and (B) specialistic assessment. The intervention step implemented well-recognized evidence-based models for preschoolers, school-aged, and older children in an online format. Parents’ support is also included.

CASE PRESENTATION: On 14 May, two dead bodies (i.e., a 30-years old Indian woman and her six-month-old baby) were found in a Riyadh apartment complex. The perpetrator (a person who kills the others and later commits suicide) – a trained nurse, was in search of a job. The woman's husband was recently retrenched from his technician job at a company in Madinah Airport. Her husband was admitted to a hospital with symptoms related to the COVID-19 infection four days before the suicide incidence. The 70-year-old mother-in-law alerted the neighbors after finding that the apartment is locked from inside and there was no response on knocking the doors. After this, the neighbors gathered and called the police. Police found two dead-bodies after opening the flat and suspected that the child was killed before the woman committed suicide. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the present findings, further child filicide-suicide possibilities in families with economically distressed and/or positive COVID-19 status are expected.

The initial PCE dropped to 10.20 % after two days because of severe migration of O and Ag at the MoOX/Ag interface. We solved this by the insertion of a CrOX layer between the MoOX layer and the Ag electrode.

The reliability of biochemical data derived from these measurements is dependent on the quality of the sample collection and exact preparation and analysis protocols. Here, we describe systematically, the impact of variations in sample collection and preparation on information recovery from quantitative proton ((1)H) NMR spectroscopy of human blood plasma and serum. The effects of variation of blood collection tube sizes and preservatives, successive freeze–thaw cycles, sample storage at −80 °C, and short-term storage at 4 and 20 °C on the quantitative lipoprotein and metabolite patterns were investigated. Storage of plasma samples at 4 °C for up to 48 h, freezing at −80 °C and blood sample collection tube choice have few and minor effects on quantitative lipoprotein profiles, and even storage at 4 °C for up to 168 h caused little information loss. In contrast, the impact of heat-treatment (56 °C for 30 min), which has been used for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses, that may be required prior to analytical measurements in low level biosecurity facilities induced marked changes in both lipoprotein and low molecular weight metabolite profiles. It was conclusively demonstrated that this heat inactivation procedure degrades lipoproteins and changes metabolic information in complex ways. Plasma from control individuals and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are differentially altered resulting in the creation of artifactual pseudo-biomarkers and destruction of real biomarkers to the extent that data from heat-treated samples are largely uninterpretable.

168049,p01c04h7,,WHO,"How to strengthen a health research system: WHO's review, whose literature and who is providing leadership?",,,,unk,"BACKGROUND: Health research is important for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. However, there are many challenges facing health research, including securing sufficient funds, building capacity, producing research findings and using both local and global evidence, and avoiding waste. A WHO initiative addressed these challenges by developing a conceptual framework with four functions to guide the development of national health research systems. Despite some progress, more is needed before health research systems can meet their full potential of improving health systems. The WHO Regional Office for Europe commissioned an evidence synthesis of the systems-level literature. This Opinion piece considers its findings before reflecting on the vast additional literature available on the range of specific health research system functions related to the various challenges. Finally, it considers who should lead research system strengthening. MAIN TEXT: The evidence synthesis identifies two main approaches for strengthening national health research systems, namely implementing comprehensive and coherent strategies and participation in partnerships. The literature describing these approaches at the systems level also provides data on ways to strengthen each of the four functions of governance, securing financing, capacity-building, and production and use of research. Countries effectively implementing strategies include England, Ireland and Rwanda, whereas West Africa experienced effective partnerships. Recommended policy approaches for system strengthening are context specific. The vast literature on each function and the ever-growing evidence-base are illustrated by considering papers in just one key journal, Health Research Policy and Systems, and analysing the contribution of two national studies. A review of the functions of the Iranian system identifies over 200 relevant and mostly national records; an analysis of the creation of the English National Institute for Health Research describes the key leadership role played by the health department. Furthermore, WHO is playing leadership roles in helping coordinate partnerships within and across health research systems that have been attempting to tackle the COVID-19 crisis. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence synthesis provides a firm basis for decision-making by policy-makers and research leaders looking to strengthen national health research systems within their own national context. It identifies five crucial policy approaches - conducting situation analysis, sustaining a comprehensive strategy, engaging stakeholders, evaluating impacts on health systems, and partnership participation. The vast and ever-growing additional literature could provide further perspectives, including on crucial leadership roles for health ministries.",2020,"Hanney, Stephen R; Kanya, Lucy; Pokhrel, Subhash; Jones, Teresa H; Boaz, Annette",Health Res Policy Syst,,#610727,,,,,219976546.0

Previously treatable bacterial infections now require the last line of antibiotics or are untreatable. The current antibiotic of last resort for carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections is often colistin. Evidence for the shifting pattern of colistin resistance and how the international community should respond are discussed in this review. METHODS The literature on colistin resistance was reviewed. RESULTS Plasmid-mediated colistin resistance encoded by mcr-1 was first documented in China during the routine surveillance of food animals. This has been followed by similar reports across a wide geographic area, in humans, animals, and the environment. The mcr-1 gene has been reported among human isolates in 29 countries, related to environmental samples in four countries, and in food animals and other animals in 28 countries. More recently, a second gene encoding resistance, mcr-2, has been isolated from porcine and bovine Escherichia coli.

METHODS 1917 corneae (1000 patients) were allocated to decades of age, classified according to Belin's ABCD KC grading system and the stage distribution was analysed. RESULTS 73 per cent (n=728) of the patients were males, 27% (n=272) were females. The highest KC prevalence occurred between 21 and 30 years (n=585 corneae, 294 patients). Regarding anterior (A) and posterior (B) curvature, the frequency of A was significantly higher than B in all age groups for stage 0, 1 and 2 (A0>B0; A1>B1; A2>B2; p<0.03, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test). There was no significant difference between the number of A3 and B3, but significantly more corneae were classified as B4 than A4 in all age groups (p<0.02). The most frequent A|B combinations were A4|B4 (n=451), A0|B0 (n=311), A2|B4 (n=242), A2|B2 (n=189) and A1|B2 (n=154). Concerning thinnest pachymetry (C), most corneae in all age groups were classified as C0>C1>C2>C3>C4 (p<0.04, Wilcoxon matched-pairs test). For the best distance visual acuity (D), a significantly higher number of corneae were classified as D1 compared to D0 (p<0.008; D1>D0>D2>D3>D4). CONCLUSION The stage distributions in all age groups were similar. Early KC rather becomes manifest in the posterior than the anterior corneal curvature whereas advanced stages of posterior corneal curvature coincide with early and advanced stages of anterior corneal curvature.

However, direct viral infection is not the only way that the former can affect the latter. Most adverse maternal events that end in hospitals have their genesis upstream in communities. Hospitals often represent a last opportunity to reverse a process that begins at a remove in space and time. The COVID-19 pandemic did not create these upstream injuries, but it has brought them to national attention, exacerbated them, and highlighted the need for health care providers to move out of the footprint of their institutions. The breach between community events that seed morbidity and hospitals that attempt rescues has grown in recent years, as the gap between rich and poor has grown and as maternity services in minority communities have closed. COVID-19 has become yet another barrier. For example, professional organizations have recommended a reduced number of prenatal visits, and the platforms hospitals use to substitute for some of these visits are not helpful to people who either lack the technology or the safe space in which to have confidential conversations with providers. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for departments of obstetrics and gynecology. Community-based organizations including legal professionals, health-home coordinators, and advocacy groups, surround almost every hospital, and can be willing partners with interested departments. COVID-19 has made it clearer than ever that it is time to step out of the footprint of our institutions, and to recognize that the need to find upstream opportunities to prevent downstream tragedies.

The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as public health emergency after it spread outside China to several countries. Thus, an assessment of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with novel estimation approaches is essential to the global debate. This study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to construct conceptual tools that examine the nexus between death from COVID-19 and confirmed cases. We collected daily data on four health indicators namely deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China. Due to the complexities of the COVID-19, we investigated the unobserved factors including environmental exposures accounting for the spread of the disease through human-to-human transmission. We used estimation methods capable of controlling for cross-sectional dependence, endogeneity, and unobserved heterogeneity. We predicted the impulse-response between confirmed cases of COVID-19 and COVID-19-attributable deaths. Our study revealed that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. We found a linear relationship between COVID-19 attributable deaths and confirmed cases whereas a nonlinear relationship was confirmed for the nexus between recovery cases and confirmed cases. The empirical evidence revealed that an increase in confirmed cases by 1% increases coronavirus attributable deaths by ~0.10%–~1.71% (95% CI). Our empirical results confirmed the presence of unobserved heterogeneity and common factors that facilitates the novel coronavirus attributable deaths caused by increased levels of confirmed cases. Yet, the role of such a medium that facilitates the transmission of COVID-19 remains unclear.

Surgical aspects such as energy dependent tissue response and tissue sealing to reduce bleeding are usually investigated in animal experiments. Extra-corporal organ models can provide the required experimental information without harming animals and thus reduce or even replace in vivo experiments. Here we describe the ex vivo ox-foot-model, which can be used for surgical investigations and for training purposes. In the ox-foot-model the vein remains in its anatomical bed under reproducible experimental conditions, i.e., blood perfusion, blood pressure, and temperature. Innovative endoluminal surgical procedures using laser light and radio frequency for varicosis treatment were tested. Treatment parameters were investigated systematically in a large number of samples. A standardized preclinical testing procedure could be established and optimized on the basis of acute macroscopic and histological findings. Further, optical coherence tomography could be evaluated as a time-saving diagnostic tool. The ox-foot-model is suitable for training surgical techniques relevant for the treatment of varicosis veins. It is a cost-effective alternative to conventional in vivo experiments, providing standardized experimental conditions and reproducible experimental results while respecting the Principles of Humane Experimental Techniques: Reduction, Refinement, and Replacement of animal experiments.",2012,"Sroka, Ronald; Weick, Kathrin; Steckmaier, Stefanie; Steckmaier, Bernd; Blagova, Radka; Sroka, Ina; Sadeghi-Azandaryani, Mojtaba; Maier, Johann; Schmedt, Claus-Georg",ALTEX,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.14573/altex.2012.4.403; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23138510/,6905295.0

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen of COVID-19, infects the human body using angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor identical to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic that occurred in 2002-2003. SARS-CoV-2 has a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 than to that of other species. Animal models that mimic the human disease are highly essential to develop therapeutics and vaccines against COVID-19. Here, we review transgenic mice that express human ACE2 in the airway and other epithelia and have shown to develop a rapidly lethal infection after intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV, the pathogen of SARS. This literature review aims to present the importance of utilizing the human ACE2 transgenic mouse model to better understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and develop both therapeutics and vaccines.",2020,"Lutz, Cathleen; Maher, Leigh; Lee, Charles; Kang, Wonyoung",Hum Genomics,,#526827,,,,,219282632.0

83978,nq2ss115,,Medline,Spatial variations in and environmental significance of nitrogen forms in river sediments from two different watersheds in eastern China.,10.1007/s10661-020-08283-5,,32388827,unk,"Nitrogen is considered an essential nutrient element limiting water productivity, and its distribution in sediments directly affects its release potential. This study aimed to analyse the spatial characteristics, distribution, and influence of nitrogen forms in two different river catchments situated in eastern China. Using sequential extraction methods, the study divided sediment nitrogen into four forms, namely, an ion-exchangeable form (IEF-N), weak acid-extractable form (WAEF-N), strong alkali-extractable form (SAEF-N), and strong oxidant-extractable form (SOEF-N). The results for the two catchments showed significant differences in the physicochemical properties as well as variations in space. The mean proportion of total transferable nitrogen (TTN) in the Anhe, Suihe, Dongtiaoxi, and Xitiaoxi rivers accounted for 50.64%, 32.87%, 34.63%, and 40.45%, respectively. The results also revealed a higher total TTN in the Hongze watershed than in the Tiaoxi watershed. The order of mean TTN in sediments from the Hongze watershed was SOEF-N > SAEF-N > IEF-N > WAEF-N, whereas that for the Tiaoxi watershed was SOEF-N > SAEF-N > WAEF-N > IEF-N. The distribution of nitrogen forms in the sediments was significantly impacted by the sediment composition and environmental factors, as shown by correlation and redundancy analysis (RDA).",2020-05-09,"Marip, Ja Bawk; Yuan, Xuyin; Zhu, Hai; Xu, Jian; Ye, Hongmeng; Zhou, Huihua; Nooni, Isaac Kwesi; Amankwah, Solomon Obiri Yeboah; Prempeh, Nana Agyemang; Norgbey, Eyram",Environmental monitoring and assessment,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10661-020-08283-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388827/,218561954.0
